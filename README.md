## Overview

This project focuses on evaluating the robustness of the rStar framework, a reasoning system for small language models (SLMs). The evaluation uses variations of the GSM8K dataset, highlighting the frameworkâ€™s strengths and limitations in handling diverse input modifications.

For more information please refer to our report.
