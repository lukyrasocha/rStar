Each box of pizza costs $8.50, so let\u2019s divide this remaining amount ($17) evenly into packages which would result as 17 / 8.5 =~ about 2 boxes (since we can only get whole numbers). Thus, Marie purchased approximately 2 boxes of pizza since you usually cannot purchase partial items like food or drinks. But strictly speaking mathematically, without considering practicality constraints, it implies around ~2. This value is close enough because buying exactly three boxes wouldn't come under original budget due to rounding off while converting cents to dollar figures. Hence, when rounded down; henceforth our solution remains valid till almost similar scenarios being practiced outside mathematical calculations itself.

Since we know every pizza costs $8.50, divide what\u2019s remaining ($17) by price per pizza ($8.50). This results into roughly approximately 1.9. Because you can't buy part of a pizza, it indicates Mary could only afford buying either zero or just one complete pizza depending upon whether rounding down or up respectively would adhere better within contextually sensible constraints around purchasing whole items like food quantities aren't typically fractionated; nonetheless strictly numerically based solely off raw calculation yield rounds upto 'about  2'.
