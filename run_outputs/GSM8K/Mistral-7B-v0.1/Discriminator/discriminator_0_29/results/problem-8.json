Firstly John drove nonstop until it turned into headache induced stand still as soon as possible which took him only about one quarter of the entire planned trip (which means approximately ~1/4*total distance).

Let\u2019s call such spot X henceforth . Next up comes our initial destination M again probably same place considering location matters when forgetting things or even running errands\u2026So let's set point L here too , backyard maybe ?

Therefore John traveled exactly as planned until it took him twice longer than anticipated due to heavy gridlock along the way home. It turned out to take double since only one car could travel through every minute. That means if instead everything ran smoothly according to plan without any delay or stop signage hindering progress, john would reach back within just over three rounds made off leaving workplace when heading towards city hall; thus reducing transit distance required per round trips needed daily!

Since it takes him twice as long when coming back compared to leaving, we can conclude he spent four times longer returning since halving the speeds while doubling duration results in quadrupling distances covered based on basic rules related to constant velocity calculations like https://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/constant-velocity.html . This equates into eight hours , meaning he was only moving for half(two)of these twelve cumulative segments i.e.,halfway through our previous calculation thus covering twenty additional blocks over what would normally occur according again to said resource above hence resulting in another forty mile return journey towards home overall totalling sixty miles driven backwards away or further still instead off course toward original destination location thereby confirmatively ensuring absence / separation status relative present residences despite seemingly proximal geographical placement; therefore concluding zero difference exists betwixt locations making them effectively equivalent spaces within respective reference frameworks providing mutual access regardless origin point variances due shared property boundaries notwithstanding inherent discrepancies otherwise existant amongst different jurisdictions controlling varying areas such streets etcetera consequently rendering any distinctions void absent unique individual claims vis-\u00e0-vis others who may contest assert rights relating comparable resources located similarly situated land parcels under competing titles potentially leading legal battles seeking precedence depending case specificities arising forthcomingly throughout litigation procedures occurring among conflicting parties aiming gain advantages leveraging judicial system interventions applicable hereunder general civil law statutes governing private individuals\u2019 affairs including disputes regarding rightful ownership holdings versus neighbors claiming equal entitlement concerning similar territories albeit differing proprietary interests pursuant title examination efforts undertaken preceding potential outcomes await resolution predicated upon fact verification process encompassing expert evidence provision coupled adjudicative reviews conducted subsequent courtroom hearings facilitating rulings adhering constitutional mandates preserving fundamental liberties whilst guaranteeing equality assurance respect accordance legislative norm dictations enforcing safeguards securing just treatment all constituents residing collectively community members irrespective national origins diversity ethnic background compositions social classes political views religious belief",

        " away or closer than initially planned.  Calculate using Speed=Distance/Time; Rearrange this formula as Distance=Speed*Time, thus apply it based off what we know about John\u2019s traveling details across these four segments \u2013 i) Drive straight without interruption (speed=60 miles per hour), ii) Stand still in Traffic jam(no movement hence no addition to overall displacement irrespective of duration); third journey through slow city lanes when moving finally resumes (reduced rate due probably bumper queues so use reduced road rates here which would equate lower speeds under normal circumstances compared to initial free flow conditions while also reducing expected completion times). Finally add everything together keeping mind certain directions might cancel other depending whether considering only resultant vectors along main intended path back toward original starting point if specified explicitly asked otherwise simply compute absolute value representation accounting complete journeys made both forward & reverse since returning implies completing course twice!

        " First calculate the speeds covered separately as follows: During the initial part when it was still easy journey -> Speed (u) => u=60 miles/hours When stuck due to slow movement inside city limits.. Duration spent without any movements(v).. v=0 And also calculating last bit->speed w=>w=80 Miles/Hour duration taken into consideration here ..t=(Time Taken)-> Total Time Given Here :~T_totaal=\u223c4 hrs From these we can conclude below calculations under different segments; Segment I ; ~Initial Journey::Distance Covered S=(Speed*time)=60*(3)mi=.\u2234 Distance .Segment II:(Due to Stand Still).Distanced Conntinued Upto this stage ::Dis=[Until reach Half Hour]=d+(VxT)_y\u2026.( V+W )\u00d7((T\u2212t)+C)Here , C=0 \u2026because no Car Movement occured since start till midway point....[as per "
