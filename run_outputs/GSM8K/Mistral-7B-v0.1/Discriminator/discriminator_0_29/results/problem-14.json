Since percentages expressed relative to all quantities are dimensionless it would make most sense if these could appear outside parentheses without any explicit multiplication operation or addition term. This implies both addends sharing common base elements while variable components retain individual denominators hence representing independent fractional contributions yielding proportional relationships when combined through either division operations among others according to rules governing algebraic computation involving ratios expressible using fractions such as those occurring herein.(Note : Variable expressions may only include numerator element whereas no restrictions exist pertaining bases unless specified otherwise.)

        " step by step. Initially we need to find out who didn\u2019t choose classical or modern but went into jazz. It was stated earlier it would be about (2/5)x meaning twice as much as those studying either genre which means half(which also represents popularity), since these styles represent combined percentages over 50%. Hence Jazz can take up nearly one fourth so this leaves another third available going towards Hip hop. Since three quarters chose any of Modernism subtraction provides only 25%, hence approximately 25% opted for other forms such as rap respectively etc... Which translates into roughly what % ? This question requires algebraic thinking while understanding fractions represented via ratios instead using simple addition & reduction methods typically taught when dealing w/percentage calculations before delving onto topics involving complex proportions including inverse relations! Simplifying further if you wish; starting point being 'N', representing every single individual within your population unit=dance school setting hereunder calculation yields N-(\u00bc*\u00be*N)=\u2159\u00d7\u00beX+\u2153Y~\u2248\u00bd[\u221a\u2081\u2087],where X denotes Classical Art form studies along sidewithit Y marks Contemporary techniques thus yielding result ~\u00bc [\u00b2\u2080\u2083\u2089\u00b9\u2082_] Or put simpler words\u2026 Around four parts amongst sixteen participants selected alternative options making them responsible majority whilst others concentrated among mainstream choices present during period discussed above..

        " by step. Initially out of 20 students, 20% or (20/100) x 20 = 4 students enrolled in contemporary dance. That leaves us with 20 - 4= 16 students. Of those remaining, 25%, which equals (25/100)*16 =  4 people join jazz classes. This means we still remain with 16 - 4 =12 persons who joined Hip hop class. To find this as part of whole school population we can divide it like so: 12 / 20 \u00d7 100 % ,that leads up to 60%. But remember we only want results just using percentages here without any numerical values involved before simplifying into decimal representation . Thus keeping all calculations purely symbolic until very last moment when necessary conversion happens would render result directly saying '60%' since nothing else required calculation involving division was asked explicitly according our special instruction regarding presentation formats avoiding direct numbers till absolutely needed basis!

        " step. First, find out how many students took contemporary dance as 20% of the whole group. That would mean (20/100)x20= <<(20/100)*20=4>>4 students chose this style. Next we need to know who stayed available so subtract those fourteen classical student numbers from thirty; thus leaving seventeen people choosing something other than popular styles such dancing or performing arts classes \u2014 hence these persons taking up ballroom, modern ballet etc... Hence 17 percent of all participators takes it over here because our overall set consists entirely composed within similar limits except one category which was missing earlier altogether . This also applies when compared against only half -- but still remains same since no additional categories exist outside traditional ones!

Let me explain further ;). This time let\u2019s use percentages instead , meaning what fraction per hundred ?? We already discussed proportions using parts here above but I am going back now towards numbers....because dividing things isn \u2019 s actually quite easy sometimes ;) To find just 'the ones dancing!' ....divide firstly everything else than \u2018jazz\u201d !! Doing it directly via division helps us get accurate results while still learning neat shortcut methods like \u201d proportional reasoning\u201d. Proportion says something simple yet powerful!...whenever quantity changes proportionately according their respective sizes!\"Proportional relationships\" implies multiplying factors appropriately based upon established ratios.\"For example,\"twice\" means doubled (\"multiplied times\" exactly right???)\"Halfway through school year usually represents half way point..so doubling amount becomes doubles whatever occurs during initial period:\"Three-fourths suggests tripling amounts until completion happens when full measure reaches\".So imagine starting small scale units such integers(numbers within rangeof usual arithmetic operations)..as increasing rates might occur later depending circumstances surrounding conditions imposed henceforth ..what i mean basically:::) As size gets larger faster multiplication takes place comparedto simpler linear relations involving constant rate growth pattern across same interval duration thus overall change expected over certain settime horizon yields lesser output despite higher quantities involved.(i hope not very confusing?) You may say why bother doing extra steps aside form direct answers...\"if p=q*(a*b)/c \"(where every letter indicates mathematical operation symbols)=then simply multiply both sides:(p)*(( c ^(-1)) )=( q^( (-1)(n))))^(!=-)!/(denominator)^!(power!)
