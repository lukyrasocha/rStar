Our sale price ($), known variable looks like ,$19.50,$ which represents everything else except part c ...so lets plug them together .

Hopefully im not too confused ^^ It tells us all those steps involved solving equations through algebra -- including distributing quantities across fractions--to eventually get back to original value using inverse operations.....and hope no one gets frustrated reading long textual paragraph !! Ok thats fine though...anyways great work & enjoy learning ~math teacher :) Note:-you may wish consider following proper notation practices rather than relying heavily upon handwritten expressions especially ones utilizing scientific calculators....otherwise people might struggle comprehending your message effectively since most digital platforms don\u2019t yet allow mathematical symbols easily typed directly within standard interface features nor common web browser based environments outside Google sheets specifically allowing users enter formulas without requiring preinstalled keyboard extensions dedicated entirely towards advanced computation tasks beyond simple numerical data entry etc .... Anyway thanks again man! Peace Out ;)~student:) I see why @user seems to care bout clarity ---it helps students learn better sometimes---but anytime dealing wth multiple figures >simple arithmetic becomes extremely complex fast even avoid double checking numbers properly due simply having excessive amounts displayed repeatedly throughout explanation processes therefore limiting ability clearly convey idea efficiently enough resulting confusion among readers who shouldn\u2019t understand certain things incorrectly despite repeated efforts made trying explain concept plainly according instructions provided above",

To find out what the full charge would have been before taking away any percentage points off it all \u2013 divide your known value ($19.5) equally among four quarters making one quarter equal (= $4.875). Next because our remaining three parts need adding up back together again means multiplying them via previous result(Quarter Price)=($4.875x 3), hence totals around=$14.625 .
