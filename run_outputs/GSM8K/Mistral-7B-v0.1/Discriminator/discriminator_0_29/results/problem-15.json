Your potential gain (increase) if you buy Jewelries which costs $5,000 initially may reach .025*($5,000)=$125 increase per piece so it equals ($5,000+$125=$5,125). Similarly calculate using price list of electronics , (.012*$8,000=~$96) so estimated selling price comes out only $(8,000+96=$8,096.) Hence maximum amount possible made through choosing one over another can be evaluated simply comparing these prices resulting in extra income generated being $$(5,125-$5,000=)$125 vs $.(-8,096-$8,000=-$96.)

Similarly find out the projected growth of your electronics shop through calculations following similar logic; since percentage change can also translate directly onto dollar terms when considering short term shifts such as these based only on initial values here we assume no compounding effect therefore multiply base amount times rate difference resulting equaling approximately $8,000* (1+ .012) ---> roughly about ,$8,096. Thus taking both options together add them altogether finding the smallest return i.e., lowest gain being subtractive way results becomes smaller than bigger addition thus choosing highest profits accordingly equalling maximum advantage yield hence minimum risk taken comes secondary benefit not just main aim leading us towards our decision best chance higher returns better position against future markets thereby ensuring successful outcome sooner instead later potentially saving thousands possibly millions depending upon exact timing & other variables factors involved perhaps most importantly realizing inherent uncertainty exists everywhere worldwide economy like any others due random events occurrences changing course fast sometimes dramatically unexpected upswings downswings happen routinely affect countless individuals often causing disastrous loss even those prepared financially well ahead cannot always protect oneself fully certainly though rarely enough might avoid all damage completely however unfortunately reality never stops surprising everyone constantly reminding lessons learned valuable experience gained yet still hopeful progresses toward ever improving human condition hopefully slowly steadily consistently getting closer desired goals finally achieving victory last frontiers conquerable challenges overcome hardships faced beyond mere survival but life quality itself enhanced greatly meaningfully genuine success matters deeply motivated action driven positive attitude reinforcing faith strength foundational belief personal determination essential foundation every individual building dream career launch business achieve anything possible simply doing what needs desperately required courage bravery inspiration passion energy drive resilience persistence tenacity focus dedication commitment sacrificial love family support friends comrades colleagues mentors advisors guides helping hands ready reach whenever called forth duty serve greater good altruistically generously selflessly benefiting society whole humankind collectively contributing shared responsibility mutual respect honesty integrity justice fairness toler",

We can conclude our calculation here so as the question asks us find what kindo increase represents greater growth we need therefore calculate percentage change thus using formula ((finalValue-originalVale)/orignialValue)*100=([$5,125-$5,000]/[$5,000])*100=($125/$5,000)*100=$2.5%.Thus since both increases came out positive but one resulted higher than another ,we know clearly buying the jewelery yields bigger gain hence overall better option over investing into technology thereby ultimately increasing net profits because lesser loss could potentially result due ot lower demand especially during times like recession(that might cause people shifting attention away towards luxurious things rather low priced ones),it also implies customer preferences play role considering current economy state etc...In conclusion although numbers appear promising yet careful analysis may lead decision makers towards choosing right strategy taking all relevant factors under consideration too !!!

To calculate the potential profits based off these assumptions: For plan A (if value rises): Profit_planA= initial investment*(increase rate/100)=$5,000*2.5%=~$125. This results into expected future value=$5,000+$125=$5,125 meaning gainable profit($5,125-$5,000)=$$125. Applying similar logic for option B(value rising); Initial investment=(initial amount)*rate % / conversion factor=[$(amount)-((number)(percent))]=[$8,000-(($8,000*.012)/$.012])]=-[(8k-.012)][-(.012/.012)](this simplifies downward leaving us simply $(and so not providing any monetary quantity representing change)$8,000+(=. . $$ Thus if aiming to optimize return per period without considering other elements such timeframe etc.; Under current prediction strategy I recommend selecting Option [A](choosing costlier item with higher projected earnings.)

This translates into additional amounts via multiplication (.025x$5,000=$125) /(.012 x $8,000)=$<<.025*5000=.012*.08=10>>$. Multiply those figures back onto themselves ($1,125+$10), therefore determining the maximal value attainable under these assumptions if choosing which item to invest upon purchasing it immediately prior to sale post advertised growth hike; i.e., take sum values derived above $(($1125+10)-(the cost)). Profits earned thus equate:$1135-$((summed prices before calculation)+-(initial costs). Therefore profits equal:(($5,125+$8,100)=$13,225$-($(5,000+$8,000)=$13,000))=-$(subtract original expendituresfromfinalvalues obtainedthereaftertoobtaintotalprofitearnedthroughthisoperation); $-=(13225-13000).

This means its expected return equals (($8000)*(1.2/100))= $96 extra. Finally subtract any cost you initially paid out of pocket when purchasing whichever item was chosen from above your original spending power ($5,000 for jewelry; $8,000 for electronics). Since we only know these prices without additional information concerning price reduction options like discount rates, taxes etc., assume no such changes apply as well, thus leaving our results unaltered. To find which investment plan yields higher returns consider comparing values obtained via adding those projected profits onto their base amounts vs simply calculating differences individually based off starting figures..

        " $5125. Likewise, if we calculate it for electronics, their expected increased price because of predicted rise could be calculated as follows \u2013 take original costing ($8,000) and multiply by percentage increase (1.2%). This equals $(8000*0.012)=$96. Add these calculations together to get future values, which indicate possible profits per piece; hence our calculation becomes : $5125+96=$5221 gained from choosing jewelery vs $$(8000*1.012)+($8000*$1.012-$8000)= \\$8096 gain if opting Electronic Gadgets respectively. Given both options lead towards different markets without additional costs being mentioned thus far into conversation ; based purely off projected earnings , highest prospective turnout comes via picking up electrical devices considering them yield higher return overtime . Hence investment wise selecting ELECTRONICAL GOODS MATRIX INDEX STOCK OFFERING IS THE OPTIMAL CHOICE WITH AN ASSESSED PROFIT OF ~$\\$8096 US DOLLARS APPROXIMATE DUE TO LOW NET MARKET RISK COMPROMISE.

Thus we determine electronics offered larger appreciation over time when compared against jewelry as per our estimates under those specific conditions. Therefore it\u2019d seem wise if all other factors held constant; purchasing Electronic Gadgets initially appears better investment strategy seeing their projected growth outstrips Jewelery counterpart here leading towards possible greater profits later down line..
