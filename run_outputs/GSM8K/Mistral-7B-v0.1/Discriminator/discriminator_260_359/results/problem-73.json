Using similar logic to calculate Cozy Homes\u2019 fee we get this formula ->$1,100[advance]+(9*250)${monthly payoffs}->$1,100+2,250=$3,350. To find out what Robert needs to save before purchasing either piece or furnishing combination subtracting one option from another i.e.,Furniture Untied-$1,350-$cozy homes=,-$$1,100$-Cozy homeshows $-($3,450)-(-$3,350)=-(money saved).

Here we can see which store lets you keep your cash flow open while providing all needed services upfront, compared against making regular deposits into savings every year rather investing it elsewhere or buying other unnecessary things later down the road..
