This results into $$900$. Next identify which percentage off occurred so you can figureout later how much cash exchanges hands during purchase period.; since the question stated \"buying them...\"with\"a(n)\"percentage,\"the relevant value here would thus refer to %($40), hence we need to multiply $($900)*$(40/100)=$$360$; finally solve dollar equation:$900-$360=$$540$, indicating Davos ended up spending only fifty four hundred pennies when completing said transaction under discussed circumstances described earlier within subject material provided..

Since this question asks about buying multiple items we multiply our result above ($$) by $-(+)$. We find out that if only purchasing one item it costs $$-. As David was asked whether these same conditions apply when shopping twice what happens mathematically is instead using both numbers involved within parentheses first; before applying exponentiation rules later\u2014this allows us calculate value accurately without making mistakes like assuming addition versus multiplication takes precedence!
