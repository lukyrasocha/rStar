        " that \u201cSamantha has $25 million\u201d which suggests it was supposed to say \"$25\". Correcting this makes sense since we know later in sentences about their respective sums \u2013 so let us take that as accurate information instead. That means if Carmen starts off with $100 (given), Samantha would have $100+$25=$<<100+25=125>>125 because it\u2019s said above that she owns $25 more than what Carmen owes; whereas Daisy ends up having just over double Samantha\u2019s stash ($50 extra) when stated below hence putting hers equal to $\\frac{1}{2}*$($125$)+\\$50=\\$112\\. Adding these together gets one whole dollar figure representing all cash amassments made collectively equals out to $100+$125+$112.$ Hence getting approximately $337$.

Since Daisy also contributes this amount but adds another $50$, you multiply $225*$ (Daisy\u2019s contribution) , which equals $$225*50 or$$11,250$. Hence since these amounts include every girl separately as well as the sum contributed collectively among them earlier mentioned; adding those totals results into having everything accounted for altogether yielding hence: $$\\mathbf{Total~Money} = \\mathbf{(Samantha+\\text{dollars}) +\\text{dollars}+ (\\text{total collected })} =\\;\\;\\;(125)+\\;\\;(\\textbf{$15})$\\;{\\bf{}Figuring \\;this\\; out\\;} \\\\=\\;\\quad {\\bf{}\\implies Total\\\\Money}$ =\\; \\$11,\\!375$\\end{array}$$ Therefore finally calculating $\\boxed{Total Money}= \\$11,375$ dollars. Indeed our strategy included finding just the necessary sums first before proceeding towards their aggregation later when needed while taking proper care not leaving anything aside because such could prove critical otherwise especially considering scenarios involving multiple participants across different levels/categories affecting outcome values etc.. This approach works best mainly due its versatility coupled wiht simplicity making complex calculations manageable even without resorting directly against advanced concepts thus allowing one avoid getting overwhelmed thereby fostering clarity amongst themselves further helping identify potential errors faster during problem solving processes leading ultimately toward correct solution paths unlike going through lengthier alternative methods often resultinginto unintended mistakes arisingfrom human fallibilitywhichmustbeconsideredsinceanycomputersystemcanpossiblymakeunpredictableresultsafterallrightnowhereasmanyplacesbecausethereallibertyexistswitheverythingthatscreatedgivenhoweveritshouldneverbeassumedthatsuchcannothappenwithoutreasonandprobabilityprovidedaproperunderstandingofitsnaturealsoavoidablesuchoutcomeseitherwhenworkingaloneorwecooperateingroupsallowingenvironmentsofmutualhelpfulnessbasedupontrustandrespect",

Addition here just represents comparing values not adding them as usual arithmetic operations apply only when doing calculations/arithmetic problems involving numbers etc., so subtracting equals lower value because higher amounts don\u2019t get reduced but remain constant even though lesser ones increase their relative share; therefore subtraction doesn't change anything except making everything smaller while increasing proportions among those who receive larger shares like ourselves!

Explanation: Statement B mentions that student loan debt often exceeds tuition costs due to additional expenses such as books and living arrangements not covered by direct institutional fees (inflation). Hence, students find themselves spending their entire financial aid package just to manage basic needs over four years; therefore, borrowing heavily through federal subsidized Stafford Loans may seem prudent when taking out small amounts immediately upon entrance but could result in significant cumulative repayment obligations post graduation.

Let me illustrate it further.\"While Sarah appreciated traditional painting methods due to their historical significance, John found contemporary techniques like digital artwork engaging because they enabled infinite experimentation,\" This example features 'while'-used for presenting one point before introducing opposing viewpoints ('John') but doesn't delineate who holds precedence clearly nor provides sufficient context regarding why modern methodologies might appeal specifically (possibly hinting towards innovation, accessibility, etc.). It can definitely improve upon clarifying roles when indicating preference order.
