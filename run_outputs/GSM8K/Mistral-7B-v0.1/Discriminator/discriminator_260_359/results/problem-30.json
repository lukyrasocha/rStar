As per information provided, if we divide this sum (which equals their total individual counts) into ten equal parts(because overall awards awarded was mentioned as 'ten'), one part would represent what those who received any single award worth represented i.e., One portion represents every medal given; so dividing these portions back again multiplies them until matching original quantity calculated previously.

        " medals if their combined count was tenfold what it currently stands as per instruction; since we know this quantity (39) represents 'tens time fewer', divide it by 10 to understand the base value before multiplication. Hereafter take away another multiple of tens until you reach zero because only full counts can occur i.e., no partially awarded medal scenarios exist. Thusly deducting sets of 10 yields us 4 additional complete calculations implying the original multiplicative factor is fourteen(x4). Therefore multiply back upwards those completed factors resulting into :  1st set =>  39/10= 3 remainder    rnd down .
