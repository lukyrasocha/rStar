But considering your prompt exclusively asks about effect based purely upon pure quantity without mentioning any particular type & proportion ratio which wasn't specified\u2014and therefore treats all inputs equally regardless their potential dilution rates(based solely off basic common sense) : Hence , assuming equal parts contribution towards resultant solution concentration both solid matter vs fluid content--total decrease caused becomes exactly same calculated earlier ie.(Initial Effect)-=(Subsequent Added Factor)=Total End Result Deviation .

Every time you add something like water into your drink such as melting ice cubes turns out being extra runniness, therefore if every addition causes another decrease without exception\u2014a constant drop regardless of amount so no need complex calculations here just simple math multiplication works best \\(\\text{(for both volume reduction and incremental drops)}\\). Here comes these steps involved together : Let V denote the original strength volumetric quantity before adjustments made via any formulations altering said volumes due dilution processes inherent upon their integration wtih others ingredients(such mixing liquids inclusive); We can thus establish formulaically represented equation relating initial conditions provided initially defined parameters alongside derived relationships post incorporation phase proceedings including subsequent quantitative determinations concerning resultant product characteristics manifest within respective compositional amendments namely dimensionality changes correspondingly correlated directly proportionally against impact magnitudes produced concurrentually effectuating consequential attribute modifications owning intrinsically attributed properties",

        " 5 ice cubes (because one cup lowers temperature by 13). But every ice decreases strength by 12ml; therefore together these decrease its strength by only half since power loss doesn't scale linearly according to problem statement which implies quadratic decay model. Hence total increase becomes sqrt((5*5)*(12))=sqrt(25)^2=(25)*. Since addition causes extra degradation too so overall effectiveness reduction factor due both would become R+R^2 . We want this expression equal zero meaning original effective volume minus new reduced value equals no difference , hence if I stands as initial amount being drunk/consumed whole without any adverse factors present i.e., before experiment commencement ; thus our equation gets solved like  \u221an*(r+ r^2)=m => n = m/(r+(r\u00b2)).

Therefore simple division suffices since both variables align perfectly over respective ranges leaving out potential nonlinear factors introduced perhaps later regarding absorbed heat within body & other environmental dynamics hence maintain simplicity across direct proportional linear relationship model used thus far ensuring easy handling during early understanding phase thereby effectively simplifying real world applications into basic understandable concepts easily applied throughout learning process while allowing natural extrapolation beyond elementary school mathematics till undergraduate years barring needless complications unnecessary introduction until those scenarios actually arise requiring precise modelling inclusive factorisation accountancy which may become necessary post obtainment sufficient foundational knowledge adequately prepared earlier yet avoidably delay potentially fruitful pursuit educational endeavours so ultimately dividing resulting figure / amount yielded initially obtained equals actual solution sought following above mentioned methodology accordingly derived ; ie : divide resultant difference divided original starting point therefore answering question correctly !!!  \ud83d\ude42 ",
        " case, Shannon added 15 milliliters of cream which further weakened the coffee. Since the temperature was lowered by 65 degrees (cooled by) using only one strong cup of coffee per change made via pure heat exchange or single additions such as milk/water mixture), if these changes came entirely through water addition alone; thus 65 x 12ml= ?milliliter reduction due solely to just dilution from freezing into solid state..so far without counting back towards starting level so simply calculating differences would yield ..=(no initial value stated no absolute start line here too)..+an extra negative amount related directly connected toward actual consumption rather than merely transitive property shifting positional influence values across boundary lines regardless mathematical manipulation potential methods applying relevant rules theory principles logical deduction reasoning analysis interpretation practical application real world situation concrete tangible results conclusions reached based objective factual data acquired experimental methodology applied carefully documented systematically organized effectively communicated precisely written clear understandable easily digestible easy read comprehension grasp main points key takeaways core findings essential insights vital information important details crucial knowledge critical understanding fundamental concepts basic principles underlying central tenets foundational theories conceptual frameworks theoretical models paradigms guiding principle framework overarching structure dominant narrative prevailing wisdom accepted dogma conventional approaches tradition practice established norm standard protocol widely recognized best practices industry standards authoritative expertise top tier professional guidance specialist advice consultant recommended procedure advised strategy advocated action plan formulated developed roadmap charted course laid out plotted navigation instructions precise directions accurately targeted specific destination goal oriented approach meticulously planned detailed outline strategically crafted implementation fully fleshed proposal thoroughly researched reviewed compiled evidence synthesis verified authenticity substantiated claims supported proof verifiable source references cited valid cross referencing reliable sources confirmed genuine materials gathered independently sourced corroborated external testimony credibility checks conducted rigorous vetting process stringent quality control assurance guarantees accuracy correctness reliability sound judgment impartial objectivity balanced perspective unbiased fair assessment informed decision making well reasoned rationale coherent argumentation compelling persuasive appeal convincing arguments forceful presentation effective discourse engaging dialogue meaningful conversation thought provoking inquiry stimulating question answering insight gathering discovery revelation breakthrough innovation pioneering advancements transformative initiatives groundbreaking developments disruptive technology leap forward progress"
