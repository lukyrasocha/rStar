We know initial conditions value was 3 , drop event took place midway meaning half way average/max effort thus halving original incremental additions making math simpler;`(a)/2=(b)*w+(c)`. Where `- w`: elapsed work period prior to mishap/`-(c)`, Initial objective state set forth `.j(f )===`value just after all variables changed.` or equivalent formula--the current states position . \rSince no previous info implied capacity limits ; lets make assumption :`- max skill level reached ~~before~~drop occured / maximum potential achievable outcome under circumstances available & opportunity provided---so whatever was achieved right after becoming skilled enough without hitting ceiling limit allowed him reaching such height while performing yet didn't allow recovering post catastrophe loss... It follows what remains unaffected due sudden misfortune stays intact within unchanged context parameters regardless impact effect magnitude ! Therefore remaining quantity equal sum(`3+(d),(d))`. Given data point suggests only single missing item accounted among trio hence calculating necessary values involved yields: `Total Juggled Item Quantity Post Mishap Equation :- f=(x)-[(u)(y)] ===> Total Items Remaining While Performing Actual Showcase:=sum('Remainder Objects',[['Initial Skill Level','Maximum Reached State During Performance'],[-1,-((3+1)+(-3))] ]);` Hence substituting actual numerical digits into equation above leads straightaway towards solution..
