Explanation : Here one simple method works ; just multiply the quantity times its price using decimal multiplication which avoid adding extra zeros afterwards or misplaced decimals during calculation steps when handling fractions directly. We calculate multiplying quantities together before addition because sometimes doing these operations separately may result erroneous answers due numerical errors caused bc fractional parts getting confusing/lost while working out numbers manually like if trying multiple calculations involving such small changes across big sums without proper attention paid towards maintaining uniformity throughout every single procedure performed along way through computing processes involved... Another option can involve breaking down things into smaller subsets etc., but those methods tend time consuming rather efficient ones used here instead especially considering speed factor mentioned above.... Moreover taking care about precision matters important since slight variances could impact overall results hence requiring accuracy levels maintained consistently over course periods thus helping users keep everything aligned correctly once calculating various factors related mathematical problems including pricing scenarios alike!
