        " store. Firstly, let\u2019s calculate what was spent at first. It's known that each toy car costs $2 so six would amount to 6 times $2 which equals to $(2 \\times 6)$. Additionally it can also be said that each teddy bear costs $1 thus altogether ten items mean ten bucks i.e., ( $1\\times{10}$ ) Hence finally we subtract this ($(2 \\times 6) + ( {$1} \\times {10})$). Calculate all above operations within brackets before subtraction as stated earlier : $$28-(12+10)$$So ,$$28-(12+10)=28-22=<|end_of_instructions|>",
        " 5 teddy bears. It means he spent (6*$2) +(5*$1)=$17+$5=$22. Hence the first sum was wrong, because as mentioned previously one dollar was forgotten ($1). Anyway so without this we would say only $(17+5)*1=22$. With these expenses deducting them outta initial amount we get;$28-(17)$$(-\\mathrm{and-} -\\underline{\\phantom{$1}}$$-(\\mathbf{1})) \\quad\\to \\,$$28-$$\\,$22=\\boxed{\\$6}$. This also explains why I said earlier our solution doesn\u2019t match your problem since it didn\u2019t mention if or not Dean asked back any change! ",
        " $2 which totals up to $12 (since 6*2=12). Every Teddy Bear was priced as $1 hence making it all together equals ten ($1x5=$5) .

        " This means the cost of all the toy cars was (6*2=<<6*2=12>>)12, and the cost of all the teddy bears was (5*1=<<5*1=5>>)5. Thus we find out that the entire expenditure including both types of goods totals together ((6+5)*((2)+(1))=$23). Since every dollar counts towards purchase therefore when adding up what came first i.e., spending as well as bonus received it equals ($28-$23+$10) which makes it exactly$25 . Because once you spend or pay something , your amount increases accordingly hence $(28-(($23)))+(10)$ thus finally results into being twenty-five bucks but since this can also mean just taking away everything spent so here simply put would be calculating :$(initial_amount -(spent))=(remaining)\"which translates mathematically\"to say \"$(28-(23)=$$(5)$thus resulting ultimately to having $5 leftover remaining.\" And yet if one wishes not to involve such arithmetic jargon rather keeping its simplicity like 'after receiving additional funds & subtracting already accumulated purchases', equation becomes merely written as:$ initial\\_money=[Spent Amount]+[Extra Bonus]that simplifies down to:= $[Remainder]=Initial Money $- Spent Therefore putting values yields:${FinalAmount}=(${Total Initial})-([$Cost Per Toy Cars]*[$NumberOfToyCars])-([CostPerTeddyBear]*[$Numberofteddybears]),or,$={FinalBalance}=\\({28}-{[\\(6*\\$(2)]}+[\\(5*\\$(1))]},putting figures instead leaves uswith:=${FinalBalance}={{(\\(28\\)-\\{(6*2\\}-\\{(5*\\$(1)\\}\\)};so ${FinalBalance}=={{$\\(5}}$and again remember original task doesn\u2019t necessarily revolved around calculations nor even equations per se indeed our narrative focused mainly on understanding scenarios related to currency management while maintaining clarity using layman words albeit without explicitly stating formulas\".
