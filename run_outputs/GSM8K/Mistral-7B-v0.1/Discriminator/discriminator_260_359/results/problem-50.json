Suit cost per item: ($100*6) + ($50*3) = $600+$150 = $750 Total thus far without flights= $750 We also need to factor in expected saving=$2000 This means if he starts off planning to split every dollar into three parts; travel(including flights), food&hotel & shopping/$6000-$2000($4000)$x 2 out of which one part remains untouchable until next time so let say$1333 . It leaves us $1667 available towards initial estimate but not sure since it was said initially ,he plans whole sum exactly around baggage purchase price plus all other items including airfare! What about remaining balance post deduction when accounting just mentioned aspects alone aside already known details??

But actually $\\displaystyle {X}={(700)+({\\color{Blue}500})}$, or {$700+$500$}={$1200$}. Hence if our aim is just calculating amounts used; ,then $$\\sum_c({cost}_{items/expenses})$$equals $\\{700+150\\}$={$850$}; This means these three purchases consume only about ${\\frac{850}{6000}}\\approx$ {'0.14'}of budget allocated initially. As per goal stated earlier in question ({saving}); therefore remaining funds can allotted toward purchase gift bags . Thus required quantity may computed thusly : let him allocate {}%{'{:,.0f}%'.format(-(round((\\$6000-\\$2000)/{$\\ 850$}*.1)),',')]} ','{%}' of initial available dollarage ; hence {:,.0f} '.{} %'' translates herein roughly into (:,--)${82\\%}$ ('{delimiter}:,-{comma:%},` `}`).

Finally , we get remaining balance => $6000-$1950=$4050 That value represents potential gift funds but since he also wants to keep aside savings worth $2000 before going ahead further calculations regarding potential individual partner budgets would need additional data such as whether there is any group or division responsibility assigned towards their respective amounts; if not just distribute equally among them -> Total individuals : Let\u2019s assume n ; Gift budget per person assuming no particular roles ~=(remaining fund)-(savings desired); thus formula becomes ((Remaining Fund- Savings Desired)/Total Individual Budget Candidates)).

Therefore, adding what it cost him till date including the planned expenses leaves us $((750+1200))+ ((($x)-$4000)). Simplifying further gives you our desired value we wish to find set out through variables such as those already noted above i.e., 'the amount remaining'. Thus all considered sums together lead one towards figuring out whatever remains when subtracted form the target figure/initial budget respectively resulting into finding exactly '$X', hence indicating precisely \"$remainder\".

Therefore, he spends $4000-$3150=$850 leftover available before purchasing any gift items or miscellaneous expenses during the course of traveling overseas\u2014a sizable budget even if unintended splurges occur due to unexpected emergencies while abroad..
