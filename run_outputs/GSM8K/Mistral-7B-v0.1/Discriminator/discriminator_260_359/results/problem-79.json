Thus, calculating animal count, Farmer brown owns 20 cows plus half as numerous amount of chickens thus resulting into having  20+(2*20)= 60 animals in total. To determine livestock size, let\u2019s begin analyzing it per species\u2014Chickens typically possess around four limbs while Cattle usually exhibit six feet. By multiplying these values against their respective populations (consisting of thirty bipeds i.e., Chickens & twenty quadrupeds namely Livestock), one computes Leg totality through multiplication followed by cumulation formulaically expressed below:: Total Animal Limbs=(cows*legs)+(chickens*legs). Upon executing said calculation,,Total legage equals [CowLimbs]=[LegCountPerCat]*[NumberOfAnimals]=[[number]]*4=[animalQuantity]. Similarly, Equivalent computation yields=> ChickenHoofiness:=AnimalPopulation_{Chickens}*{BibiousStrokes}. This approach allows us comprehend complete counts within entirety enlistment of both sets whether individually tabulated yet amalgamated upon requisite calculations respectively yielding LIVESCOPELEGAGE COUNT OF => [(CATTLE)*({LIMBNUMBER}{FORWARDED}))]+[(CHICKENS)({DIAGONALSTROKECOUNT}]==>[POWERMANAGER](([Vegetable][Mammal])/{AnimalToEggProductConversionRatio}) ==> {DURATION}(($[{INPUTNUM}-1$]{multiplicator}=${OUTPUTNUM})$ && {${[CONVERTERTOBASECODESEQUENCE]$}/{$[${\"PowerUser\":true}\"[\"TIME\"]}$}).

Therefore, since there are twice as many chickens as cows \u2013 meaning double the quantity\u2014there would be 40 chickens (because 2 times twenty equals forty). Find out how many cow hooves exist using existing information about 'legs'. Each cow has four leg hoof pairs because one animal needs only two feet per individual. Multiply these values together; hence  20*4 results into 80 pairings/hoof sets for all the cattle present on the ranch.
