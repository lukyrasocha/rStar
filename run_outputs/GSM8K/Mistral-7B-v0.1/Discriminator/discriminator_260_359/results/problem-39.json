Therefore, if we multiply this distance (daily) by the frequency of commute(monthly), it would equal amount paid every time without considering cost ascribed towards traveling over longer period (year). Thus let us first calculate all costs associated with short duration periods before calculating annual fee; Monthly Travel Fee=cost_per_mile*roundtrip_miles+bonus=$2/mi*$120/trip+$150 . This amounts up to$240+$150 i.e., $390 every month or approximately $390*(year months)/month=.
