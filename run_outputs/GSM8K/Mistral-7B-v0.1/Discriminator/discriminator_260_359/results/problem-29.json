We also know that faster car went through its course twice while taking only once during normal circumstances due not being hindered but still maintain pace because it operates outside regular traffic rules without fear thus allowing itself free movement hence covering doubled ground thereby becoming our new calculation base so considering all these factors together lets apply math here ,now based off those equations above first compute average rate achieved overtime period before applying next section below ;which takes into account multiple variables includingbutnot limitedtospeed differentialsohaving effect like acceleration decelerationbrakes etc.(i)_the_totaldistancedeltaTissumoftwoequalpartsdeltaDandDeltaTeachinglynamethatitwassplitintothetwohalveswithonehalfspentonfirstsegmentwherefastevelachangedfrom60toshortestnownegativevalueasitslowenoughthanusualwhilekeepingspeedconstantthroughthatsectionbeforechanginextraordinarylateralacceleratedpaceforsecondpartthencomputemaxdistancecoveredereducedoveralltraveldurationusingthesestepsabovewhencewerequiredanalternateapproachtotimecalculationssinceouroriginalproblemhaschangedintothisnewscenariorequirementsthataredifficultifromstandardwayforwardtheresimplymorecomplexityinvolvedinthinkingprocessdueofthefactsonwardsuchasesubsettedquestionslike\"HowlongDidItTakeToTravelThisMilesAtThatSpeed?(whatwasyourinitialcondition),(howfastdidyoustart)(whyorwhen),..etc.;thereforebasedoffthesimplerversionformostlikelyunfitablesolutionbecauseevensimpliermathematicaloperatorsareresultantsynthesisproce$$\\text{Time} = \\frac{\\text{TotalDistance}}{\\text{Speed}} \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad T_{\\text{slow}}(carspeed)=\\frac{D}{S_{c}(1/2)}",

        " Its average speed is calculated as 480 / (t) mph, which implies {eq}480/t{/eq}=60 or simply {eq}480=60*t{/eq}. Solving yields ~8hrrs(or actually around  7 hrs and 20 min). Since its slower version goes only one third faster than before ,it covers any road segment three times longer i .e approximately~ twice as long; hence it takes also roughly doubled amount of realtime. Consequently : This would mean about 2*{fast case duration}, yielding ~{14 hrrs }(more precisely approx.(14hrr sand 1 min)). Hence if you look carefully though what these variables represent , your solution doesn't correspond anymore to reality :) Remember! They go different ways along exactly parallel paths.

Since both vehicles need covering this full ground ,we divide said pace up amongst them equally evenly spaced out according to their speeds; hence if we assume Car_fast makes twice the trip than what our second vehicle needs doing...so dividing these numbers results us having Time=Distance/(CarFastVelocity)=t_slow => DistanceOfEachSide=.5*carFastSpeed===>timeElapsedInTwoPhases ===> ((Time)/two)+((TotalDistance)*(.5))..simplifying yields  4hr+((480mi)(.5fps)).

Our original expression would still apply but first get rid off denominators which cancel both ways resulting into equation like such \\( \\frac{h}{1}=v*t \\) . Solving yields h=vt , multiply both sides times v yielding VT = H ; take reverse solving yield solution becomes T=\\( \\frac {H} {\\text{V}} \\).

Calculate the amount of time it would take the first vehicle or one driving in the fast lane to reach its destination mileage of  480 miles as this value represents velocity times duration so use v=d/t rearranged therefore solve using dt=(v)/(d). It implies ((480 miles )/(velocity)) hours equal((dt)+hours), since you know velicityis60MPH plug into equation    dt((60 MPH))hours+hrs.=480 Miles , divide both sides by 60Miles per hour yield dividing(480 Milesinches)(Velocityinchps)=divide(60ChPSPs).

Hence determine also if both sides equal under certain conditions using laws like PVT relations etc. Here\u2019s my attempt below: Let y_fastlane represent the speed of the car in the fast lane, so: y_fastlane = 60 mph What happens as p changes?.

        " hour to go 60miles so it would take (60 / 60) X 480 mph=  480 hours to drive for 480 miles . Since this one went twice as long since its going only doing 30mph which means every mile requires double amount ot what the other driven ,it required just under double or exactly less than 480minutes. This totals up too about around either way close but still over ~8hours worth(because if you divide both sides above your original equation through everything including multiplying them together )to account we could say closer rounded down towards even slightly smaller times hence approximately eight hours not four due to slower rate altho actual result is right near said fortyeight without rounding.. Time taken equals ((distance_travel)/speed)_timeshowever_(multiply!):=(time\u00d7speed),andweknowthatforthiscar:(DistanceTravel)=(Time\u00d7Speed);thereforeourfinalanswerisaroundabout8 hourswith~8 beingtheclosestcorrect valuewithoutusingmath.(sinceeventhoughbothresultsetsameyoucouldnotuse mathifyneedexactaccuracy).",
        " / 60 = <<480/60=8>>8 hours to go 480 miles (This calculation uses the formula Time = Distance Travelled / Speed).

To begin breaking down the solution, first establish what we know about both vehicles involved which serves as our foundation for calculation purposes (fast lane speeds vs slower lanes). Keep track separately so mistakes less likely occur during transition phases towards answering 'x.'
