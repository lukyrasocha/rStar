We can see that going from $1000 to $1100 represents an increase ($1100-$1000=$100) as opposed to no trade due to switching products. Compute the percent increase using this formula [(new value \u2013 old value)/old value]*100%. Using these values we get [($1100/$1000)-1]x100% =>  10% higher profits since moving away from tractors manufacturing towards producing silos translates into net gain in revenue generation despite lower production rate. The answer is: 10 %.",

It results in `a%` greater profits than before. Therefore, the factories\u2019 current earnings constitute % compared with its previous figures. Let us calculate it out numerically; first we find our difference ($1100 -$1000) yielding $100 extra every day. Next convert into percent ((100/$1000)*100).

This equals (1.1)(100%) which results in 110% or just over double the amount as before when rounded off; thus we can say it increased about 10%, since going up one hundred percent represents doubling. Therefore, compared to earning $1000/daily previously while selling only ten units, currently receiving $1100/daily whilst still maintaining sales efficiency via reducing product quantity increases profit margin by around 10% due to heightened unit price combined with lower output volume thereby achieving economies of scale. Thus answering your query succinctly here...

Your previous figure turns up being .10, converting it furthermore implies increasing sales percentages about one fifth if converted directly into standard numbers.

        " now is 5 * 220 = 1100 dollars. To find out what percent increase it represents we use this formula (new amount / old amount) - 1 multiplied by 100%. It looks like [(1100/1000)-1]*100% which simplifies down to 10%. That\u2019s right because if you buy something cheaper its better deal. Percentage decrease cannot be positive when price decreases! As expected I calculated incorrectly (-). Thanks everyone :) Good luck answering your own question though!!\ud83e\udd13 And thanks again guys...you all rock\u270c\ufe0f Happy Holidays!!!",

To find out percent change using formula \u2013 `(Difference / Original ) X  100`, Firstly determine changes values **Current revenue `= units_produced \u00d7 price`** -> `Cost = Revenue \u00f7 Price`. Hence Cost = `$(New Sales)/($price)` \u2192 We know New Daily Sale Units & New Per Unit Price so plug these details into Formula:`Percentage Change=( Current \u2212 Original)\u00d7100/(original)=(Silos produced*revenue\u2013 Tractors Sold*(Price))/Tractors\u00a0Produced*`\u2192 Using Formulas we get :=> Silos earned $(5*$220)-(($10)*10)$// => $\\frac{\\${{(5 \\times {220})} - ({10}\\times {10})}}{({10})\\times {$}}\\%$.
