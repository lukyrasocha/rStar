To find out how much money was used overall to purchase these packages (several steps), we need first calculate separately how much was spent on buying Tomato seeds and Celery seeds. Multiply the quantity of Tomato Seeds packaged times their respective Cost Price ($40). This computes as follows; [Cost Of Tomatoes] ->(No Packets) X No Selling_Rate->[Tomatoes Purchased]=[$40]*[(NumberOfPackagesPurchased)]=($)=X{[packet]}->{y}->{$}.
