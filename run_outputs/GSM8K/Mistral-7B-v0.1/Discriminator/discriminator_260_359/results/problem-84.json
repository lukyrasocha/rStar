We know that Juice Box B\u2019s price is going to be \\(A + 5\\) (because it's stated as being 5 dollar higher), therefore this equals \\((4) + (5)\\) => \\(9\\). Similarly; we also calculate Jicse Boxt C\u2019s cost into \u201c(Price of juice box A)+(price difference)\", hence (\\(4))+(7)\\)=\\((11)\\). To determine what amount more Juice box C was compared to Juice box B you need to subtract Juice box B\u2019s value using our previous calculations from Juice box C\u2018s cost calculated earlier (\\(11)-(9)\\)), yielding us \\(\\(2)\\). Thus according to available information when looking only upwards through hierarchy, Juice box C spent about(\\$2)$^more_than^juiceboxB$. Let me know if anything needs further clarification! I am here to help clarify things. Does everything make sense so far?? Yes, but can you explain again why adding \\$5 means JuiceBox B is $$$$**9*****$ right above JuiceBox A pricing structure (**${}$*$? No worries! Here goes...
