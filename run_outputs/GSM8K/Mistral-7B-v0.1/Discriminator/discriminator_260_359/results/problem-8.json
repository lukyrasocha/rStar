It means these values describe exactly what you want but without including another variable so let us remove them next . This equation just needs numbers because only those matter not their units , therefore if multiplied our result changes sign meaning negative becomes positive again since both factors are greater than zero while opposite sides change signs accordingto order rule multiplication property .
