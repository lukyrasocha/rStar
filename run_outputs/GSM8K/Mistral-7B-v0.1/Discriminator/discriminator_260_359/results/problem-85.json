Three multiplied by fifty equal seventy-five legs three ten less than eighty divided by what if we need to calculate it using division but still expressing 'three tens less'. One way to phrase this expression would be to first identify thirty as \"three tens\" and subtract seven because \"ten fewer\" means going down by single units towards zero which translates into minus sevens when counting backward from twenty. Thus expressed verbatim including word substitution without changing meaning or numerical value involved can yield something like \"[Fifty] [table(s)], plus [-seven]([legs)] per ([fortytables]).
