Adding these both numbers together shows what all jobs made ($275+$200)= $475 but since she was able to start off her phones cost before working adding it up comes out like this: Phone Cost + initial savings - Total Earned Working Since we know the starting price plus existing account amount equals to the difference needed i can formulate the equation (Initial Savings)+(Total Earning)-Php Amount=. Plugging into our values here becomes: Php 400+(275+200)-x .This simplifies down furthermore to .

When you take away 275 from 400 it leaves 125 as your difference or remaining amount needed. Add these amounts together annabeles original investment was ($125)+($80)=$205 but she received another income add this too! Subtracting both results tells us Annabell needs ((400)-$(205+$275)). Your result here when calculating everything works out to $(400)-($(205+$275))=$(-$480). As negative values can not exist within our calculations we know our equation actually reads;((x-(205+(y-$275)))=-$480), if y represents annual bonus payments earned beforehand since no mention of them exists.. We find what value x takes such that above formula equates true while keeping intact its components & conditions using basic algebra rules... By simply solving either side through algebraic simplifications one arrives upon -(480)/(205-(x/2)); thus finding 'X', equalising said statement henceforth yielding (-2)(205--480);which implies X=(~$-2*205)--~$2*$480\u2248~198$.
