Since no other details about further spending are provided, we assume everything else but mentioned expenditures ($11) came out of Andrea\u2019s initial funds including saving. Hence, it can only mean Andrea initially set aside these same values as potential savings alongside whatever remains post transactions/expenses. Essentially implying Andrea began setting apart original sums equivalent both explicitly listed purchases plus subsequent residue balance until zeroing financial status again.

Thus, answering the question about 'how much did Andrea save', would mean considering everything Andrea didn't spend/keep back so this amounts to both when calculating things like savings but also if you consider any losses over time due factors such as inflation etc., thus not just based off initial available funds alone(in its most simplified form).

Nonetheless, we can still solve based purely upon factual information provided i.e., without any ambiguous implications about familial transactions beyond monetary matters concerning purchases. Hence presuming every mention pertains exclusively to pecuniary exchanges allows further simplification thus focusing solely on financial components involved explicitly throughout narrated event sequences while neglecting potential implicit references involving non-financial realms/domains like kinship dynamics potentially relevant but presently unspecified due to absence from explicit mentions within question statements themselves.) To begin our analysis process sequentially using methodical deductive reasoning techniques following guidelines found effective generally applied across numerous mathematical domains\u2014especially those dealing predominantly with arithmetic problems--start off by determining what amounts specifically relating directly influence available capital changes through both incoming sums ('money being saved') alongside corresponding expenditures (-spending), such quantities often serve as foundation elements forming essential constituents integral parts formulating overall totals calculation expressions necessary henceforth performing required operations subsequently leading toward desired outcome identifying particular remaining figure(n) post applying defined procedures according previously established orderings thereby enabling precise computation results sought forthwith fulfillment ensuring completion task successfully achieved once calculated result align perfectly corresponds precisely target quantity expected outcomes initially predetermined set benchmark targets defining specific requirements seeking satisfying these exact demands conclusively validating correct computations conducted accurately reflect accurate actual scenarios under consideration scrutinized closely detail level examination providing meticulously crafted analyses covering all critical aspects necessitated ensure holistic understanding complete comprehensive grasp over subject matter allowing informed decisions making facilitation appropriate action planning implementation accordingly adaptability versatile approaches utilizing diverse strategies complementarities optimizations maximize effectiveness efficiency fully exploiting resources capabilities benefits minimize costs losses enhance productivity fostering sustainable growth development long term profitable venture establishment continuous learning improvement personal career progression lifelong skill acquisitions beneficial contributions valuable societal significance promoting inclusive prosperity equitable opportunity accessibility rightful justice fairness principles ethics moral code conduct ground rules govern behavior interactions relationships society function harmonious",
        " Besides spending $11 on herself (for clothes), we know that she also returned home four times larger amounts than the price paid ($11) as gifts; i.e., these other three trips cost \\(11 \\times 4 = {44}\\) units. Add up all costs involved during this shopping trip, which means subtracting them from the original sum of savings. That can only mean deducting both purchases (\\${11} and ${44}) totalling $({55})\\space$ used altogether through buying those items plus returning back",

Subtract the sum identified earlier ($15) which represents what was used out of initial saving i.e., Find difference [$36-(sum)$]=$36-$15=>This equals $21 remaining savings post shopping. This shows us whatever addition value she didn't spend during buying goods thus concluding the unspent part equaling accumulated savings implies preexisting balance before purchases equated towards potential 'saved'.

        " We need to calculate this based on what we know was not used or given away before getting into specific transactions (the buying of a $11 shirt). To find out if there\u2019s anything missing here, let\u2019s identify all financial changes mentioned within the scenario itself, assuming no other expenses took place outside of those directly described. Firstly, add back the cost of the item purchased later ($11) because it wasn\u2019t part of the original sum which indicates saving\u2014so you would get $36+$11=$47 This implies that either nothing else went wrong or additional income came up post purchases since these calculations don\u2019t yield any savings but rather show higher spending leading to zero balance.

Find out how much Andreana kept as savings subtract expenses from initial amounts available To find out if Samantha passed all three tests with no errors, we need to add up the maximum possible scores and ensure it equals or exceeds 10 points per test multiplied by 3 times. Since one error costs half point reduction every time, let\u2019s denote n as the minimum integer value such that \\( \\frac{1}{n} \\) represents our effective score factor due to penalties when dividing by 'ErrorFactor'.
