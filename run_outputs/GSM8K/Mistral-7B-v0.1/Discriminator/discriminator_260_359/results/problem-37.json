To find out whether he hit it right away consider first subtracting all quantities accounted till specific dates so far excluding whatever might have remained yet untouchable beyond said period namely Saturday because no further information about additional figures posted post midweek comes across thus leading towards assumption conclusion point reached near current timeline unless alterations take place subsequently affective future projections/scenarios impeding accuracy prior knowledge inputs used initially intended use purpose fulfilled up until present moment captured visually presented graphically mathematically computed resulting values derived solely utilizing logical deductions drawn strictly relying purely factual numerical evidence available preliminarily assessed undergoes analytical scrutiny thereby assessment determining exact status achieved reaching conclusions accordingly expressed plainly summarised succinct manner without unnecessary complexity avoid ambiguity simplifying concept understanding enhances clarification effectiveness overall maintain consistency throughout while preserving integrity objective truth represented herewith ensuring transparency maintained amongst parties involved keeping open channels communication promotes dialogue fostering mutual respect trust establishing positive relational dynamics moving forward constructively progress toward shared goals collectively working together accomplishments attained building stronger foundations solidified relationships enhanced efficiency increased productivity results yield optimum potential fully harness capabilities leveraged opportunities exploited challenges addressed effectively providing necessary feedback facilitating continuous improvement benefiting society holistic advancement individual growth alike comprehensive system development ultimately sustainability preserved perpetuated legacy carried forth creating lasting impact shaping world history defining era influencing generations leaving indelible mark changing lives transformative force propelling civilization evolution paving pathways human race destined follow inspiring others strive achieve excellence aspire great heights reach dreams realise wishes desire turn fantasies reality create wonders amazement astonishment joy content satisfaction happiness peace harmony unity hope faith courage love acceptance kindness compassion empathy tolerance forgiveness mercy justice equality liberty freedom rights dignity self esteem confidence leadership vision innovation ingenuity creativity imagination pers",
        " second part of this question without having to identify what happened before because it doesn\u2019t affect our calculations; however, as stated initially, let us first determine all sales made during active business hours throughout that particular working week except Mondays since those were nonworking ones (Monday through Sunday excluding only one full business day \u2013 so effectively four). That would mean summing up values listed within individual transactions carried out every respective operational day including any others not mentioned yet but which could occur independently outside office operations such perhaps due personal consumption etc., therefore calculating simply taking away results cumulatively derived based upon provided information relating directly towards actual numbers obtained via arithmetic sums calculated separately regarding both sides(left & right) involved thereby allowing calculation procedures leading eventually obtaining exact figures representing intended outcome once computed accordingly while keeping track carefully ensuring accuracy especially when making comparisons against initial estimated targets set forth earlier itself concerning overall desired goals subsequently used later also determining resultant percentages if needed along similar lines pertaining quantitative evaluations conducted henceforth depending solely exclusively dependent mainly wholly originated according strictly internal account balance sheets whether localized or dispersed amongst various distinct entities comprising larger corporate structures likewise extending further into broader spectrum domains potentially involving wider range geographical locations among numerous related factors collectively taken together yielding substantial amount conclusions resulting specifically correlated primarily centered mostly around specific topics/subject matter areas linked closely interconnected intricately shared connections often featuring highly integrated elements operating alongside complementary functions performing critical roles integral essential components serving vital purposes crucial foundational bases established solidifying core infrastructural frameworks fundamental building blocks necessary construct establishing secure effective reliable structurally stable dependable sound strategies promoting favorably conducive beneficial conditions ultimately facilitating optimal performance optimum efficiency producing maximum productivity fostering prosperity encouraging sustainability maintaining wellbeing enhancing quality improving standard elevating standards advancing progress strengthening society empowering citizens creating better opportunities nurturing growth catalyst stimulating innovation driving transformative change sparkling inspiration energizing enthusiasm lifting spirits uplifting hearts motivating minds fueling passion stirring curiosity igniting imagination inciting creativity unleashing potential propelling development triggering evolution pushing boundaries expanding horizons stretching limits exceed expectations surpass obstacles breaking barriers conquering challenges vanquishing fears facing adversaries battling problems resolving conflicts solving puzzles tackling issues addressing concerns",
        " one whole week (i.e., including Sunday). We know this because it says 'in a week'. But since he missed out Monday as well which means excluding Sundays too when calculating sales towards meeting his goal leaves us only six operating days instead of seven. Thus consider these four working days alongwith three non-working ones(Monday & friday) making up entirety i.e., all or seventh(!)=seven operationable workdays.(Wknd=+x)(Tue=y), ... ,Thu=(x\u22122),(Fri)=(x\u22121); therefore,(Weekends cumulative)+ [(total desired)-((weekly subtractions))] Hence ((12+(20))-(15+(12+(18))))crates; finally equals (+11 )-[3<<--->]/(----------)or (-7/\u2013\u2013>)which equalls (-7/-7)*10=-1*10=>Negative eleven (=|-+\u2192>>---//-->>\u2014<-)->One!

        " over the weekend. From Tuesday to Thursday (which counts as three operational business days), he sold 15 + 12 + 18 = 45 crates. That adds up to 20 + 45 = 65 crates so far this week. His original target was 120 crates but he missed one workday due to closure which would equal another quarter or approximately 30 crates considering even distribution across all seven working days ((120/7)*(number of closures)). Hence before any adjustments based upon sales we could subtract those uncounted 'normal operations'. Therefore if you consider normal operation rate against actual it works out thusly; taking into account only four regular operating days instead of eight results in daily sale rates being calculated using these figures only \u2014 [(total nonoperational cash intake) / existing standardized forecasts]. Thus calculation goes like: [((120+cities))*(1/5)]-(daily average earnings). We can solve for cities assuming city stands insulnarily opposite meaning not affected hence remains constant through entire duration under consideration i.e., throughout whole period until point when further evaluation takes place \u2013 therefore let us fix value around initial benchmark provided during assessment viz.; say ten units per session equate roughly about 5 sessions times yield amount multiplied equally representing quantity expected forthcoming events happening sequentially rather simultaneously without overlap such trends observed repeatedly within similar context yet differing parameters herein present namely scope variability attributed factors including market forces economic behaviors competitive dynamics etc resulting varying magnitude impact degree severity frequency occurrences correlations causation effect probability chance outcome possibility uncertainty certainty reliance trust mutual understanding respect fairness honesty integrity justice equality liberty dignity freedom rights responsibility stewardship governance leadership inspiration motivation innovation creativity courage bravery persistence determination resolve resilience adaptability agility flexibility responsiveness communication collaboration teamwork cooperation networking connections relationships community support solidarity unity fraternity brotherhood family friends kinship companionship bond affinity affection compassion kindness generosity hospitality tolerance patience forgiveness mercy benevolence charitable acts philanthropy goodwill humanitarianism altruism selfless sacrifice service volunteering helping helpeth assistance comfort care solace sustenance nourishment gratitude appreciation acknowledgment recognition honor reverence thanksgiving celebration festivity joy",

We also need to include these additional sellings with those made throughout the rest of the open weeks, so it becomes 45+20=65. Hence, since this amount didn't meet or exceeds his daily average based on 5 workdays; therefore our calculations won't reflect what happened exactly like if you divide current sum(i.e., 65) divided by working days i.e., four which would get us approximately 16 per active saleable/shop hour period.

Because even though these operations might result into same values mathematically but logically speaking adding them only makes sense here..
