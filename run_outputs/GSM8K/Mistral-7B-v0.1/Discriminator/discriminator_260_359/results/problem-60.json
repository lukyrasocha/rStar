Figure out how many individuals still attended as well as their genders based on those who opted not to depart during this time frame considering you mentioned earlier that 22 men stuck around meaning eighty percent or three fourths decided against leaving\u2014and applying said logic accordingly yields twenty years old subtracting twelve from forty resulting nineteen remaining participants afterwards ten minus seven indicates thirty stayers keeping all original gender count intact while seventeen fled thus eighteen guys persisted counting up fifteen ladies hence adding together results we deduce",

Since no information about female departure was mentioned directly or indirectly within our scenario let us assume nobody among females exits hence all fifteen remain untouched post recalibration .

However since no further details regarding gender ratio amongst those who remain can\u2019t help determine any specific breakdown but just consider even distribution scenario out of their respective genders as per original data provided earlier about attendance numbers prior starting off discussion\u2026 That means half would likely equalize towards both categories being represented equally resulting onto twelve survivors including eight ladies hence seven minus initial count representing loss through departure equates eleven leaving twenty plus eighteen standing collectively constituting thirty once again matching up perfectly alongside restoring equality beforehand!

And as we know only 22 out of 25 men (or roughly approximately eight man per group) remained which would mean around four groups remaining i.e., half being leaved, so this confirms our assumption about fractionation among genders equaling equally or having almost same ratio when comparing initial count vs what was found later during midpoint mark etc.. That implies Women too depart three times less frequently than Men making their reduced presence twice minor compared against actual diminution rate exhibited earlier based upon observed male figures retaining status quo whereas female demographic decreased nearly thrice faster following established guideline(one quarter reduction irrespective distributional pattern).
