To find out the additional quantity John handed over was equivalent to 2 parts (since it was twice what he purchased), you divide the purchase worth into portions; thus one part becomes half the original count which means adding another 2*20=<<2*20=40>>40 marbles due to father\u2019s contribution . Add up all those quantities together, getting 20(marbles) + 40(extra)+ 50(initially present ones)= <<20+40+50=110>>110.

Since every one unit of these particular type of marbles measures half kilograms or .5Kg., this means all those marbles would equal a sum of .5*70=. But first multiply its units against it own value; you get (.5)*.5(.)5...etc.; therefore solve the equation ,(.5^n)*m,where m represents your object\u2019s initial value n represent exponentiation level..then if solving above equation using exponential notation only once yields ..this implies addition becomes multiplication while subtraction translates into division resulting net result thus simplifying process\u2026and hence calculating exactly amounts together instead trying guessing numbers! Here goes ; Using PEMDAS rule here [Parentheses Or Brackets Exponents Power Division Multiplication Addition Subtract], our original expression converts directly via distributive property : ((-.5)+(-.5))*(70)= (-.5)(-.5)= (-.25)[multiplying parentheses inside brackets ]=-0.(7), multiplied outside bracket signifies raising negatives raised power negative fractional decimals because ^ indicates taking root not squaring etc.). We can observe similar procedure elsewhere too like exponents themselves carry same meaning when combined within parenthesis but opposite meanings apply otherwise leading us towards finding specific numerical values before attempting complicated calculations involving multiple terms beyond basic operations such adding up several small fractions individually without regard having overall goal remain unchanged despite altering sequence itself causing complications arising mostly during algebra dealing sequences nested under sets rather simpler versions easier dealt through direct computation due factorization techniques employed thereby making substitution possible allowing isolation steps easily executed obtain precise answers accordingly avoid confusing results caused primarily latter methods utilized unnecessarily complexities especially considering current scenario needless intricacies may arise whilst manipulating formulas incorrectly possibly yield invalid outputs altogether potentially rendering correct solution impossible unless accurate approach taken followed suit appropriately ensuring accuracy consistently maintained across mathematical procedures applied subsequently further verification required upon completion validity guaranteed satisfactorily assured until achieved fully satisfyingly conclusively reached hopefully proving beneficial ultimately providing clarity regarding concept fundamentals addressed throughout course curriculum present study material pertaining subject matter introduced earlier already learned essential foundational concepts previously reviewed extensively reinforcing knowledge gained solidify understanding fundamental principles underlying various theories encountered examining real life applications applying logic",
