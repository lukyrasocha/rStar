Each person therefore gets six guns if shared out equally. Therefore, the correct choice as per our available options becomes : None since no such option matches the derived solution; thus leading us towards contradiction despite having arrived at the logical conclusion based off provided data inputs within established parameters. Hence when considering these choices strictly without factoring other variables might lead one into uncharted territory making it appear contradictory until carefully scrutinizing all elements involved including distribution amongst participants themselves.
