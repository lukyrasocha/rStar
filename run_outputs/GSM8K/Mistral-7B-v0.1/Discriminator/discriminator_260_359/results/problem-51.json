        " eat three eggs daily (totaling six), whereas the remaining two individuals eat two eggs per day (totalling four). Calculate the entire amount consumed within one day as follows; Six plus Four equals Ten. Therefore, ten eggs get used across all members during just one daytime period. To determine egg consumption over seven consecutive calendar days multiply your single-day calculation by Seven. Thus Eleven times Seven results into Seventy-Seven which is equal to Twenty-Fourteen when expressed numerically hence this would conclude our mathematical operation sequence because we wish to quantify these amounts using numerical figures instead of written textual representations like 'Twenty'.
