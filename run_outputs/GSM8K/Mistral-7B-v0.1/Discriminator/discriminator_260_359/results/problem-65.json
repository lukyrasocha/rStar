        " know from the prompt that senior programmers earn $400 more than junior ones who get $2000 every month. This means seniors make $2000+400=$2400 a month. Calculate the payment received collectively by both groupings annually (per employment period). It\u2019ll involve multiplying the sum obtained if calculating independently among these professionals ($) times their frequency(monthly$*no of months=annual$). First find out the overall salary collected when you compute separately; Find the aggregate contribution made during January by just the juniors. They form half (=\u00bd or .5) of the entire count therefore making them equal to (.5)*total number(*)=(.5)(100)=50 individuals*.($2000 per man/$)/Months=paycheck.(so ,their joint February receipt becomes=.5.*$.1,i.e,.junior staffers receive $(.5*$2000)$/month=(.$1000)$.

Finally multiply both results together resulting into getting approximately ~$2^4+1^6$. Thus, if you combine your calculations; You would get about~$352,000` . The exact computation was not asked but approximations weren\u2019t requested thus making these figures acceptable enough. Therefore answering simply gets rid off any decimal points so just sticking directly onto `2^4`.
