Subtracting also means subtracting another 24 'non-A' cards leaving us with only (48-24), i.e., 24 'non-A' & non-B' cards.

Having already accounting all prior letters means any leftover ones automatically carry the label as bearing 'D.'

        " B on them. Calculate the leftover amount after removing all letters except D. Subtract both counts (A & B) from the initial count: 80 - 16 - 32 equals 32 leaves us undiscovering card holder 'C'. Lastly find out what fraction these numbers represent based off the question stem using this formula \u00f7 nth root(n), Where \u2018n\u2019 stands for denominator or ratio as represented above.\r\rSo you divide the values calculated thus far which would look like so... \r1st Part; Card holders without any designated symbol --> This could be referred to your calculation below because it represents ALL VALUES but excludes specific symbols.(Card Count)/Total Number Of Cards   ==>   32/(80-(total))=32/48===> .~Fraction Represents All Values Excluding Specific Designations i..e.; Symbol ('A', 'B','D'). Hence our new equation looks even better.<|end_of_document|>->     You want me to simplify further than just calculating simple ratios if possible when trying to solve complex problems! Sure thing\u2014how about multiplying everything together first before dividing anything next time around (:). Well let us proceed since simplifying fractions through division isn't exactly necessary here anymore I suppose (- : ) Great thinking We won't need multiplication right away anyway Consider finding totals Before getting into advanced math concepts Let\u2019s begin Simple arithmetic Okay found Total Starting Value Using provided Information Final Result Found Was Your Process Clear Or Did Any Section Need Clarity Maybe break down steps visually But still following along Understandably Still Got Lost Arent Details Taking Long Time Impatience Setting Back Again Patience Needed When Dealing With Math Not Fearful Concept Must Practice Often Enhances Comprehension Keep Learning Never Stop Being Curious And Always Double Check Work To Maintain Accuracy Alright Take Care !!!!
