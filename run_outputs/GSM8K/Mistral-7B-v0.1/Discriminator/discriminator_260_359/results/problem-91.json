Since April had purchased all these amounts plus ten extra ones when planning out what was necessary, she initially went shopping buying enough items based on this amount. Initially purchasing supplies led up into four times 90 since we also need accounting for those additional batch purchase made by mistake if any; i.e., 90*4=360 units or rather quantities here.

        " we need first to calculate the total amount required for both flowers; this sum up to be 30 (for the daisies) plus 60 (for the roses), hence equals 90 pots. Since April initially purchased 100 pots, subtracting these requirements leaves us with enough space only for additional plants or supplies not specified here. Therefore, without specifying what else was contained within those original purchases, it can\u2019t quantitatively say how exactly 'left overs'. Thus assuming everything intended for the mentioned purposes went towards acquiring just flower seeds/plants etc., if nothing extra found place apart from designated use for said flowers \u2014 meaning no other uncategorized purchase included \u2013 one could simply state whatever wasn't allocated directly would technically remain available post deductions i.e., essentially equal amounts reserved but pending deployment.
