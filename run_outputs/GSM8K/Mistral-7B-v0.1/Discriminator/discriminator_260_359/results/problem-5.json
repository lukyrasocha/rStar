Since this goes over Mrs. Cruz\u2019s limit by ($409 500\u2013$400 000), it exceeds her budget by $9 500 exactly as calculated above thus concluding the initial question \u201chow much MORE\u201d wouldn\u2019t apply here considering actual purchase would exceed set aside amount precisely without margin hence no possibility exists!

Therefore, the amount exceeding Mrs. Cruz\u2019s original estimate costs about $9 ,500 .

Adding these extra costs to the initial purchase price we get $350 000 (price of home) + $59 500 (total additional cost)=$409 500 ($). Subtracting this value against Mrs. Cruz's stated maximum spending limit yields as follows; $409 500 \u2013 $400 000= $9 500 above Mariah\u2019s allocated expenditure range.

By subtracting her maximum allowed expenditure ($400 000) from our calculated value (i.e., $409 500), We can determine 'how much more?' was spent compared to Mr.Cruz\u2019s personal budget limitation as such \u2013 $409 500 minus $400 000 leaves us with $9 500 extra spending above Ms. Croszaire's desired financial restraint level!

Added together these additional expenses equal ($17500+$42000=$59500), thus bringing your overall costs to ($350000+$59500=)$409500 ). Lastly, since Ms. Cruz only wanted houses under what she could afford ($400 000), you need subtract their target value ($409500-$400 000 ) to get the difference ,which equals $(9500) above Mr Cruz\u2019s initial goal !

To find out how much it exceeds Mrs. Cruz\u2019s budget; simply subtract your initial amount ($400 000) you start with.
