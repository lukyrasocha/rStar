What is the value of unknown variable x? We know that Ralph watches TV for 4 hours a day from Monday to Friday. This means he watches TV for 4 hours * 5 days = 20 hours from Monday to Friday. On Saturdays and Sundays, he watches twice as much time, so he watches 4 hours * 2 = 8 hours each day on the weekend. Therefore, he watches TV for 8 hours * 2 days = 16 hours over the weekend.
