Since one person gets served per slice or third of a whole pizza because three persons share every serving; therefore if you want enough bread slides to make sure everybody get fed once all these calculations aside let\u2019s see...how much would six large peices cost altogether ? Well first calculate out just simple math before worry about additional considerations later like pricing factors .

To accommodate all these additional consumers without having any leftovers just imagine splitting them according unit measures like you would use when packing eggs or cutting paper circles etc instead looking at fractions makes calculations easier so if i wanted half dozen group sizes say divided twice making my new equation look similar twenty times ten plus eighteenth resulting again seventeen altogether meaning only fifteen round trips required because everyone consumes food fully thus not leaving anything behind even though others may eat smaller portions later .
