Since you can only count full cycles within this range, the resultant value here needs division instead of modulo. As such, over exactly ten 5-day periods represented as integers [i=0] through i<j<=10 {we evaluate j}, multiplied together equals one hundred; while counting upwards again represents additional halfway marks via integer pairs whose products still equal tens (e.g., [(k*6)+(l+1)%x]) when considering k representing 'fifth partial units'; since twenty intervals exist thus forming combinations like [[(n*a) + (b)] % c], yielding zero residue implies no multiplication carried further beyond whole numbers during said process).

However, since 'hand', not any specific fingers or palm parts might also expand when considering additional appendages like wings/fins etc., according to various other contextual details provided within question but these aspects weren't mentioned explicitly here; hence keeping only counting basic extremities upwards adds count towards primary body structure i.e excluding smaller secondary protrusions forming lateral flanks which may result from expanded musculature & ligaments beyond skeletal basis yet arenot directly proportional increase per unit timeframe specified.
