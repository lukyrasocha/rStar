Next, consider what happened to Braylen; initially writing up 40 stories but doubling them makes it grow to 80 new ones plus their original count: 80+40=120. Again add those numbers together so far gets you this amount when counting only these two siblings\u2019 works: 60+(another_brother or sis)=total_stories. Lastly, recalling about last kid mentioned who penned down twice as many tales making sense out perseverance \u2013 we see four figures collectively turned words into narratives hence multiply fourth member's work rate i.e.,  1*Margot(the writer)*2 yields us exactly calculated quantity once multiplied through summing previously found values would present our grand resultant volume : **Final ",

        " or you can say addition twice here like this; it\u2019s ok if your method differs so long as logic isn\u2019t compromised because I am not really interested about why exactly people approach problems differently anyway (the latter form also works when doubling larger numbers).

        " other siblings wrote as well. Add up their totals together; this gets us ((40 [for Alani] add) (+80[from writing twice what she took earlier])(++80 [from braylen having twice that who was previously assigned four times]))=  40+80+80 = 200 different types combined in both weeks plus one story per person equals twelve participants results into 24 extra contributions or writings brought about when you sum them using addition calculation rules . This yields only eight unique items/products produced during these contests overall because three writers generated no work themselves while seven contributed variously over time according due date scheduling policies enforced among groups members allowing individuals flexibility within set deadlines regarding length requirements based upon age classifying subjects matter etc..
