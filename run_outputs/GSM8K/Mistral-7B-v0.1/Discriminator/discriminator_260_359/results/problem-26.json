        " coins. Total quantity of coins (quarters) = 5*quarter_value=total(coins)=sum([quantity(k)*quarter_value(i)])[]. Given that the question involves multiplication (`for k in range(num):`), this expression could not translate into Python directly as written but would work if properly defined within valid loops or array comprehension context; here `itertools.product` usage seems incorrect since it generates Cartesian products rather than direct multiplications necessary for such summation tasks). Instead, summing them separately yields: Value of quarters = num_quarters * 25 = 5 * 25 = 125 cents; Value of dimes = num_dimes * 10 = 2 * 10 = 20 cents. Therefore, Kelly possesses a combined monetary value equaling their summed individual values which equals calc<<125+20>> = 145 cents.
