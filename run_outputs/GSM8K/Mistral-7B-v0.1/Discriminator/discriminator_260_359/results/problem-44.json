Substitute these variables accordingly ; thus substituting them yields us w=$10*(5)+($300)/4 or further simplifying would yield W=$50+$75 which ends up being $$125 as a result.

All adding up together leads us therefore conclude with  2000+600=($2600), thus making him get earned during these few months equaling around or nearly about $.",
