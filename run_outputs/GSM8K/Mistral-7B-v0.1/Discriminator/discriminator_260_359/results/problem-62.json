Therefore, both Jam and Meg collectively require exactly six boxes based off this estimation using assumption made about practicality constraints around dealing items individually not being divisible under normal circumstances unlike abstract mathematics representation thus resulting them having same quantity when considered together regardless what initial condition represents separately before combined effort analysis undertaken leading us to conclusion.

To figure out this value we would typically divide 72/number_of_pencils_per_box but since you haven\u2019t specified such thing lets consider every box capable of holding any quantity less than or equal to those mentioned earlier so effectively dividing 72 amongst as many units necessary without exceeding limits described beforehand(in practice though these scenarios involve logistics beyond pure arithmetic hence lack precise solution due to my constraints).
