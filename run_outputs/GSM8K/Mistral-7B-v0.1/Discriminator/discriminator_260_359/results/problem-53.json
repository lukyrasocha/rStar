Since this time also marked the point where the population was halved compared to its present value due to being only half of Cera's current ages, we know their ratio corresponds to twice the earlier mentioned figure i.e., 6 years ago, the populations correspondence would've equated likewise; if so, presently assuming China's growth remains linear over said period can simply take away these numbers considering both variables doubled every year, therefore deducting them accordingly which leaves us having roughly figured out currently about fourteen thousand something odd hundred billion twelve zero seventy million plus or minus eight twenty six thousands people residing within Chinese borders since multiplication factor considered buttresses those respective digits quite literally doubling around our calculation.",
        " twice whatever it currently is because six years ago it was half its current size. Therefore, if this past population (let\u2019s call P) equals three thousand multiplied by noah's age back then (P = 23x3000), we get that P=69000. To find out the present population (let's say N), which is double any previous population would yield; therefore according to your problem statement N=2P implies our nation's contemporary populace equates to twice the historical count or equivalently calculates into(N=2*P). Hence substituting our prior established value yields us having Pop_nation=(2*69,000)= 138,000 individuals presently residing within these borders.[[INCORRECT]]] Accordingly corrected analysis indicates Population_now equals calculated product amount henceforth rendered into Latin numerals signified via 'M' representing one hundred and eighty thousands i.e., MHLDDXX ([MANAGEMENT ALERT]: This numerical estimation may potentially exert pressure upon resources including housing accommodations among other communal amenities thereby prompting administrators considerate reflection towards strategic urban planning measures.]",
