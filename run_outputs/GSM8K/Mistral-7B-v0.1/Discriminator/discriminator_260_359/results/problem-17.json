Thus we know if all pits/holes required equal times Matthew could complete them using specific patterns such as SSSTTSSTTTT...for example. However since these particular tasks demand different durations one cannot simplify or use equivalent measures like liters per gallon etc., thus calculating separately according their own individual rates yields us best solution!

Hence , if you wanted all thirty twenty shallow versions made using my example process above I\u2019d suggest just taking your initial count down about fifteen percent because every seventh iteration involves removing rather than adding new stuff thereby increasing overall work rate slightly compared against its counterpart but definitely not quite enough since doing things efficiently doesn \u2019t matter most when dealing directly w/ quantity vs quality factors involved here either).
