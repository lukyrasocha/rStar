Note however that this calculation assumes one can travel directly without stopping or changing routes en route. Furthermore it considers no deviations such as rest breaks etc., making these numbers purely hypothetical but not entirely realistic based upon actual conditions present while driving long distances like across states/countries. Still though; according to those assumptions... yes indeed! It comes down pretty close to precisely what was asked about here :) ",
