Let\u2019s assume Richard gets R cherries; since the prompt tells us that Robert has ten more than him, I can conclude that Robert receives R+10 cherries. We also know that Robert received exactly half of all sixteen pizzas or one third fewer which comes out as being equivalent numbers because when you find three quarters of any whole group/number(like our twelve slices) ,you get four even halves . Therefore , using this reasoning methodology ,we come up with these equations :   Richard=R &    Robert=Ro=r+10 Cherry_Total=(R+Ro)=R+(RO)+30=------since RO means robert own son who loves playing guitar! And Ro represents something else other related only slightly but still linked like maybe mother whose name contains 'o')  Solving this system algebraically yields r value of twenty while putting those values back into your original setup confirms my solution thus concluding ;robert actually possesses forty fruits above jerrys count !!
