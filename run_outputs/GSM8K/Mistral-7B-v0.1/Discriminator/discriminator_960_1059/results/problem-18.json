Since we need just information about reduction compared to original amount here, negative percent indicates decrease while positive means increased over time period specified as 'compared'. Negative numbers imply lesser amounts; hence used before numerical values when denoting deficit conditions like financial losses etc., thus indicating drop not growth. Subtracting these figures yields $(40) representing savings made thanks partly due perhaps owning own vehicle instead buying one elsewhere(in case purchasing another automobile could result higher expenses), however also considering factors such taxes applicable upon purchase which might reduce affordability further still despite initial discount seen earlier without taking extra fees into account entirely yet including possible hidden costs attached towards ownership maintenance & repairs post acquiring said asset too!
