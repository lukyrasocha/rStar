        " both would equal twice as many Carlton\u2019s because adding those values equals seven times as big or doubled it! We know Carlton's size was given beforehand; so let us first find out which amount their difference represents, i.e., what you get when multiplying its sides together \u2013 thus multiply them sidewise (left \u00d7 right). When doing multiplication/multiplications using addition such rules help better understand fractions quickly since all numbers work well but also make things less confusing overall too especially when dealing directly w/ integers without extra steps involved etc..
