Since we can assume one standardized size unit \u2013 let's call it a single piece per box without mixing sizes here since no mixed measurements were initially provided in your information setup \u2013 dividing would provide us insight only under these simplified assumptions. However, realistically speaking, especially within commercial contexts concerning physical products denoted explicitly as packaged commodities, discrepancies often include individual item counts not neatly aligning perfectly upon division leading back to our consideration about handling mixed amounts properly.

Together as one unit \u2014 when everyone finished their jobs\u2014they sold 64 bar(s). Dividing into equal parts such units shows them both having only sold once; no further breakdown needed. Thus working backwards simply requires dividing evenly among themselves twice here -- which happens easily because our numbers happen already divided down perfectly within multiples suitable for halves . One way could yield sixteen per part while using zero remainders during division either option confirms its correctness if you wish extra assurance/cross checking results back yourself later !

Since these 8 boxes contain altogether 64 chocolate bars, we can find out how many chocolate bars are contained within one box by dividing 64 (the total) by 8 (total number of boxes). This results into sixteen ((64/8=16)) chocolate bars per box. Therefore, if you break it down, every single individual bar represents exactly .1 or 1/10th (.1*10) of any full box.

        " (or 3.5) times eight which equals 28 Chocolate Bars; meanwhile, Peter also sold almost identical amount i.e., about one quarter less than what Lisa sold because four minus three point fifty divided by sixteen(the quantity difference due totwo people),which resultsin approximately thirtyfive points seventytwo chocolate bars.

Therefore (Peter+ Lise)=(36+(24) =60), this means it equals the amount we expected i.e., if you sell one box ,the outcome would not change even when its split into halves so our assumption was right but let\u2019s try another approach as well suppose only Lisa or Peter can make transactions .

        " problem statement relevant to solving it. We also know that Peter sold four (not eight) point fifty or rather approximately 4.5 units/boxes equivalent(i mean we can assume here because if not peter would clearly mention). Thus Pete sold about 4*12=<<4*12=48>>48 barries approx.. To get backward this approach you just multiply your approximate results instead of dividing like mentioned earlier.<|end_of_solution|> I apologize for the confusion in my previous messages; allow me to provide accurate calculations based strictly on direct arithmetic without estimation.",
        " Lisa; here we know exactly about quantity which was sold as well as it tells us what units those quantities belong too (boxes). We need such info because later we shall apply multiplication using this specific figure value(i.e., `3.5`) along wth another known unit (hence \u2013 \u201cboxes\u201d) into its appropriate math operation (`*`). Moreover since all other numerical data provided regarding sales figures pertain only towards one side\u2019of equation being solved i.. let`us first start off solving problem based on numbers associated exclusively with said condition before progressing onto others listed below thematically related but differing slightly contextually speaking thus allowing ample clarity when executing any relevant formulas required while carrying out our primary calculation task ahead!
