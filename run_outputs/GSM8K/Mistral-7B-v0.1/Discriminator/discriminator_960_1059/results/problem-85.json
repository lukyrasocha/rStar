It also tells us that $(a + a + 80) represents half as much again per week compared to when all members go together. Therefore, if both groups went every other Saturday, multiplying the latter figure by four would yield six Saturdays worth plus Thursdays equaling eight times their individual contributions over these seven weeks equals the group sum; thus thrice that value equates full time contribution i.e., \u2018four times X plus two halves,\u2019 or simply \u2018five times.\u2019 Consequently:   3(X*((n/m)-1))=FV    3[X+(p^q)*((n/(mn)^b))]   Fixed variable expressions denote numerical placeholders hereinwhere `P` stands denoting quantity shared among partners who attend collectively but opt individually thereby diminishing fiscal demands whilst sustaining communal benefitsand yet maintain cost efficiencies via split fees amongst cooperation factions\u2013resultant savings may range depending upon member count inclusive financial constraints imposedthereupon respective institutions dictate requisite expenditure reductions accordinglyproportionality governs economic distribution within social collaborations promoting efficiency through informed participation ensuring optimal resource allocation balancing personal benefit against collective interestwithout compromising either party nor alliance integrityessential component fostering egalitarian accessibility upholding societal welfare imperatives amidst prevailing scarcities necessitating innovative adaptationstrategies facilitating unprecedented progress while minimizing inherent disparities perpetuatedhistorically under capitalistic paradigms emphasizing competition versus collaborationforemost tenets espoused modern organizational ethos champion advocacy initiatives empower marginalized populations disenfranchised traditional power structures excluding wholesale adoptionof western hegemonic ideologiesadvocating diversification enrichment across socioeconomic landscapes embracing global interconnectedness cultivating inclusion harmony universality acknowledging indigenous wisdom integrating cultural nuances augmenting comprehension crosscultural communication transparency fortifying trust relationships establish foundations construct future generations bridges unity tolerance peace diplomatic endeavors nurture symbiotic prosperity complementary development hol",
