Determine what percentage this represents towards the target price ($\\frac{Total\\ Earnings}{Target Price}*\\frac{Percent\\ Complete}{1}=\\frac{$1000}{$10,000}\\cdot 100\\%$). Solve it. It indicates that she saves about $\\frac{$1000}{$10,000}\\cdot 100\\%=10\\%$ every single week of saving alone which means if our calculation correct we could conclude its not possible since she needs to reach only \\textbf{$\\frac{1}{\\text{total percent}}$.

Once calculated it equals \\(200 + 600\\) which comes together equaling `$800` earned every one working week. Next you want to know what percentage represents so lets remember percent means parts divided by whole multiplied times hundred \\[percent=\\frac{parts}{whole} \\times 100\\]So here if janet wishes to set aside `$\\pi$/`for the entirety of owning said automobile; calculating [`'\\frac{$10000*(20)}{100}'`, simplified becomes `\\(\\frac{$2000}$`).

When considering 40 hours worked in a single seven-day week, multiply your rate times twenty four i.e., ($25 /hr)*(24 hr) which totals approximately $$600/week . Divide your goal into manageable portions. Knowing you desire saving funds over several months or years can make longterm goals seem less daunting , however sometimes breaking them down monthly helps visualise progress. Monthly contribution based on desired timeline; since calculating annually provides us annual perspective lets calculate first ; divide yearly sum($2000), desiring savings period,(let\u2019s take one year)-$2000/$200=10$. Therefore if calculated according percentage basis(%)/year\u224810%=8.3 %.
