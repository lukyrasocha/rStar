Therefore, after deducting these costs from her gross salary ($15-$9), we find that she actually makes $15 -$9= $6 net income throughout the duration of serving as a juror. To calculate what her hourly rate would thus become after considering her deductions, we divide her earned amount during service i.e., $6, by all those working hrs i.e., 18 hr; therefore  6/18=$ $1/hour can be concluded. Hence the answer is : $1 /hr.",

Melissa gets paid 15 dollars per day; since the service lasted 3 days, it means she earned a total of 15 * 3 = 45 dollars including everything (salary plus parking). However, only considering her salary excluding parking cost would mean she made earnings equalling to 15*3 - 3*(the daily costs) i.e.,  45 - 9*3=45 - 27=18 dollars netting out all other miscellaneous income or deductions not mentioned here(such taxes if any.) Lastly, we divide those remaining 18$ earned value equally across all productive workdays/hours meaning per successful business minute worked amount comes down to exactly half their previous full rate because no additional charges nor benefits aside from base wages & utilities fees are involved except regular employment payment schemes usually observed under standard market conditions worldwide without exceptions making our formula look like simply : [Base Pay \u2013 Fixed Expenses] / Total Work Hour equals Net Per Hour Earnings .

Consider variables such as possible speeds affect factors like distance (d), rate (r) and time (t). Firstly according to basic formula we know `distance equals to rate times time` or mathematically represented as follows `[d=rt]`. Secondly let us break down our problem into simpler terms; Let 'x' represents minutes taken while biking hence, Walking takes `half of x`, so `(x/2)` which essentially means lesser value against same amount of work(biking here); As no other constraints mentioned therefore I assumed linearity throughout tasks i.e., maintain constant rates irrespective any external factors influencing overall efficiency during task completion process thereby simplifying equation solving mechanism considerably ; Given these conditions assume normalize scenario : Assume \u2018B\u2019 denotes Bike Time & \u2019W\u2019 walks corresponding equations derived post substitution above becomes `'w=(1/2)*bt'` OR equivalently , Rewritable version being \"`rate_of_walking*(time)/2 = rate_of_riding*bikeTime`.

Subtracting these numbers shows you earned net income of ($60-$3)*3=$165 over course of three working days. Calculate earnings rates divided by amounts spent during waking periods . Because we know she works only 6 hrs/day we divide all remaining daily earnings $(165)-(Cost)($45)/$6hr*3days; $.83/hour..

Over three days, this would add up to $12/day*$3days=$<<12*3=36>>36 earned minus what was paid out as taxes or contributions etc., so overall it\u2019s just straight cash (assuming no deductions).
