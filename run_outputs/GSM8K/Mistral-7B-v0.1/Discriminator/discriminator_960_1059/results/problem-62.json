        " problem also mentions Teresa sells them for three times their regular price; thus Large Stuffy Animal Price (LSP) would equal Small Stuffing Animal Price (SSAP)*three which results LSP= 3*$4 or $12 per unit. This means when buying one large stuffed animal it equals purchasing four smaller versions since its worth thrice what you\u2019d pay upfront. Accordingly calculate earnings derived from big and little kindies combined. As we know Total Sales (TS)=$120. Also deduce ratio mentioned like \u201ctwice\u201d. It says Twice as Many Smalls Sold implies if N represents no., X denotes Big Animals. And Y signifies Little creatures Hence TS=(X*N)+(Y*(N/X)). Insert respective figures hence ($120 = (Big_Animals*$12)+($4*(Small_stuffied_animal count)/Bigger Kindie Count)) Simplifying further $(120=$ BA.$12+SA/$BA). Multiplying both sides across yields SA=$(BC*$BS)^(-1)$-$BB$. By using substitution technique put all known values into this formula finally find SAname value so far stated $.((NS*SBE^-NB)-AA)$.

Let S represent the amount spent on small stuffed animals; therefore L represents the expenditure on Large Stuffed Animals \u2014 meaning SL equals R minus S because revenues less individual prices yield overall profit made hence $$SL+Sp=$R$.

Replacing second part inside brackets we get :   4S+24L=$120 But since S=2L , replace first equation into this new formula we receive       $$4*(2L)+24l=\\$120$$ Which leads us back to initial condition about ratio btween big and little amonuments which means everytime you multiply quantity bigger item buying than smaller buyers doubled its qty when u substitute them both equations become identical hence having same numbers.$$4*(2L)=12l => L_qty={120\\over{4*.3}}=10$.

Let \\( L \\) represent the number of large stuffed animals sold, and let \\( S \\) represent the number of small stuffed animals sold. From the textbook level explanation above, it\u2019s clear that one needs to consider variables like Price Ratio (\\( \\frac{\\text{Price}(L)}{\\text{Price}(S)} \\)), Quantity Relationship (\\( QR_{LS} = \\frac{S}{L} \\)), Sales Earnings (\\( SE = P_{L}L + P_{S}S \\)), Unit Prices Given \\(\\text{(USG\\_LS}_{LR}, USG\\_SL),\\) and Final Calculation Procedure using Equations Like Below:\\begin{align*}&\\;\\;SE &= TPE \\\\ &\\;P_{L}\\cdot L+\\left[P_{S}\\cdot S\\right]&=TPE\\\\&L\\,and\\,\\,S\\;are\\;numbers,\\quadSPU_{",
        " which means it would cost 3*4 = $12 per unit. Given Teresa sold half as many big dollars (large stuffed animals) than little ones ($4), we can set up an equation like this :   Let 'x' represent the units of large stuffed animals; Therefore,  x+2(x)=total quantity Sold ; But according to question , if y represents Little Units/small Stuffed Animals ;then their relationship could also be represented mathematically using algebra =>y= [Total Sales / Selling Price] or    Here Total sales=$120   Large Dollars sold:$12     Small Dollars sold:$4 . Substituting all known values into our initial formula yields the following linear system based upon both relationships above :-                        Unit Count Relationship              x      +      2*(x)           Equals         ???          ..

Therefore, $12*y (the amount of money earned from the sale of big stuffed animals) plus $4*x (the amount of money earned from the sale of little stuffed animals), which equals $120 according to this equation [$12*(2n)=$120 & $4*(2n)+(original value= n)] simplifies down to 12*2n+$4*2n=$120 or even further simplified into just ($24+($4)*(twice any positive integer))-$120=0 We subtract all constants except the variables\u2019 coefficients while isolating them so it becomes easier when solving algebraically ([just change \u201c$-120\u201d part]).

        " sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, if we let L represent the number of large stuffed animals she sold, then (L/2) represents the number of small stuffed animals she sold because it was half or (1/2). Thus their combined earnings can be calculated using the following expression: Total Earnings=(Large Animal Sales+Small Ananimal Sales)=(Price of Large Stuff*Number Sold)+Price of Small Stuff*(number)*= ((L*price_largeStuffedAnimal)+((L/2)*pricesmallstuff))=$120 Solving this equation yields L = 10 which means Teresa sold ten larger stuffed animals (and thus twenty smaller ones since Twice As Many than fifteen equate into Thirty), but remember what you asked; 'howmanysmall'. Therefore ,the answer is : thirty. Remembering back here all variables used pertain only when evaluating quantities not prices .

Thus, if one small stuffed animal was priced at '$x', it would mean 'large_stuffed_animal_price= 3*$x'; this means when compared against any value related to the latter type, their comparison could also be defined; eg., comparing them based on units makes sense too! Here comes our trickery point--it turns into simple multiplication instead since every item mentioned here belongs either entirely within itself or across all items listed together but individually held constant through variables assigned only once per category).
