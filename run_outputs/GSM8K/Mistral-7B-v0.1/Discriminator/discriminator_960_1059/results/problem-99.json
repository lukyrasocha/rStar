This means one complete round using all three meals would take ((180 / 60)= 3)/days or every third day since we need both morning and afternoon feedings. Given this rate, therefore, if imma purchased 720g worth of kibble; this amount could cover exactly four rounds because (720 divided by 180 equals 4). Therefore, this quantity can easily serve eight sets of daily consumption. Thus making them able enough till tomorrow! The answer is: 8.",
