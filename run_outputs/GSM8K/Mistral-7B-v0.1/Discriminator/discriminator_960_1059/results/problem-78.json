Secondly add opportunity cost losses connected just with nonworking times; here we consider mentioned initial annual wage ($25,000$) subtracted from higher pay due upon completion ($75,000$).

That means everyyear since he graduated without starting paying back until all debt was paid off or equaled out against future salaries earned (whichever happened first). To calculate this we divide upfront costs minus what can currently afford which comes down too jim making 225/((100 /(4x225))+(225) )= almost twice three full cycles around...so essentially about seven complete work years needed under these assumptions if considering only direct calculation logic rather than real life circumstances surrounding such situations etc..

However even though this scenario seems plausible considering only salary factors \u2013there remains other things like social security tax contributions which haven\u00b4t been factored into any calculations here yet! Therefore although still feasible under certain conditions such financial considerations could potentially reduce returns significantly due omitted costs involved . And therefore again underscoring why its important always thoroughly research career paths when planning future plans especially ones involving investment time frames etc..

Thus it would take (in excess) six full cycles of work/college(totaling ten quarters or about seven nines worth)(since one cycle lasts only three years we need another quarter of the period). Each extra career term being paid as above brings us exactly back into balance $((($600,000 / ($600,000))/$600,000)=one), meaning you find yourself precisely even again right when completing your fourth decade .

This leaves us calculating just about four quarter periods or perhaps less since half quarters might also help reduce our calculation error substantially.(Quarter means dividing something equally among fourth parts).
