To find out the expression involving all variables use evaluate(),evaluate(). Here we just need their count hence simplify() is not required. First let us define our symbols representing different stick colors like Red Sticks = R, Blue Sticks > B & Yellow Sticks >= K. Given conditions translate into mathematical expressions: |R| =  9 since 'there are exactly X amount', similarly when said 'exactly 5 MORE,' meaning add or subtract accordingly; thus B = P + 5 based on equation `B = F + 5`; here F stands for 'Five More.' Similarly replace k --> (k)=<K&Y~M because 'their quantity exceeds/is greater Than'. Hence these equations become:     rstickCount = abs(r).value();    secondStickCount = firstStickCount + constant(5); thirdStickCount <= mathOperator('Maximum')(-constant(3),secondStickCount); Sum_of_all_sticks = rstickCount + secondStickCount + thirdStickCount Finally combine everything under one statement return evalUtil.simplifyExpression({\"Red\":firstStickCount,\"Blue\":secondStickCount,\"Yellow\":thirdStickCount,\"Total Number Of All Colors Together\":\"Sum\"}):```pythondef solve",
