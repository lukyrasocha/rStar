Next identify monetary outflow represented here through the action \u2018gave.\u2019 Here three transactions occur \u2013 \u201c$x\u201d denotes quantity while \"$y\" stands for units cost; hence calculate individual costs per event using multiplication operation yield results below table column 'Money Spent'.
