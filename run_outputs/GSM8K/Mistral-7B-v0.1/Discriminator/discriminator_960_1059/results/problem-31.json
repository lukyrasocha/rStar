Since this happened halfway through its orbit (every 37.5 years), we can find out how long ago that was by subtracting it from their current ages: 90/37.5-30 equals approximately 11 years into the past. Therefore, Bill would also have seen the comet around ten plus one year earlier since Comet Halley only appears once per decade according to your scenario--making him roughly eleven backward if you factor our decimal place errors. Finally round off because humans don\u2019t measure time like compound interest, leading us rightfully down the path towards the expected conclusion\u2013Bill sees the Comet about  8yrs before seeing full lifecycle completion which happens biennially meaning BILL WAS EIGHT YEAR OLD WHEN HE SEEN THE FIRST COMET!

Firstly, since it takes Comet Halley approximately one orbit around the Sun (which equals seventy-five Earth years) to return to its last sighting, Bill would observe the event only once during those seven fifty odd years if any year falls within them--but according to our problem statement 'a second time'. This implies another round trip occurred recently while neither observer lived through their previous trips together anymore! Therefore; At least forty years passed without observing either man witness again until present moment(when Bill returned home). As such both individuals aged alongwith space exploration efforts over these decades before reconnecting via telescope viewings etc., hence making themselves available opportunities back onto earth which could allow further examination regarding prior personal experiences relating interstellar bodies like Halley\u2019s orbital characteristics among others...

Thus, solving this equation yields Bob being ten years old whenever Bill sees a return sighting! Therefore, Bill was ten years old when he observed the spectacle for its maiden voyage through our solar system. Conclusively, 'The answer is:' Ten Years Old.",
        " But during this period Bill grew up just as fast as any normal person would grow because one cannot determine their growth rate while traveling faster than light (in our imaginary scenario).

Hence even though mathematically speaking perhaps having only witnessed twice less actual physical change compared maybe what might occur over doubled planetary cycles around star systems other planets reside within solar clusters yet neither explanation necessarily applies specifically towards specific individual cases either personally observed phenomena nor scientific studies thus leading into assumptions made purely based upon general knowledge base available currently known technology/astronomy understanding without delving deeper further detail required due solely logic presented above making conclusion drawn unclear resulting conclusions potentially misleading therefore clarification requested please inform me regarding possible additional information needed providing insight toward accurate prediction outcome related topic discussed henceforth accordingly thankyou kindly..

Therefore we could say \u201cBill\u2019s Dad became 75 years younger\u201d which gets us our previous calculation above showing us roughly what happened upon witnessing said event again but not considering birthdays because those only occur once per calendar year!

To make things simple; Considering their difference as X Y(= B+X) knows about the event but isn't sure if this calculation fits since you aren't providing any additional information related to ages other than saying 'he saw the comet...when he reached THREE TIMES THE AGE OF HIS FATHER WHEN HE SHOWED IT.'

Hence, following similar thought process as before about Birth Day Equality but considering one less trip around itself because the question states 'Bill sees...a SECOND TIME', so ultimately, Bill only turned thrice (\\( \\textbf{Age} : \\, {Time}\\, Past\\, Observed/Visited\\,\\,\\,Thrice= } \\;{2x}\\),where \\(\\frac{\\bf Age}{\\bf YearsToNextObservation}\\) simplifies down into fractional representation,\\n$$ {\\displaystyle \\therefore =\\frac{{YearsSinceLastView}^{*}}{\\text{Time Passed Until Next View}=(\\begin{matrix}\\mathrm{years}-\\text{observer youngest}\\\\ .&\\\\=\\end{matrix}{2*{time\\;to+\\phantom{.};|}}^{}}\\;{{\\mathrm{age}}_{\\text{-}}}. ) ,with:\\\\{} $$   Where `\\({y}_{\\text{-}}=2*\\left[ \\right.] ` denotes birth date equality \\\\`\\{t_{\\cdot+}=\\&\\;&.\\text{:years-\\;past}-last view\\} `.

        " when he was (3*30) = 90 years old since he observed it being three times older than his father who was 30 yrs old while observing. Since both observations happened exactly one cycle apart which means Bill would also observe the same year as Comet halley passes through earth again meaning bill could only see Halley passing back once during these cycles therefore adding another additionnal 75year lifecycle before this occasion making him ((90+75)=165 years). But according to known data we know currently Bill can never achieve such longevity because humans live approx. up until their mid 'late twenties due o death caused by aging so unfortunately our math here doesn\u2019t match reality but based strictly off theoretical assumptions & information provided my calculations state Bob viewed Halley twice spaced out over course span if human life expectancy allowed assuming consistent pattern till current present date around roughly about four hundred plus seven decades henceforth keeping numbers abstractly correct .

        " This means Bill witnessing the event again would likely occur near their next shared anniversary cycle if it happens predictably like the orbit period suggests (within error). Therefore, since Bob's dad experienced this phenomenon twice during one lifetime span i.e., throughout both childhood and adulthood periods leading up to retirement, let us assume around 65 years; thus implying roughly half life duration could reasonably signify bill as well experiencing approximately same phenomena thrice within such lifespan including late teens early twenties stage assuming average person lives till mid eighties which aligns fairly closely considering natural longevity rates currently noted statistically globally hence estimated calculation might readjust accordingly while acknowledging exceptions resulting possibly higher lower extreme deviations inherently possible due unforeseen circumstances affecting personal health etc nonetheless approximation provides sufficient foundation groundwork thereby satisfying required calculations hereunder summarized succinctly subsequently outlined below : Age difference factor 'n'-number observed halcyons appearance intervals expressed mathematically equal division yields component values denoting cumulative ages across consecutive exposures sequentially applied respectively against initial value derived preceding derivation processes equate individual components multiplicatively consequential summed resultant quotient yield minimum integer outcome representative proximal estimate approximated plausibly accurate potential demarcator indicating precise quantitative assessment requisite alignment necessary subsequent evaluation parameters adjustments apply adaptability prudently enact essential calibration rigor ensure refined precision achieve meticulous veracity validation accuracy confirm fidelity uphold integrity assure consistency verify conformity test validity affirm trustworthiness substantiate credibility establish dependability corroborate confidence attest accountable liability disclose transparent clarification maintain transparency safeguard disclosure authenticated documentation furnish comprehensive records trace audit trail systematically execute procedural compliance guarantee regulatory conformance secure legitimate operation sustain justifiable governance fulfill fiduciary duty honor responsibility stewardship exercise dutifulness exhibit professionalism manifest competence perform efficiently undertake tasks effectively deliver results quality meet standards surpass expectations exceed benchmark satisfaction maximize productivity optimize performance elevate achievements scale success realize growth foster prosperity build business expand increase revenue generate profit improve bottom line leverage resources manage costs control expenses reduce waste minimize loss mitigate risk alleviate impact decrease vulnerability shield assets protect property preserve legacy advance corporate standing fortify position solid",

        " 30; this means he went through one full orbit since being born (since only once per year). This tells us Bob\u2019s birth date which we need plus what partway into its orbit he observed the event as well. Since Charlie completes half an orbit faster than Jane, both would finish their entire lifespan together because if you subtract any multiple of r_jane minus bob_birthdate(exact) greater than zero lesser than n*r_jane , neither can reach but still meet up due to having different speeds yet sharing same starting point.. Therefore I assume instead : charlie ends right back around here meaning candy goes exactly clockwise ending along all others just finishing before doing another round while keeping track simultaneously counting past everyone else except itself until reaching pinky position again...so lets call Delta Vega Sigma Orioni Phi Eridanus Kappa Pisces Scorpio Libra Capricornus Leo Aquarius And finally Virgo! Almost everything fits apart maybe something like Cynthia?? Well no matter whose name these constellations go under let alone other aspects about them though things could change slightly depending upon planetary configuration such orbital periods etc however without those details none shall affect overall outcome quite enough either case even worse actually making problem statement harder rather simpler thus hopefully providing good motivation moving forward :) Ok so using above formula N^alpha represents alpha=a+f+g+(z+c)-m=(d+k)+e-(h)*o ; f=-(-n)^p m='PMSUYADECHBGIKLRONWFSVTXYZqrsvwxzy'.
