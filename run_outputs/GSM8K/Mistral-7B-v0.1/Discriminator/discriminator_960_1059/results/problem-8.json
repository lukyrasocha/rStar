Therefore, you can assume one quarter used Synthetic Gut & One Half uses Polysterneet whilst another Quarter also goes towards Hybrid Sets as follows ; Two Racquets requiring High levels of Flexibility go under POLYESTER STRING SETUP which contributes additional effort amounting up to 2x(their respective values), hence generating overall contribution worth 2*(Polyesternes) .

Adding these times we get 45+110+144 which equals <<45+110+144=299>>299 minutes overall required time or roughly around 4 hours and about thirty three minutes working continuously without breaks. Therefore the answer cannot directly relate into minute since human work generally considers taking short intervals/breaks while not being able perform full tasks like 'racquet restring'.
