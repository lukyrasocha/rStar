Finally, when evening rolls around, seven additional members joined bringing about sixteen extra rooms filled resulting in finally having altogether just ninety four occupants (`91 guests + 7 others`).

Finally adding up this equation yields:[original]+[(later additions per preliminary restrictions]*([units replaced per restriction])+(extra)|>=7)=((previous numbers)[additional spaces]). Thus we conclude our solution needs to account not just simply subtractive measures but also multiplicative contributions made over time hence proving:(initial occupants\u2212checked-out)added along with evening checks equal necessary accommodation.(rooms currently empty upon initial evaluation=(number present prior departure\u2014those choosing later options), thereby confirmingthe factmore visitors came than actually chose delayed access.) We may summarize accordingly:Initial guest count:=hotel capacity :=100Checked Out Group:=(Early CheckOuters + LateCheckOutrs)::=24Late Option Choosers :(This group alone dictates further arithmetic relations since their choice affectstheir corresponding counterparts\u2018 influxes.).Restriction Implications Regarding Addition / Replacementof Occupied SpacesFor reference/contextual interpretation let\u2019s define:(spaces immediately vacated),(supplementary increments owingto nocturnal lodgers),(further adjustment basedon original ratio constraintsfor overalloccupancy fulfillment)..Then apply these labels into existing equations respectively while keeping track within scope limits..As stated beforeour problem revolves around changes occurringsimultaneously throughout specific intervalswith various groups interacting intime dynamicsso applying direct subtractionis appropriatebut incorporatingswift additionrequires considerationdue changing circumstanceswhich impact future resultsand interrelationsamong involved partiesSo here goes\u2026 First off calculatingreduced availability firstwe knowthat:Left Guest Count :=Room Capacity:-Guests Departed=-Checked Out TotalNow computing supplementary spaceacquisitionvia nighttime visitorshipWe findThatNumber Added Due To Night Visitors:=NightTime ArrivalIncrementBased Upon Earlier Preferences*(Factor Multiplying Original Ratioval",
        " bringing up the count to (61+30) + 7= 98 . Therefore, Hotel still hosts only 98 guests even though it previously hosted all its occupants every single night since Monday till Sunday , having never turned away any customer ever during this weekend visitation period .. Thus we conclude : **Guests remaining inside the premises currently amounting to** :: `"
