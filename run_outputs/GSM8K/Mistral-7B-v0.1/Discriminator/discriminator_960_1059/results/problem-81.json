        " getting this option ($6.50/person) times (10 persons), resulting in a product worth $65 spent on the chicken salad alone. Next calculate the price tagged onto just one serving of Pasta Salad which costs roughly half as expensive again like so it would make sense if you doubled everything else here because we only wanted enough plates not all the extra stuff... Hence calculating $.05 X .6=.$3 ; thus , since six parties opt against going without them instead choose another choice; thereby reducing overall demand down significantly while simultaneously cutting back expenses quite nicely ;) Calculate summed up totals based off those figures above along wtih respect too! Based upon these numbers listed below : Number    Type           Price     Quantity      Cost Total   Chicken          $                        N/A              $       N/A               Count         Person            $             Perce Unit                Required ",
        " times $6.50 equals 65$. Next, the pasta salad costs $6 per person. Six people wants this so six multiplied by sixty equals thirty-six$ . Add together both totals; fifty-one dollars plus thirty-six dollar comes out to eighty-seven dollars. To recap let\u2019s write down all our steps here as follows: Chicken Salad : cost= 6.5(person) ; People Requesting This Food Option= 10    =>   Total Cost Of Order      (people request)(cost/per_person)=     (number requested)*multiplication(*)        ==>                             Calculation ",
        " cost of Chicken Salad : $$$",
        " salad (which costs $6.50) \u00d7 Number of people who chose this option ($10). This equals $65 . Next let\u2019s count the other meals\u2026 Since no one wanted anything else but just chicken or pasta salad , so all remaining guests get these only! That leaves us wthout any additional expense associated here apart form before calculated amounts above stated thus eliminated as unnecessary variables within solution scope ! Finally adding up both sums results into Grand Total payment owed towards supplier/caterer equal TO $$$$$ including taxes etc based purely off initial provided factors without further modifications nor additions necessary due lack thereof \u2026 Calculations complete !! Result : TOTAL COST= $(their respective totals )+$(additional charges /taxes)(if applicable); Final Amount Payable=(Total Cost)=($x+$y)+(Additional Charges)/(Tax Rate)) Where \u2018\u2018X,\u2019Y; AdditionalCharges & TaxRate refers specific calculation cases depending upon regional laws governing same.) \u2013 Explanation Endpoint Here Explaining formulaically using LaTeX equations denotes explicit clarity while ensuring accurate computative procedures undertaken throughout entire process till completion stage .. Note:- Although mentioned terms appear rather verbose often encountered among finance professionals however usage itself shouldn\u2019t impede comprehension especially when present context involves basic arithmetic operations involving single variable denominator.. Also worth mention ing term \u201cFinalAmouontPayable\u201d representing absolute sum required financially compensatory toward relevant beneficiaries according agreed arrangements priorhand agreements thereby providing closure regarding matter pending resolution ; therefore concluding discussion effectively ends point!! Thankyou kindly sir :-) :) :-)) ;) ???? ?? :( ~~~~ _",
        " (in hundreds): 10/1*6.5= $65 . Next let\u2019s figure out the price of all the other types of salads except one since only four prices are mentioned before I run into trouble here! Sorry about this mistake but feel free mention if you wish your question answered differently perhaps without these extra details :) !!! Oh wait yeah right i meant say something like... instead look up just what goes together when ordering sandwiches along wihout talking numbers etc because those items wouldn't come under usual category \u201csalad\u201d :).
