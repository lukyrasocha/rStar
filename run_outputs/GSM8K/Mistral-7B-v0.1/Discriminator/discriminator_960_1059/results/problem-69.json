Next calculate how many yellow balloons broke when scared by the sudden noise: Half of the 12 yellow balloons breaks; so we lose six (1/2) yellows. Find out what remains among both colored types: We add up our totals thus far -- 15 intact Red ones plus 7 Green equals thirty-two whole balloons not counting Yellow anymore since these halved off their count...but! They actually came away unscathed because this event didn\u2019t affect any other color besides just those Greens :( No further action required regarding 'unburnt' colors here aside from reiteration ; no actual change occurs henceforth\u2026and remember why ?
