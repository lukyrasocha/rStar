Thus over the duration of thirty days we can expect (($120/week\u2756 weeks/month)=(120\u00f74).

Total Earnings In Monthly terms : $(Session Cost )* No._of_Students * no_of_weeks .So Substituting all our values into the equation above ; `(Cost\u00a0+($1.5/$student))*$Number_of_students $\\times \\frac {no_{weeks}}{daily}$=$(40)$*\\times  10$\\times \\frac {3}{Day}(~For\\ ~\\ about ~ whole \\ month)}{}={12k}$.

Consequently, these numbers amount to 40*10=$400 earned. Therefore, the annual income can be considered as , $$(n\\times {R_{Cycle}}).$$ Here we get n=no_of_cycles taken which is equal to 10 here .

        " rented three times a week, it means that we divide this figure into 30/4 or about every 7th day which equals approximately four weeks (since most months aren\u2019t exactly divisible by 3). Hence, if you repeat your calculation over those few recurring instances; i.e., multiplying our figures above by four \u2013 since such schedule applies throughout any particular average monthly span\u2013you obtain as follows:$25 (rental rate) X  4 sessions X    [students ($1.50)    \t         +      \t            staff]                        =             $140 /month . The answer is: 140.",
        " would be 25 / 3 = approximately $8.33 (to nearest cent). Multiply this amount by thirty days which amounts to about $8.33 * 30=approximately$249. Henceforth we find out exactly how much it costs for all sessions in those three weeks as follows; calculate what ten times $1.5 equals. Ten multiplied against fifteen cents equal seventy point five because ten times 1.5 equals seven hundred fifty divided by twenty four since you divide both sides equally hence our next calculation becomes calculating what forty six points eight ($249) subtracted from seven thousand minus sixty five divides evenly among thirty days means ninety deducted every other time except last turn ending up with nineties remaining . We round off these decimals making them whole numbers thereby eliminating fractions altogether leaving us merely integers only while still maintaining their accuracy despite having rounded decimal places already being reduced previously mentioned above therefore simplifying further reduction using same logic yet again until reaching actual dollar value rather than just simply adding or taking away without understanding why said action could possibly happen but also knowing when its necessary dueoften occurring within business equations involving currency conversion rates such purchases usually result either directly towards profit maximization opportunities like discounts obtained earlier through negotiation skills applied during sale periods whenever possible ; however , sometimes loss occurs owing perhaps financial constraints faced locally caused mostly probably abroad via foreign exchange markets affecting local prices albeit temporary nature nevertheless causing frustration amongst consumers who seek reasonable alternatives otherwise spending vast sums unnecessarily beyond available resources required obtain products intended purchase purposes regardless location concerned thus creating economic imbalance everywhere around region affected overall society becoming disadvantaged financially over period longer term particularly impacting poorer communities most greatly experiencing detrimental effects upon daily life routines including education healthcare etcetera resulting adverse social implications across entire populations afflicted similarly nationwide scenario emerging globally especially developed nations relying heavily upon imports versus domestic goods produced domestically leading international trade deficits currently plaguing modern world economy facing significant downturn threatening national security interests ultimately risking global stability unless remedied sooner rather later before critical situation arises capable damaging human lives forever altering course historical events transpired numerous occasions previous centuries throughout history civilizations fought wars waged battles won destroyed empires vanished conquerors eradicated existing order built",

Subtracting this amount from the current charges shows you what part goes towards profit margins or overhead expenses. Repeat these calculations based off different sets & quantities such as varying numbers/types/prices so we can see changes over time compared against previous periods which would demonstrate trends within your business operations accordingly allowing adjustments via improved techniques leading toward higher efficiency levels eventually maximizing profits furthermore enabling future growth opportunities beyond expectations without needless waste!

As it currently serves 10 people daily ($1.50 per person), this adds another charge of $1.50*10=$<<1.5*10=15>>15/session or $15*(3)/week(rental days) which equals $(15)(3)=$ <<15*3=45>>45 .
