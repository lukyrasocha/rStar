However, when asked about 'total spending', we focus only on transactions made without considering any potential leftovers or savings/remaining balances resulting from previous actions; thus focusing strictly just on this transactional context it resulted us in being able to conclude \"$66\" as our definitive numerical result based purely within said confines but not extending into considerations involving post purchasing funds retention etc..

Thus, combined expenditure sums up as $($48+$24) or altogether equals to $72 spent. Therefore, if we subtract this amount from what was initially present i.e., $200-$72=$128 remains untouched post transactions; hence concluded being correct under scenario provided it aligns well within financial bounds without breaching any deficits encountered pre/post operations conducted thus far presented hereinforthwith.$ ",
        " 3 = $60 (for books) + $18 (for pencils). Thus, overall, he spent $60+$18=$78. Therefore, Edward would be remaining with $200-$78= $122 as compared to option C which mentions him having only earned back $110 making it incorrect hence choice D also correct but not necessary because earning wasn\u2019t mentioned anywhere above.. We can consider options B & E both accurate yet contextual understanding dictates considering lesser numbers since we see no indication about additional funds/earnings provided within scenario limits thereby removing 'C'.
