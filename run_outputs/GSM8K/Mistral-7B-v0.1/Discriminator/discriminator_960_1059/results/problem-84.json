Converting Xavier's original size (in feet) into inches reveals that it equaled ten additional inches plus four inches equaling sixteen inches overall; adding these thirty extra inches leads us to conclude that he stands twelve inches high currently\u2014that includes those measured during childhood as well. As we know Coles began out life measuring up around fifty pounds whereas minuscule measurements such as sixty millimeters or even one meter still remain within our realm \u2013 but I won't stop here because if someone asked me what length would represent this new measurement against which all others could stand upon\u2013heaven help them! Transformations require careful consideration before jumping right away onto finding differences without taking time enough considering potential pitfalls regarding ambiguities found across various types like units used among humans versus machines etc.; especially when involving factors including age/gender ratios so far beyond understanding human nature itself .

        " because when we change measurements it helps us get rid of units which can make calculations easier; so this turns into (4*12) + 3= 51 inches or converted back as needed depending upon your required measurement unit later. Cole's new height would hence turn out to be 50+2 =  52 inches if you want all values calculated using same base measure i.e., convert everything to 'inches'. Hence comparing these two measures shows us what one may find useful most especially during comparative analysis scenarios like our current task here \u2013 since its asking about \u2018difference\u2019 therefore deducting smallest value form largest amongst them makes sense rather than dividing/adding etc.; thus resulting being (-1)/(inch).

        " Cole as being equal since Xavier starts off exactly four times heavier than Colin (since one pound equals roughly sixteen pounds). Therefore if you multiply any weight measurement value by twelve (or whatever factor this relationship stands), it still equates back up to its original state before multiplication began--so let us use ten again just because... This means when combined these measurements would form something approximately equivalent about eleven kilograms -- which could easily represent someone who might fit within common classroom ranges like yours truly :) . Finally , subtract those weights together : Ten minus Eleven yields Zero . Thus our calculation comes out rightly; however note here please avoid using rounding methods such '.com 'and also try recalculating directly via manual computation instead!

        " even before growing Xavier would be shorter than Cole because Cole's initial height (before growth) exceeds what you get when adding four times ten minus one foot plus three additional inches compared with being exactly forty eight inches high due to fact twelve makes sixty so we need sixteen extra ones equaling twenty. Also consider this scenario as simply counting all lengths together starting from zero centimeters upwards; hence if someone starts standing still without moving their legs around until something causes movement such getting off your chair onto another part nearby causing motion against gravity helping them gain momentum while simultaneously reducing balance loss through friction caused interaction points along bones creating kinetic energy stored within muscles during contraction phases known commonly referred terms sports science discipline studies these factors contributing potential maximum speed achievable based upon individual physical characteristics related biometrics including heart rate variability measured via electrodes attached directly beneath skin surface covering vital organ(either side rib cage area near pectoral region close towards sternal notch/base).

Moreover, taking note furthermore about these growth aspects involving physical alterations due to biological maturation processes such individuals undergo throughout varying age groups could offer insights toward comprehending underlying phenomena associated within contextual paradigms surrounding human development trajectories including not only quantitative assessments pertaining linear extensions across temporal continuums observed during specific junctures like Summer recesses commonly recognized among youthful demographics subject to similar academic cycles etc., yet also necessitating careful considerations encompass evaluative methodologies alongside multi-variate factors engendering potential disparities when appraising relative advancements manifested post periods marked annually commencing Autumn seasons symbolizing transitional milestones occurrences thereby implying subsequent differential rates experienced amongst various subjects pursuing comparable educational pathways aligned harmoniously aligning simultaneously accommodating personalized experiences manifest distinct variances hinge primarily influencing outcomes achieved consequently affecting long-term prospectivist perspectives harboring aspirations correlated directly interlaced intricately woven complex systems dictating projections forecast estimates subsequently shaping narratives articulating possibilities realised ultimately materializing destiny entwined fate destinies bound tightening fates future unfoldings reveal divergent paths emerge discernible contrastions arising juxtaposing elements yield dichotomous results uncover differencing layers shedding light illuminating obscured truths buried deep beneath surface level observations mask veiling details disguised revelatory discoveries transform tangled web bewildering mysterious unknown territories navigational journeys traversing challenging landscape obstacles confronted steering course direct compelling progress journey venture succeed overcome conquering adversity triumph victory surmount impositions resistance embracing change adapt transition evolving becoming transformed personified representing exemplars inspiring hope dream empowerment propelling forward motivating generations moving beyond boundaries limit confines constraints barriers limitations breaking through ceil",

Next find Cole's length using information provided about growth only when explicitly mentioned i.e., grows up \u2018(it wasn\u2019t said whether cole changed or not)\u2019. Accordingly calculating new possible lengths of coy if assumed changes like below one could conclude  50ft=3*X [where X denotes unknown increase] ;->Solving above equation yields;-->  Hence according this assumption coefficient solution would yield Coel size > Xvaryer/initial situation --> implying no data available enough to draw concrete conclusions..

Since exact initial parameters regarding any incremental transformation couldn't be extracted based solely off textual content presented\u2026we proceed via intuitive speculation\u2014given known constraints such instances often involve linear transformations relative dimensions ..so inferring indirect relations / proportionate adjustments may prove fruitful within context...if initially set ratios maintained throughout entire domain \u2014resultant disparity might indeed bear positive correlation proportional relation thus indicating escalated dimensional scaling post event horizon shift .
