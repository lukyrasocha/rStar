        " Combining like terms, this becomes 4X - X - 3X - 13 = 331. Further combining like terms results in 3X - 13 = 331. Finally, adding 13 to both sides yields  3X = 344 . Dividing through by three allows us to solve for 'x'. Therefore, 3*Adelwolfge_pokeballs=3*4 so adjollygaeerboycatches =(total pokemunks/4)-13=(339)/4-13,(approx)=85-(approx)=72 ,so stancatchstillbeatsalextacytwentythreepokestoothenupagaininsecondroundofthisawesomegame!(finalanswer)",
        " 13 - 6X = 331. Combining like terms, we get -2X + 331 = 331. Adding 2X to both sides gives us 2X = 0 because adding or subtracting zero won't change anything but would leave me unbalanced.

        " if we add together what Adrianoel (Adri) and Stan have captured this would mean; `(x+5)+(x+(x*4)-13)=339`. Combining like terms results into `2*(number of pokemons Adrianella [Adri]caught)`. Therefore you get ;`x+(x*4)+5-(13=6`, so adding those up equals;`5x=-2`. You can solve for the unknown value \u2018x\u2019 using algebraic manipulation such as moving constants around or distributing/factoring etc...

Because this equals our overall amount. Substitute numbers into variables and you get:(279)=(334)+((Stan)*2). Solving for Stan=(334-279)/2 or Stanley caught approximately 27.5 pokeballs. But unfortunately pokes don\u2019t come whole , like I said approximatly stanley only caught about half one another person .
