Thus, doubling again would make it four times larger than our smallest option ($3), meaning the full size package for just one single unit worth would thus come out at $12. Hence, three units sold would bring us back up to those original selling numbers; tripled off these, the equivalent amount of $9 per bundle becomes available henceforth making sure uniformity stays consistent across every offering throughout their product array assortment regardless of quantity being delivered or purchased.. Therefore, according what was inferred through logical calculation based upon initial offered pricing structure provided within contextual narrative scenario presented herein earlier part regarding said retailer's strategy behind maintain constant ratio/multiplier factor amongst successive batch(or series) sequences comprised among varying quantities entertained vis versa alongside respective dollar exchange rates involved when selecting products ranging along quantitative spectrum starting point initiated using least denominatively represented form thereby ultimately reaching maximal absolute extremum limit imposed beforehand constraining boundaries precluding potential deviations emerging spontaneously due unavoidable circumstantial fluctuations impacting real estate valuation metrics dictating market demand pressure whilst preserving customer satisfaction guarantee irrespective individual consumer preferences particularizing discrete behavioral traits specific subset subpopulation demographic profile subjectively inclined toward certain purchasing dynamics aligned collective societal economic environment overarching trend analysis paradigm shifting prevailing status quo norms undergone historical temporal evolutionary progression progress continuum ensuring sustainability long term viability prospect optimizations aim maximize utility efficiently resource optimization effectiveness operational efficiency innovate create competitive advantage attract investments capital flow stimulate regional development foster local entrepreneurship promote job creation enhance living standards uplift communities empower citizens encourage active civic participation strengthen social cohesion build solid foundation prosperous future human society secure dignified peaceful coexistence preserve planet earth protect biodiversity conserving natural habitats ensure intergenerational equity mitigate climate change address global challenges confront evolving circumstances adapt agile respond decisively tackle complex problems devise practical solution comprehensive integrated approach leveraging synergistic collaborations harness diverse expertise pool integrate multidisciplinary perspectives deliver inclusive govern",
        " Therefore, if you want only buy a single unit (a half), your average or midpoint would just be ($3+$6)/2 which equals $4.5 per piece. To get our value related back onto whole units again though instead of halves--we need as well multiply the amount of 'pieces\u2019 being purchased times our earlier found result--so multiplying out, since 8 divided evenly into packages gets us exactly twice across all size options listed here(2x=the small option doubles up once , making them equalize their respective overall cost vs other bigger versions) --multiplies further together results thus indicate four($4.5*2)=$9 bucks for either getting triplets worth of any type packaged variety mentioned above OR eight slices individually valued! Here lies evidence supporting original proposition concerning quantities linked proportionally through common factors within groups sharing identical ratios throughout distribution channels regardless quantity variances themselves applied differently upon said ratio expressions---consequently validated therefore demonstratively confirmation arrived arriveth rightaway directly attuned suitably correlatetowithin established baselines undergone prior investigations undertaken extensively analyzed minutely scrutinized exhaustive comprehensiveness encompassedly inclusively incorporatefully intertwined harmoniously coherently integratinelly assimilatelendistinctibly juxtaposed synthesized discerningly dissected judiciously examined thoroughly meticulously evaluated critically contemplatively appraised diligently appreciated thoughtfully considered carefully reflected introspectivelibrately internalisely assessed holisticy conclusivelessness absolutesomnibundly definiteliness unambivalentabsoluteness nonambiguously indubitabilitycogency clarity transpareny lucidpenetrant disambiguationstriplentuitycomplementarityamalgamturesynthesisinterconnectivitycoherenceintegratenessharmonyuniformclarityseamlessconsistencystabilitypredictabilityreliableaffordabilitytractibilityflexibililityamenabilityadaptabilitiestodynamicversatilitydynamicresiliencerobusturabilitypercebblissimplicitysimpliciterelegancefrugalityproportionalprinciplemerevaluativenovellinenewvalueconstructablenesscraftsmanshipcreativityingenuitiesympathiegenerationalsymmetryasynchronicitydiversityindispersionunityequalityegalitarian",
        " sandwiches would either cost $6 or $12 since both scenarios follow proportionate pricing rules observed so far ($3/2=1.5, same as $6/$4). Therefore, without further information about discount policy (which might suggest lower cost) neither option seems likely based strictly off initial data provided. It could go any way up till infinity theoretically because no bound was set. Thus, while possible interpretations exist like choosing lowest plausible value which leads us towards least expensive model; mathematically precise estimation goes beyond direct comparison using available info suggesting ambiguity due to potential unboundedness under 'proportional' rule interpretation i.e., assuming strict scaling may apply across all quantity units even into very large quantities despite seemingly impractical financial settings usually encountered within retail context such common stores worldwide selling food items including bread loaves etc.) ",
