Initially, we start counting here as time starts accumulating. Count this change over next four hours (at High Mode): This phase considers another operation segment taking place simultaneously along same period; consequently resulting into double efficiency due simultaneous execution across both rates mentioned initially hence multiplying their individual effects together yielding effective result ((-(+2))*(-3)*(\u22121)))/2 , or simply summing them individually first followed by adding negative sign back : (((\u22122)+(\u22123)))/2)=\u20145/2=-2.5\u00b0C thus implying entire range occupied falls within midpoint interval since division indicates equal sharing among modes used jointly even though physical conditions indicate less workload relative percentage wise being attributed toward second component.
