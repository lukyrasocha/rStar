        " through understanding what it means when someone is said to be 'a certain percentage (in this case, 25%) younger'. It signifies subtracting such percentages proportionately from another amount; here we take away one quarter or 25%, since every fourth part constitutes twenty-five per cent -- hence dividing up four equal parts representing their respective proportions out of which exactly three represents majority portions while only remaining single portion indicates minority share/age difference under consideration. To figure above statement mathematically : Total ages divided into quarters -> Every component comprises approximately eight year duration(since original quantity stands upon even dozen terms) Subtract those extra units correspondingly according due equivalence ratio [which implies removing just once term unit] From initially established sum you may extract seven additional periods within overall span thus arriving right figures accordingly namely:: Initial accumulation was quadruple sixteen so adding further individualities yields eighteen altogether , therefore bringing forth aggregate summation being equally distributed amongst combined familial entities results precisely aligning ten & twelve respectfully across distinctive offspring categories Hence concluding numerical evaluation process confirms accurateness ensuring correctness prevails despite potential misinterpretations arising surrounding numeral symbolism / representation practices used commonly elsewhere ..
