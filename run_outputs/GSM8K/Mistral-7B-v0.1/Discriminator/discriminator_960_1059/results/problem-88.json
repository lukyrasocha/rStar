Also bear in mind consumer demand driven business cycles influence such changes frequently thus contributing significantly towards economic activity patterns affecting supply chain dynamics overall leading perhaps eventually influencing pricing structures indirectly thereby impacting net profits ultimately determining firm sustainability going forward assuming all else remains stable barring unanticipated shock factors externalities etc..
