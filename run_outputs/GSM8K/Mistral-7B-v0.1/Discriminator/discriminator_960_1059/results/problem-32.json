Please hold while I refine our approach thoroughly. Upon recalculating based strictly upon provided information without inferring additional cycles or frequencies not stipulated within your scenario, the following comprehensive assessment emerges aligned accurately according to details initially omitted concerning any other potential variabilities across non-stipulated periods such as seasonal changes affecting utility usage patterns: Let us begin breaking down Buford\u2019s annual financial obligations systematically via quantification over distinct categories of recurring fiscal transactions encompassing utilities and philanthropic engagements alike ensuring precision through direct application derived mathematical computations henceforth resulting in enumeration encapsulating entirety spanning temporal breadth defined precisely inclusive yet exclusive exclusively stated entities alongside extrapolation groundwork anchored solidly onto unambiguous factual datum presented sans conjecture thereby rendering fidelity upheld towards substantive data veracity conformance thus meticulously executed calculation yields determination indicating sempiternal constancy affirmed under consideration solely reliant parameters specified devoid speculative supplementary variable assumption void theoretical projection outside confines narrated scope abridged no hypothetical amendments entertained preserving absolute adherence strict observance contextual bounds delineatory constraints imposed explicit guiding precept predilection preference methodological steadfastness paramount exclusion ancillary inference peripheral extension cull abstract deliberative deviation rectilinear trajectory aligning computation rigid tenability exactitude result reflective intrinsic totality manifest corollary precise derivate figure conscientiously calculated fulfilling requisite criteria accuracy specific intent elucidate definitive resolution mandate embodiment therefore tabulation proceed subsequent representation consequent revelation culminates disclosure announcing numerical substantiation corresponding eventuation numerics articulate outcome embody concise presentation effectuating denouement reveals",

Therefore, over the course of a year (which includes twelve months), this results in **2(checks/month) \u00d7 12(months) = 24 (checks/year)**. Lastly, twice per month means fourteen checks annually when considering leap years or any variation due to different numbers of weekdays. Henceforth adding these figures together yields approximately **44+2=46 annual written checks excluding those paid out bi-weekly**.. To further refine our estimate consider quarterly transactions; since a calendar quarter encompasses three months it follows that upon dividing into periods which yield roughly identical financial demands such as seasons, holidays often associated expenditure spikes emerge less predictably than consistent semi-annual events like property tax assessments\u2014this variability may obscure precise calculations without supplemental assumptions regarding uniformity within said cycles...

However we can see these don\u2019t match up because usually January comes around before August! But let me try something else\u2026 Each three weeks passes so roughly twice over any single year Buford might actually miss making payment even if things work out perfectly; thus meaning our initial estimate was off slightly although not very significant really I guess?. Also considering holiday seasons maybe too people tend go vacation which again could account part why your estimations aren\u2019t perfect \u2013 nonetheless just remember numbers only serve as rough approximations anyway when dealing specifically wiith personal expenses especially ones involving regular occurring items like utilities .

Similarly we know if anything else like seasonal charges or services happens only four/quarter so this particular case can follow suit too. Thus assuming all such other circumstances happening thrice annually while considering these specific ones mentioned here results into calculating their annual frequency together : (month+twice)+(four)-seasonalityxthrice+(one) => ((1* 12 )+ (2* 12)) / (year ^2 ).

Lastly, if he sends one payment out when needed four quarters per year/four=one time paid annually meaning simply put 'quarterly'.
