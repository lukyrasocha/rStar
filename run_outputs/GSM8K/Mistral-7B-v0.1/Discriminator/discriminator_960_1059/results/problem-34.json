Nonetheless understanding basics allows greater ease tackling future topics similarly structured allowing progressions forward rather slow pace required initially although definitely worthwhile perseverance ultimately rewarding sufficient motivation kept firmly focused attention mind throughout entire sequence completion especially so noted case studying patterns presented various examples detailed thoroughly helping reinforce learners foundational knowledge essential mastery attaining fully comprehended theories accurately applied whenever needed correctly answering related test questionns successfully guarantee success rate approaching maximum possible outcome achieved goal set forth expectantly !! Finally remember learning isn&apost never ending always evolving experience growing deeper richer layer upon top even seemingly mundane tasks present opportunities build foundation necessary expand abilities improve intellect making oneself better equipped handle whatever comes next journey life throws us way :) Good luck everyone!! Keep pushing hard stay positive outcomes sure follow instructions carefully dontrush",
        " Tobias (since igeneus equals T+C): Thus getting this expression : 20+40+(2*20) , which simplifies into : 20+40+40=<<20+40+40=100>>100 s . To convert it to mins divide it over sixes because one min contains sixty secs(not fifty), so dividing 100/6 yields approximately equal value to round off our calculation here... That means both values agree! Therefore; ",
        " other two wolves' howling durations x 2 = Total Duration (in seconds). First calculate what Tobias and Chikote contribute; it equals 2*20=40seconds or half minute. Since Igneous contributes equal amount of sounding than both previous Wolves, so adding their sounds takes another full minute plus one-half making Totalsoundings= hour. Convert our result into mins by dividing totaldurationsounds / 60 : Minutesofhowlsmadeis  1 . "
