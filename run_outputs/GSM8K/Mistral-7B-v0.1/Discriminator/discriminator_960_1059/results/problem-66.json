        " a steel pickaxe when compared to using an iron pickaxe. First calculate the amount mined daily with an iron pickaxe; multiply the initial production (12 pounds) by 2 because it doubles its value\u2014this equals 12*2=<<12*2=24>>24 pounds/daily mining rate with only an Iron Pickaxe. Calculate the increase produced when switching to Steel which increases yield another 50%; To find this additional quantity use previous result multiplied by 0.5 or divide by 2 -- so add these together resulting in current producing capacity using both Tools \u2014-> [24+(24/2)] . This amounts out into --> Adding those up yields-->  24+12 ; Which sums up to :---> Add all calculations ending up being a----total metal extraction volume over time period(days). Use multiplication operator(*), addition (+) operators along with unit conversions necessary here.(pounds/(ton))To further complicate matters consider multiple dwarfs sharing equipment amongst themselves , working concurrently but even still you needn\u2019t convert units since we want our final output also expressed according weight basis i.e., Pounds.---> Find individual contribution considering tool advantage -> Total combined effort based upon stated conditions applied above & collectively considered values::---[N] Dwarf*(Effort_Parch)*DaysPerMonth=(DWarns)(ParsonsHoursLtd )*. Efficient usage ensures maximum recovery possible under such circumstances provided no other interruptions occur like sickness etc.---> Multiply calculated sum accordingly thus getting right estimation ---=> Perform appropriate math operations including adjustments made due to varying workforces availability every passing hour throughout entire duration before arriving at precise conclusion ::==><|endofinstruction|>\"\"\" Considering optimal team organization principles described previously, estimate potential weekly ore extract rates if instead half the dwarf population switched exclusively to stone hammers reducing overall efficiency by a factor of three times. Provide your evaluation accounting for reduced productivity caused while transitioning staff across different manual tools \u2013 keep full numerical details intact within explanation framework\". "
