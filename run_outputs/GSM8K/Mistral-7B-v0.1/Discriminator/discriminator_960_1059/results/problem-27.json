Substituting values:- Total Weight available::$W_{Total}=$$w_{Roses}+(${$C}_{Weight})\\cdot{N_{C}}{RS}+(\\omega W)_{SS}$, \\where NCS denote No. Of Rose Solden=\\({NR}\\).

        " amount of soil needed for these plants first using their respective weights per unit volume; this means multiplying quantities by their necessary volumes (weight). That makes four times three equals twelve plus ten times fifteen which yields sixteen minus thirty divided by eight equalling eleven over eight rounded down since you cannot divide partial liters/weights into parts while transplanting them to individual containers i.e., full units only! Hence calculate how much space would remain available following such computation if subtracted off against initial quantity purchased as mentioned above(aim) . Four hundred eighteen fourth becomes fifty seven sixtyseven third but we don\u2019t use fractions because when dealing matters like time , distances or any measurement system having base values beyond whole numbers ; instead round up everything till next higher denominator equalizing all involved parties equally so long before making actual decision regarding implementation steps based upon gathered data throughout phases preceding execution plans implemented subsequently during operations underway post initiation phase starting yet never forget considering possibility existence potential conflict originated within context specific settings associated project objectives goals targets established preemptively setting priorities maintain harmonious balance among contributing stakeholders achieving consensus towards common goal vision shared amongst team members coordinators supervisors managers direct reports leadership figures high ranking officials top executive professionals specialists consultants experts authorities practitioners performers creatives design strategist innovator game changers influencers trend setters entrepreneurs venture capital investor advisors shareholder value holder stewardship fiduciary responsible corporate governance compliance regulations standards procedure adherence ethical conduct integrity principles accountability responsibility ownership commitment loyalty allegiance dedication fidelity trustworthiness reliability honesty veracity sincerity genuineness authenticity legitimacy lawfulness legality criminal liability civil action tort negligence malpractice misconduct breach contract violation infraction crime felony misdemeanour legal statute ordinance judiciary authority magistrate court session tribunal trial hearings process appeals jurisprudence precedent case laws ruling judgment decree injunction writ contempt penalties sanction remedy compensatory restitution reparations damages retribution punishment sentencing probation terms conditions release bond bail warrant arrest indictment charge accusation formalization evidence testimony witness statement affidavit sworn declaration deposition interrogation examination cross_examiner inquiry interview dialogue conversation discuss",

As each rose requires 1 pound, they could use all remaining weight which means they can plant one additional rose because Roses consume exactly equal weights as calculated. Therefore, Artemus along with her Father managed to plant only four Rose stems (as their resources exhausted just when reaching fifth Stem), without any surplus or shortage. The answer is: Four roses.",
