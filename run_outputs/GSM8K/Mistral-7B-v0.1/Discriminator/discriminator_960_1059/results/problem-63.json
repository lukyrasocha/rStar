We round off only when dealing with quantities like fruits or candies which cannot break into smaller ones otherwise fractions could mean half/quarter etc depending upon what u wanna imply but while thinking about food items , i generally go closer towards whole values hence here even though no indication was shown regarding whether someone consumed less than required , therefore my choice would still follow intrepretion mentioned earlier ie consider individual count within respective groups whoever consumes fully thus keeping calculation strictly based solely on integers instead fractionals thereby maintaining purity over approximation especially considering these being 'people involved\" :forthwith ; I shall proceed forthwith !

Moving forward, I shall provide corresponding logical formulas using universality notation '\u2200', existential assertion denoted as '\u2203', quantifiers like 'all', 'some,' etc., while also maintaining rigorous clarity throughout my explanation process. Below you can find comprehensive examples illustrative explanations along with direct formula derivation under specified scenarios which involve reasoning over provided natural language arguments involving various subjects such as books and authors across different genres mentioned explicitly concerning authorship criteria varying depending upon whether those works fall exclusively outside of specific literary categorizations ('Dramatic Works') versus not falling entirely exempt according to explicit conditions stated previously (\"the book was written during World War II but later than April\").

Consider recalculating while mindful not only individual quantities but also taking collective contribution into account whilst avoiding arithmetical mistakes.(Possible reasoning behind such result could lie either within improper comprehension about multiplication/addition principles regarding monetary values.)
