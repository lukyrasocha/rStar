As such your expression transforms into `(7*(9))` so equals=63 pretzel packets consumed within a week timeframe. Consequently, when provided that John consumes half portion compared to Edgar who gobbles up daily about 18 sticks making him equivalent to three whole portions, therefore dividing thirty six (total stick count) amongst himself equates fourteen (`(18+9)/2`) snack packs taken thrice over a full septum period amounting to fortytwo(`14x3`).
