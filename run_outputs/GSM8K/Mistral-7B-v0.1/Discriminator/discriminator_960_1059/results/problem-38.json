According to the prompt we know half of all these cookies (which adds up to \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\times 1500=750\\)) went off to the Church Next Door. Dividing this figure into equal groups according to their size indicates if everyone received exactly one cookie no individual would get extra or less than someone else which represents equality in distribution hence showing fairness among those who benefit directly when sharing resources; therefore dividing even portions means everybody receives same quantity regardless whether multiple individuals may claim ownership over them due diligence being exercised regarding collective use matters like donations etc.. Thus finding out just what portion goes through specific recipient group requires only calculating proportion relative value ratio based upon available goods set aside initially meant specifically intended toward another party while also ensuring minimum loss minimizing expenditure requirements whilst upholding principled moral standards associated proper resource allocation methods amongst stakeholder parties affected differently within respective jurisdictional boundaries governing such transactions namely gifting practices typically governance regulations applicable customary law traditions commonly accepted universal normative ethical principles embraced worldwide culturally reflectively applied interpersonal expectations rooted historic legal precedents setting historical benchmark cases demonstrating practical application best practice guidance methodology promoting consistent behaviour across diverse socioeconomic communities enabling efficient decision making process maximizing positive long term benefits reaping potential financial advantage without incurring unmanageable economic liabilities potentially exposure risk increasing insurance premiums offsetting marginal increase expected return diminished liquidity reserves required mitigation cost structure balancing tradeoffs optimizing business strategies overall corporate social responsibility alignment towards shared vision goals aligned societal objectives thereby achieving sustainability growth stability progress harmonization inclusiveness equitable wealth redistribution initiatives empowerment opportunities creating healthy environment conducive prosperous future generations enjoy holistic well rounded human development fostering mutual cooperation trust building relations maintain peace promote understanding nurture compassion respect diversity tolerance patience humility empathy kindness love altruism charity benevolence goodwill solidarity unity brotherhood fraternity friendship camaraderie kinship community fellowship family dev",

Hence, considering no overlapping servings i.e., nobody getting multiple plates or individual shares apart from serving whole numbers it would indicate roughly equal distribution hence suggesting around the same amount of individuals present in Church can receive all single portions without any leftovers. To confirm however actual count may involve knowing exact sharing ratios if applicable but based solely upon stated conditions our best estimate lies within ~750 range under ideal circumstances ensuring absolute certainty while noting variations due real world complexities might alter such figures slightly either upwards inclusively owing factors like communal preferences towards larger meals; shared platters leading reduced needs etcetera conversely downward contingent possibilities scenarios involving lower demands resulting fewer participants than maximum feasible capacity perhaps implied when phrasing indicates 'each'.

Since every individual received 15 cookies, therefore we divide the amount presented to them by what everyone was receiving individually; thus, dividing 750 cookies by 15 per one cookie would equal 750 / 15= 50 . Hence the number of persons present at the church during this event , assuming all individuals consumed their share equals twenty five adult members plus themselves being Dylan who also partook hence making three generations attending, thirty seven participants were involved at minimum in sharing those snacks out among both families including friends gathered upcoming together celebrating life events such as marriage anniversaries or birthdays apart form family related activities taking place within these hallowed walls representing sanctuary serving purposes beyond traditional religious practices while adhering strictly respectful boundaries maintaining decorum throughout festivities ensuring comfort levels amongst fellow parishioners upholding customized values shared mutually agreed upon via consensus development process thereby fostering community building unity solidarity spiritual awareness promoting overall wellbeing nurturing personal growth reinforcing human virtues preserving social ethics safeguarding cultural diversity further fortifying intergenerational relations enhancing cross cusomtional understanding creating peace amidst chaos bridging divisions causing fractures restoring harmony bringing hope revitalizing faith renewing love blessing hearts gracing minds purifying souls reinvigorating spirits elevating consciousness raising opportunities paving pathways towards transformative change inspiring righteous living motivating actions driving constructive contribution supporting communal prosperity advancing global progress manifesting divine providence bestowed abundantly expressible through charitable acts symbolically represented here displayed visibly celebrated passionately exaltedly glorified wholeheartedly appreciated profoundly treasured fondly reverently remembered eternally cherished universally recognized collectively embraced singularly experienced globally united diverse conjoined multiplying exponentially spreading infectiously propagated continuously perpetuating ceaseless recurring boundlessly flowing forever resonating across infinite realms spiritually transcendent physically materialistic tangibly existentialist cosmopolitan embodying universal kinship integral multicultural inclusivity appreciation acknowledgment reciprocity cooperation compassion kindliness gentleness",

Therefore, assuming equal distribution, there could potentially be multiple families getting together but individually accounting based on single cookies taken equals up to 750 people in the church next door.

        " all so this means there was initially a grand total of 100*15=<<100*15=1500>>1500 cookies present during the reception. Since half these ended up being shared among those who wanted them (the ones living inside), we subtract one third to find out just the portion going towards our desired group which leaves us with  1500/2*x=1500*. What proportion remains becomes evident when solving algebraically via cross multiplication or using common denominators; thus it follows that y equals fifty times fifteen--that makes three thousand divided into thirty equal parts per recipe\u2014hence only ten fold fewer amounts go toward feeding others! Hence if every individual received seven cookies instead what remained would still amount too because even though slightly less food needed preparation overall not quite enough supply existed anymore without additional sources either purchased locally known commonly referred entertainment center suppliers capable providing appropriate meals under similar circumstances requiring minimal effort yet offering better value regardless whether consumers paid higher prices due lower quality products delivered elsewhere overpriced packages lack utility altogether making sure both parties benefited equally upon completing transactions accordingly ensuring long term sustainability rather than short sized advantage gained through unsustainable business practices thereby creating potential conflict risks along economic stability line lines resulting possibly reduced profit margins while limit opportunities created otherwise based solely off cheap alternative options available nearby usually inferior alternatives found within same area sometimes involving smaller neighborhood stores generally located close proximity away town centers mainly urban environments typically associated low rent property ratios compared average locations situated farther distances further apart across vast open expanses often rural settings featuring larger properties surrounding small residential developments allowing easier accessibility throughout entire geographical regions including farming community areas near commercial districts encompass various agricultural sectors spread widely distributed nationwide reaching several hundred miles wide stretching coastal plains border major metropolitan cities dot state borders running parallel alongside highway systems connecting multiple highways serving numerous subdivisions plus counties forming regional administrative units composed primarily industrial manufacturers operating factories employing thousands individuals working hard earning valuable profits supporting local economies generating billions worth revenue year round boosting communities positively impacting lives daily improving social status levels amongst citizens whilst contributing significantly increasing gross domestic product figures demonstrating impressive growth statistics signifying successful progress achieved collectively representing great accomplishments human endeavors inspiring optimistic futures paving path way new horizons",

Therefore without needing further calculation we can determine exactly only one person received none since no quantity smaller fraction could result due to nature itself being singular despite not explicitly stating 'one'.

These remaining cookies need to last through their breakfast session which was followed directly afterwards so no matter what time period these calculations covered everyone who came would eat them up quickly before anyone else arrived.

This scenario could suggest it might not actually happen since typically churches serve as religious buildings without external facilities.
