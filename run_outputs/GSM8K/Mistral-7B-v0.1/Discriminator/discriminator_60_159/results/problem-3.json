Second_Half Amount Paid=(Regular Cost)-(Cost Reduction)(Second Half Payment)=$140-(0.1*$140)$=.$140-$14=$126$. Finally find annual payment using formula above.: Annual Subscription Fee=(First HALF)+(SECOND HALF PAYMENT) Yearly Total=$140*(6/12)+($126)*(3/12)Yearly Total=$70+$37.8Total Price:$107.80$.

Thus , over these second six months, the cost totals up to \\$\\(126*(6)=\\$756\\).

Again, as any six months pass so totals become 6*$126= $756. By adding both halves together one can easily reach their goal value:$840+$756 equals approximately $$1596 altogether . An approximate solution could also simply involve doubling because our time span exactly divides into quarters ,so taking either quarter times four yields similarly correct results about $_1596$. Thus you might say roughly$$2*($140)=~$280 for all twelve months..

Let me know if you need clarification on anything.. This problem setups up nicely using our standard formula ${\\text{(rate)} \\cdot {\\text{(time)}}={\\text{total}}$. To setup such problems effectively here are suggestions: Make sure when presenting word problems like these write down the variable definitions and known values based on context/explanation within story prior starting work... First thing would always check units make certain everything matches except currency ($$$). Always look specifically toward numbers regarding payments versus what those actually measure---it provides crucial insight needed early stage while solving algebra question involving financial matters related scenario including timeframe lengths(e.g.,month->year ). Also consider identifying change over specific intervals rather just focus primarily around calculations directly relating back initially provided quantities without breaking entire equation into parts allowing breakdown process easier understanding later stages completion towards solution derivation phase .. Another good technique employed includes drawing visual representations illustrative depictions relevant underlying information conveyance thereby reinforcing comprehensive grasp concepts presented alongside numerical computations utilized hence promoting clearer thought processes necessary navigating through complex mathematical scenarios requiring multi faceted analytical approaches beyond surface level simplistic arithmetic operations commonly observed often during traditional homework assignments encountered earlier educational journey thus encouraging creativity ingenuity development skills essential life long endeavors successful career growth progression paths followed professional pursuits undertaken regardless chosen vocational path adopted individual strive achieving personal fulfillment objectives desired amidst increasing societal expectations changing dynamic environment modern era demands adaptability versatility competent professionals skilled capable address challenges unique opportunities offered multifaceted global interconnectivity interface diverse cultures embracing diversity differences",
