        " has four times as many friends on Facebook as Dorothy. Since Charlies friend count can fit into these relationships, let\u2019s assume dorothys friend amount was one (as if you multiply it \u2013 either way results stay consistent), making charlies friendship seven , while james would accordingly show eighteen friends . But this doesn\u2019t seem correct based off our input data :D because only ten percent less than twelve would leave us with eleven which multiplied out wouldn\u2019t work consistently using any possible value I could come up witheven numbers.. However examining both options closely shows me when my math fails every second time here yet no matter what order those digits fall next everything else works perfectly fine except once again not counting ninety point anything since thats outside all realistic limits im working under hence eight hundred seventy six being the most accurate solution available although technically true numerically its impossible physically so therefore conclude accordingly below but keep mind whenever i say least please understand Im telling u something very specific due To maintaining standards such As provided And clarity Of writing/concept understanding Therefore concluding Here; ",
        " it says here explicitly this point; if Charlie (who has thrice) has 12 friends, that means twice that amount--Dorothy who\u2019s third friend --has half, meaning six friends. Again since you told me that Alex or John only knows one percent less than Chris, but still wants ten years older people like him known which equates us back into their original statement about wanting everyone over fifteen year old\u2014we can use these same calculations except substitute them based off those numbers instead making sure your math skills aren\u2019t compromised due to incorrect assumptions throughout all previous steps! Finally calculate out Jack ' s current situation according too what else was mentioned above so let us break down further : Firstly Jame needs no mention because Jessica currently holds seven hundred forty eight thousand plus twenty minus twelve equals seventy thirtyseven thousands\u2026 This last bit could refer either toward getting additional info regarding exactly just where anyone goes next time somebody asks concerning age groups along side population figures \u2013 therefore using both elements together would yield better results when figuring someone specific ages themselves rather trying narrowing things solelfily upon general estimates ; also note neither young nor middle aged individuals included unless stated elsewhere earlier within document itself..

        " and it's three times the amount Dorothy has (so let D represent Dorothy\u2019s count): C=D*3 --> substitute values into our equation : 12=(3)*(D). Solving reveals that Dorothy counts just under one friend -- if you divide both sides your result would not make any sense because social media platforms don't allow partial accounts \u2013 but since those who share their birthdays might choose not post photos or updates about them all year round resulting often zero followers/friends; therefore considering normal circumstances assume everyone having such profiles complete entries making us conclude 'approximate value'.

Thus Charles\u2019 social circle totals 12 but dorothy being smaller only gets about 1/3rd portion so holding same ratios meaning 3x lesser following the fact shared earlier james still keeps adding up even though having double amounts relative to Dorothy making him getting double shares plus another set therefore resulting overall amount coming upto twice folds thus leading us closer rounding off our calculations near enough arriving close to accurate count estimations hence concluding conclusion due to unavailability further precision levels needed extra info thereby suggesting absence possible values may also vary slight changes however keeping core underlying premises intact within reasonable scope remains pivotal factor ensuring integrity throughout discourse retainring initial assumptions paramount consider above cited points before proceeding forward aim validly establishes clear coherent understanding amongst peers enabling seamless flow smooth exchange robust dialogue while promoting positive growth interpersonal communication fostering healthy relationships amidst collective learning endeavor maintaining balance fair play equitable treatment essential conducive environments flourishing educational settings encourage critical thinking analysis deep exploration diverse perspectives appreciation varied viewpoints respectful dialog contributing significant value towards academic pursuits benefiting greater community knowledge base enhance intellectual capacity elevate societal welfare construct future leaders advocate change champion causes transform world betterment inspire innovation drive progress shape tomorrow brighter happier lives empower potential fulfill dreams actualize hopes embody vision courage hope resilience determination faith joy triumph achievement aspiration reality embodied reflection introspective evolution comprehensive approach synthesis integration multidisciplinary collaboration cross pollinating ideas generating novel concepts inventiveness propelling creative ingenuity fuel original thought spark genius breakthrough revelatory discoveries revolutionary advancements technological leap quantum computing theoretical physics artificial intelligence machine learning big data analytics neuroscience cognitive science psychology human behavior motivational dynamics emotional intelligence leadership development teamwork collaborative problem solving entrepreneurship finance economics strategic planning operational efficiency",

Anyways back onto my previous thoughts.
