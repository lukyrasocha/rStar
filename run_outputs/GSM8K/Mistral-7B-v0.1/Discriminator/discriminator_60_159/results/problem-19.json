To find what percentage was payable multiply one minus the reciprocal or complementary fraction (. Here again assume no sales tax.). Thus $.7*1=.7$.

One way to use fractions may help check your work when converting back into decimals later., Examples include; let B = dollar bill value needed including whatever %, excl disaster losses etc. And q = % wanted i.e.: desired rate.

Another issue concerns adding up quantities whose denominators aren \u2019t consistent \u2013\u2013 especially ones involving currencies foreign versus domestic exchange ratios among others! Remember always keep track along lines below whether anything changes during various steps!. Also watch out rounding numbers prematurely unless already rounded prior calculation stages thus causing misleading results.(For instance suppose my budget amounts varied significantly over several transactions occurring simultaneously hence necessitating precise figures within small intervals relative totals.)
