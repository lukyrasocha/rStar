Set up equations based upon information identified above using variables or numbers wherever appropriate (e.g., if we call \u2018x\u2019 as the amount given). To solve algebraically without additional info provided may lead us into guessing scenarios since it doesn\u2019t specify whether the unknown variable represents any particular value among possible values ($12+$10=$22) which leads down different paths than simply subtracting 8 from known costs because such simple subtraction cannot account when other conditions might apply beyond those basic figures mentioned.
