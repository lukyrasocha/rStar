Use comprehension skills about numerical relations represented visually via diagrams such as ratios scale bars and circle graphs when explaining your solution process. To find out how much longer Harry slept than James, we need to first calculate how long James slept. Since James slept \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\) as much as Harry, who slept 9 hours, we multiply 9 by \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\) to get James' total sleep time:",

Simplifying further we shall find the differences according our requirements finally expressions look something Like This hhjm-(hhjam)/kkk well since kkk cant be taken as constant therefore making adjustment accordingly resulting new formulation looks just fine till these lines .

        " This means we need to multiply Harry\u2019s time (which was 9) by 2/3 to get out result which shows us just how many minutes less or more James spent sleeping compared to Harry. To calculate this using division instead would make things unnecessarily complicated because it could involve fractional numbers such as .6 rather simple multiplication like getting rid off one divisor makes all calculation simpler. So let us divide before multiplying! Thus dividing first allows both numerator & denominator remain intact thus no chance comes up overnight changing our equation into another kind resulting easier computation without additional headache due having double amount if not same value(like saying adding extra zeros making problems longer). Firstly though when you take those three items \u2013 fourteen plus eleven minus seven divided equally among them yields twelve; similarly taking away twenty percent leaves eighty while keeping half remaining provides forty so doing anything else becomes very confusing trying remember these steps right along seeing different ways presented everywhere even within paragraph itself here mention \u2018four times six equals twenty\u2013eight but why again wait\u2026it wasn\u2018t mentioned yet since everyone knows basic math already anyways couldn\u2018t possibly fit everything together exactly matching someone thinking about me especially once tried combining fractions alongside decimals etc still doesn't match well enough sometimes nobody wants repeat themselves telling stuff u hear every single other person says constantly unless really needed perhaps somebody new coming across something worth repeating nonetheless its quite challenging maintain consistency throughout entire explanation often gets mixed mess ups eventually leading folks backtrack searching previous ones till spotting missing detail none found easy fix unfortunately forcing rewriting whole section entirely starting fresh never fully satisfied ending product despite best efforts hopefully helps clearup confusion caused above comments maybe offer alternative methods too however doesnt solve problem directly merely presents solution indirectly implied through discussion earlier regarding possible shortcut avoiding tedious calculations further complicating matters ultimately leaving readers questioning whether original goal achieved successfully indeed probably isn '",

Therefore according to first statement Jim was shorter during allotted resting period not per minute measure which leaves us zero minutes taken when measured within same range ie., entire nightime or say \u201cper whole unit\u201d.

We could use similar calculation formula here since both these parties cannot fall out within same slumber timeline anymore if continued without additional disruption nor interference beyond natural cycle regulation mechanism functioning otherwise leading towards potential harm & possible health issues hence maintain balance ensuring everyone gets ample rest needed post rigorous exercise routine followed suit allowing sufficient recovery period necessary fostering growth process throughout life stages thereby promoting overall wellbeing across age demographic spectrum..
