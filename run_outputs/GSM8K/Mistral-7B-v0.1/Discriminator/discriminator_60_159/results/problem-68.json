Four watermelons would equal the quantity 4 multiplied by their price which equals `4(3x)`; twenty peppers sold at the rate `$15` per piece mean we multiply its value (`$`) by the count `(20*15)`. Ten oranges means ten such fruits hence our formula becomes `(3x)*4+(20*15)+((3x)-5)(10)`. Since it was mentioned one pepper equalled `$15`; this implies you can replace all instances of 'the unit size\" with '$15'.

        " watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs.

Given that every single orange equates fifteen dollars minus 5 hence, this amounts to  15$-5=$10$, therefore; twenty such fruits will cost him    10$per fruit*$20fruites=$200.$ As said earlier each pepper comes across thirty dollars so let us multiply its value per piece i.e.,   30$/peaches$\\times$$20peches=$600$. Let\u2019s add them together because these figures represent everything else apartfrom the fourth line above summing up into : $600+180+$200 ,which computes downwardsinto     1080$.

        " that an orange costs 5 cents less than a watermelon so this means it would be worth forty four dollar fifty (i.e., $45-$5=$44). Calculate firstly the overall cost of all these melons/peppers combinations you want to purchase together which include: Four Watermelons, Ten Oranges and Twenty Peppers altogether meaning; Cost=((Watermelon)*(Number_of_watermelons))+(Orange*number_oranges)+ ((Pepper*Number_of_peppers)). This equates into; Total_cost=(($45)(Four Melons+Ten Oranges))+$ [( ($15) X Number_Of_Peppers)] . Therefore your calculation becomes:$[(4x$45)+(10 x $(45-(5))]   [We used \"$\" sign since our question was centered around currency]    $[180]+[390]= $570This implies , when combining both fruits prices i.e.; one quarter of apple price plus half banana per kg equals twenty seven point something rupees..

Ascertain the overall purchasing fee needed for twenty units of pepperlings plus ten oranges combined together. Remembering that one unit of Pepperling equals fifty cents ((peppertyper)*(fifty centers)) so getting 20 quantities of them brings up to (.((.(half)),^.^.), i.e.,(.((.^^)(/&)).
