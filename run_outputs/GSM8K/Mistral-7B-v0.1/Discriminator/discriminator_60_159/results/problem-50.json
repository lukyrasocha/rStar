Finally, divide this sum by 2 since we want the average per person. Therefore, it amounts to being approximately 90 / 2= 45.

        " how many fruit roll-ups each person received before averaging them. Assuming one row contains only single rows (i.e., width), Beatrice would receive 2x24=48 units since it's specified per line; meanwhile, Marcell receives 3x14 which equals 42 units. Summing these together gives us 48+42=90 fruit roll-ups altogether. To get the average consumption, divide this quantity by 2 (the number of people) hence resulting into an average of 90/2 or 45 fruit roll-ups consumed each individually. Therefore, according to your question about 'how many did they EAT ON AVG', taking individual counts out isn\u2019t required because you asked explicitly \u2018average'.

But since you cannot split half a unit without context suggesting additional numbers elsewhere such maybe rounds down meaning together they consume thirty six((six whole units plus ten over twelve)) when rounded correctly considering real world situations like partial consumption(pieces). Here though rounding seems less appropriate compared other cases due lack supporting data towards fractional quantities resulting choice would favour closest lower integer value avoiding ambiguity thus keeping only complete counts ensuring simplicity hence preferred option being said 'twenty eight'.
