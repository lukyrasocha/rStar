Calculate the proportion of these girls who aren't part of the Girl Scouts using the fraction provided above(i.e., 1/3 because it indicates those not enrolled while 'those' here refers to all remaining half which makes up one) . Therefore , perform this calculation based off proportions; take the obtained quantity from earlier ((the sum of  200 - [200*(2 / 5)])) divided by three since you know that twice outta every thirty would constitute your target group i.e,.
