With Sylvie sticking around another quarter decade, it means one increase would occur next year making her new earnings come out to $7,200 * 1.1= $7,920. Another addition following suit takes this further into $7,920*1.1=$8,712.

By considering such proportionate timing intervals alongside respective payment periods while dealing directly via proportions instead than fractions whenever feasible makes solving similar problems involving proportional changes relatively straightforward; therefore employing such mathematical reasoning strategies allows tackling complex arithmetic operations effortlessly without getting bogged down deep within numerical minutiae especially related towards fractional division processes often encountered during simpler linear equations based solution procedures otherwise common amongst most secondary school curricula across various levels including international syllabi like IB Paper C/ Mathematics & Further Mathematics examination settings too .

Therefore if we take this percentage into account, the new rate becomes ($7200+$720) or ($7920). This process gets repeated overtime as stated within the question. It clearly outlines increases happening twice since no one else said otherwise. Calculate the second consecutive raise using similar steps above. As such applying the formula described earlier once again($7920*$10 / 100)+$792=($862), therefore bringing us towards getting our third instance $(862+10)/100=$19+(862+19)=($921)$. Consequently the next adjustment occurs resulting in yet another revision leading them to finally come up with a sum totalling approximately $(921*(10/100))+$921=(~$1.6x) (+$(921+~$1.6x)= ~($923).
