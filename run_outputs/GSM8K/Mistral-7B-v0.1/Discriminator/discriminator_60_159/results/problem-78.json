Since we know both tests consist of different numbers of questions (first being 75) but lasting half as long time (as stated 8 hours vs 6), divide initial amount by smaller portion which yields him expected output/questions answered while following this speed over shorter period. This means within those extra available periods additional question attempts get less attention because concentration decreases so only whole portions count towards success even though fractional amounts may exist mathematically under ideal conditions otherwise possible! As such results show; although calculations reveal fractions indeed present here still real life situation mandate round up downwards thus affecting true reality score calculation accordingly.-Total ",

This means when calculating our target output figures (number_of_questions_complete), instead of performing explicit arithmetic operations involving seconds or individual ratios within mentioned periodical durations during these tasks(which could complicate things due to their varying length across different stages).
