        " one gallon ($3) by fourteen hundredth (.2). To get $0.60 (cashback reward). Calculate the price paid before subtracting any savings due to discounts or gifts. This calculation equals thirty dollars ((($3/gallon)(10 gallons)=$30)). Subtract the combined value saved through .2 off every dollar spent. [(Total Price Paid)-(Cents Saved)]= Total Cost With Cash Back Rewards From Gas Purchase. When these calculations meet we find out it costs $(30-$6) which simplifies as $$24.. Your answer should equal exactly twentyfour.(final_answer): \\$24",
        " without any discount would simply equal (cost_per_gallon) times (num_gallons). This equals ($3/gasoline)*(10 gallons)=$30 . To calculate cash back reward; multiply num_of_gallons again but using rate_cashback as denominator instead of numerator which means (.20/1)(10 gas) so here it simplifies to just having ten over twenty or one half because only dollar value matters when considering such problems.\r Hence our savings due to offer stands equivalent $(30)/(.5) ===>=$60 But remember initially all these happened within a context i mean before calculation was initiated.. therefore , what ultimately remains true & useful towards solving initial query itself ..is merely realization that overall spending becomes less expensive thanks too additional rebate received outright making purchasing cheaper thus showing us difference via comparison methodology thereby illustrating change made effective saving gained effecting price drop....so henceforth remaining balance shall read :: **after subtracting both expenses directly** :=($30)-($60) --> result=-(-)$30 ; simplified results into positive monetary gain indicating benefit obtained through applied deal conditions etc provided involved parties accept terms stated clearly across exchange interface during process involving actual transaction execution taking place simultaneously while observing adherence rules defined governing same relationship establishment under relevant legal jurisdiction.....therefore conclusion reached congruent alignment wtih desired output sought !!!

        " instance, it would be $.20 less than the original price ($3.00). This means every dollar spent yields .80 worth (.20 back) or alternatively said $\\$ \\frac{1}{1} -\\frac{20 }{100}=\\$ .8$. Thus multiply the result above which equals about $.8* \\$1=$ .8 times the quantity representing purchases (since all units need not necessarily equate; here only one unit was sold--a single purchase transaction), yielding just under $8 as savings/net value. Finally determine net expenditure through addition---expenses equal initial spending minus return obtained via rebate offerings ($\\$30-\\$8=\\$\\boxed{\\,\\text{(}2}\\,)\\overline{\\,\\,\\text{)}=}\\,\\,$) We can subtract because both terms involve monetary values (currency); likewise additions work when dealing with quantities whose shared measurement systems permit direct calculation across those measurements..
