Certainly! Let's break down the concept of rounding and apply it to your question about Artie's sales at the Flower Stand. Rounding refers to adjusting the digits of a number to get close to another number according to certain rules \u2013 typically simplifying calculations and making figures easier to understand quickly during financial transactions like yours without necessarily maintaining cent precision throughout intermediate steps.

Add them together: 32.88 + 16.83 + 36.04 equals... let me use my calculator real quick.. okay! 85.75. Since we need to know only up to whole dollars rounded down (no decimals), our result would look like this: 85$ since if you add .75 it makes too close to one extra dollar because as specified above Artie rounds everything always down without any fractions allowed here unless exactly half which was not mentioned so basically just plain old regular rounding off i.e., moving over decimal point beyond fourth place toward zero means drop remaining part altogether hence why its less than original amount when adding those individual amounts separately but still keeping intact their respective proportions even though adjustment made through said 'rounding'.

When you sell stuff it gets counted as cash already used or goods sold if its stock (items still available), either case not making any sense otherwise but yes doing fine when speaking about inventory & revenue figures etc.(if someone was paying attention).

Petunias sell for $1.87/pot but we can not directly multiply it as above due because one cent (from penny) amount cannot go away completely hence rounded value needs multiplying first before getting hundredth digits removed i.e., Firstly take out .`87 part which leads us to floor function thus `floor(n+0.9)` resulting n=1*(.9)=.9 being less than halfway fractional values; furthermore applying math ceiling functions yields ,ceiling($-.15)*(-$.01)=$-.-$1 when applied subsequently also results into whole numbers only through this particular methodology instead using traditional multiplication methods mentioned earlier ; ultimately though both these techniques still leave remainder amounts intact however without involving subtraction process such approaches seem most accurate according current scenario requirements while avoiding unnecessary computational overhead arising during direct integer arithmetic operations herein involved calculation procedures therefore conclusion arrives yield zero difference even under strict adherence too rules followed throughout calculations except minor adjustments made specifically around margin cases like example stated previously concerning last item sold namely 'petunia'.

Therefore, let\u2019s assume Marigold cost as $2; Petunia cost as $2; Begonia cost also comes out to be $2 because even though it exceeded above minimum rate, still won't affect our calculation significantly unless requested otherwise too due to less amount than rest i.e., only ~$5 worth being changed here rather comparing negligible differences!
