Later this year their combined increases amount to ($(a+b)$)-$(a$+$b$) times twenty because when both received raises , so $(A^{n}+B^{n})^r-(AB)^r$, r here representing \u201cyears\u201d becomes ten. This leads to us having these formulas:(28k+$3k)(c k represents thousand)=($40K+$x)*3=(112k). Solving yields c= 0.2 or twenty percent.(112k/28k=.2)+.$1k*(both plus forty), adding lyathas raise results into thirty thousand one hundred eighty dollars,($.2*$112K+(LYLAREVISED SALARY))and ((ADRIEN REVIESED)+lyalas revised),(($/.4*$$112K)/(.3*.1*)<..the current sum together amounts totalling )too.*thirteen three thousand six hundreds eleven dollars exactly.

To find out the value , let us solve these equations together : Let lyla_salary represent Lylah\u2019s earlier annual income when it compares against adrian's initial one, so get equation -> `lyla_salary=(adrian_initial_earnings-$adrian_year_onward_increase).eq` We can easily compute => `$adrians_{previous\\_annual}`, being equal to `$40000.` From above calculation, lets plug everything into first set up expression; thus forming :: `(adrian_year_after)->(lyala_now)` becomes $(25+y)=(175+(lya)`. Here lies our second relationship comparing against this formula..and finally solving both expressions provides ==> **Lyala currently receives ($28500 annually.)** Combining everyone again brings you back here ..we know:`('Adair')_(four__years_later)`,(`='$(final)_totals`) but wait! Our problem wants (*)(Total Salaries received _Four Years Later*) not merely Adair alone . Hence::*(adair + adaptatoloalLYLA)' ===> '$44500`.

Firstly identify his past base percentage change or raise rate= ((New salary/Oldsalary)-1) Which translates into ; Past Raise Rate=(($52000/$40000)-1)= 0.3(i.e.;  30%). Second factor being next hike : Next Hike Value = oldValue*(1+rate); Therefore ,Next Sale Hikers Value=$52000*((1+40%)) ($52000*1.4=$72800 . Similarly calculating Lyahtas present position if their previous situation happened parallelly hence similarly raising her payment equally leading upwards its current worth$x+(y)$ & $(Y=.05)*X$.

Given this information along with Adam being paid specifically  40k$, you can find out Loretta's paycheck as follows :(($40000/1.7)*0.7=$17059approx.)
