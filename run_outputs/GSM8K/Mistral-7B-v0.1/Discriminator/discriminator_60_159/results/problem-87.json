Finally, according to our information above twice as many flew out again so twenty-one times fifty minutes was needed or equivalent sixty seconds. Therefore I could infer what happened during these few moments when everything else changed direction just briefly due to weather changes while outside flying around waiting until nature found its way toward comfortably resting locations near homes filled mostly with food supplies like plants grown inside houses etc..
