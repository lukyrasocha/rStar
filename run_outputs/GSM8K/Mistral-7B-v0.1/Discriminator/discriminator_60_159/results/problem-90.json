Doing this calculation we find Steve takes about `3*5280/440= 36 minutes` and Tim spends roughly `2*5280/264 =~ 41 minutes`. Therefore taking difference shows steve wins but needs wait till tim arrives which makes it around `(41-(total_speed(T)-winning_time))`, here winning means reaching less quickly among those; thus when using our calculated values put them together gets us `${(41 -(440*(3+x) /264)} =$ {$(5/(44*5)+((x)*(6)))}  \u2248{($(41-(1320/x) )}={-4}$approximately.` Thus putting numbers back solves itself showing $(x) ~~$-3 , hence subtracting $-3 \\approx \\$ 3\\minutes$.

Let us calculate both time taken using Speed=Distance/Time formula rearranged as Time = Distance /Speed; hence it comes down to find out whether Tim completes the game first or not i.e., less wait time since he takes shorter route compared to Steven whose path was longer thus considering equal routes could lead tim being slower but faster if he covers same paths making him win having lower duration spend even when covering larger area due to higher speeds causing overall smaller interval spent.

And also note here using similar conversion method one could find out ratios amongst various forms too! When considering both competitors 'bikers', these calculations need not only involve average velocity alone nor simply assume constant motion throughout full journey length either.. rather factor acceleration upon starting plus deceleration upon reaching destination alongside terrain conditions affecting momentum transfer across different intervals during trips itself !

Since Speed(Bike) / Time=Distance we calculate time using following equation;Time=(Speed* Distance )/ FPS,(FPS stands for Feet Per Second). We plug our numbers into this formula as follows ;Time=(440 ft/minute)*(15840feet)/(3ft per second)= 2.3 hours=. This means Steve gets back home ~ 175 minutes or approx~2hours & 55 mins later.(Remembering here also converting Miles to Feet since unit consistency matters when doing calculations.)Next identify if Stevs\u2019 wife leaves earlier : As per question \u2018how long would someone wait.\u2019 It doesn\u2019t say anything about whether Tim actually starts biking while Steve still waits outside.So assume both people take off immediately once arriving at School meaning ,no delay hence just need compare timings. Next convert speeds:- Timmy Rides Skateboards @264ftph Convert them all units same way i was trying above.;Timmys Ride_speed:(Skateboard)(FeetperMinute)Convert Speeds :- Bikespeed@(Wheels)_Per_(Seconds);Bikespeed: [From]miles[To]:meters::Wheel circumference:(Radius)=Pi*(Diameter):dollars:(Cents),so...Now finally solve!!!We know From Docs,- Mike goes faster than Timmie.- Hence one person wins..But WHO ? Calculations below help us determine this.<jupyter_code>%%latex",
        " distance travelled in feet (since our speed values use 'feet', not 'miles'). Each mile contains about 5280 ft., thus we multiply this value times three which yields around 15,840ft. Divide this amount over Steves biking velocity equating us to approximately 35 minutes until reaching destination as compared against tim\u2019s wait time. Similarly calculating Tim , it takes him roughly similar duration. Here both players reach simultaneously without any winning/losing status thereby implying no one waits but rather reaches concurrently because distances converted into respective units yield identical durations due to equivalent ratios reflective within original statement construct.

        " equal to (3*5280)ft= [15,840 ft]. As we know that Steve bikes around twice as fast as Tim rides his scooter, calculate time required to complete this journey based upon these facts. Time taken would thus stand out like this : ([distance]/(speed)) or in our case it stands out like => (15,840/440)=approx=36 minutes. Meanwhile ,Tim live only upto 2 miles . Doing similar calculations shows us that Tim takes (((([time]*(miles))) / [(feetperminute)]),(approximately),that looks something like --> (([[Time]]*(2x5280)/[(264)*Minutes]))=(~ [[30]]) approx ~~~it takes him about half the amount if steves time to reach home..Finish line calculation therefore comes down into one simple comparison statement....if tim gets back first then timing says roughly   -->[half hours ----> **30 minuts** ] difference-->>so finally winners wait approximately thirty four minutes !!.[",
        " to reach his home; calculate this as (Distance) divided by (Speed), which equals about 6 minutes . While Steven arrives first , We need to find out when Tom reaches home while riding Skates ; His speed was also provided above, again calculated using Distance/speed formula equaling approximately  8 minutes . But since we don't want time difference here, just duration till both friends reached homemessages take same starting point & ending place.. Since one person starts earlier but ends later means everyone else still hasn't finished yet! ",
        " 440 feet/minute which equals approximately 6 minutes (it\u2019s easier if you convert all measurements into consistent units). Let's calculate what happens to Tim while Steven bikes back towards him . As we saw earlier ,   Tim also rides his scooter across three miles every trip too. His round trips take longer because during the first part when he waits for Steve(i.e., six whole minutes)and gets delayed till Steve returns again; This would make tim slower overall even though both boys reach schools simultaneously since shes faster.. And here comes our interesting point : let ' s imagine them racing as soon possible just right afterwards ! We know speed matters but not distances covered within these specific intervals mentioned above nor any other details surrounding them apart form knowing about individual paces only hence leaving us unable deduce anything else valuable without taking several factors like weather conditions outside etc together along side those provided initially... Which basically means whosoever reaches second most quickly wins instead meaning everyone except perhaps one guy ending up arriving third latest possibly due changing circumstances involving external elements such wind direction changes happening intermittently affect performance otherwise constant speeds remain stable thus making timing relevant rather fixed throughout races regardless whether people involved actually change pace midway through events occurring continuously\u2026 However considering everything stated previously seems fairly reasonable looking ahead ; especially once taken account varying scenarios presented alongside initial assumptions thereby explaining logic behind outcome chosen ultimately! That being said therefore lets figure out exact moment differences required using below formulaic approach :- Difference Between Two Times Taken To Complete Task X First Time Less Than Second By Y Minutes Exact "
