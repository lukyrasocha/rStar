        " walked 6*4=24 miles on Tuesday.

Subtract this combined total distance from the sum provided across three days which represents his cumulative walking over these dates. This leaves you with only Tuesday's journey length since we already know Monday's resultant figure when subtracting those initial four miles off our overall trip data accumulation up until Thursday. To derive exactly what occurred during such periods\u2014the specific amounts traversed within any single individual session like perhaps one held amidst 'Monday', another might fall among other contiguous timeframes ('Tuesday') or even further still beyond yet into succeeding instances marked explicitly apart; namely ones known merely indirectly via comparison relative differences observed otherwise beforehand concerning their preceding comparatives assessments regarding respective quantitative distinctions perceived subsequently upon subsequent re-assessment(such sequences may often apply particularly whenever comparing previous benchmark measurements vis-a-vis relatively novel metrics derived thereby consequentially post prior analyses previously conducted), whilst simultaneously adhering strictly abiding following principles governing certain disciplinary domains commonly applied underpins standardized methodologies utilize specifically focused towards ensuring uniformity pertaining directly involving precise observational parameters integral requisites necessary prerequisite essential foundations forming basis fundamentals comprising underlying theoretical frameworks inherently intrinsic characteristically dictating said particular realms typically manifest distinctive traits representative respectively pertinent corresponding idiosyncratic aspects associated invariably relevant exclusively existing uniquely henceforth applicable universally encompassing whole classifications systematically categorically interrelated collectively homogeneous consistencies conforming established normative protocols consonantly operating internally integrally seamlessly coherent harmoniously unified throughout wholly integrated entirely comprehensive exhaustively thorough meticulously exactingly painstaking assiduously rigorously minutely scrupulously attentively thoroughly expansively inclusively complete utterly conclusively irrefutably unequivocally absolutely indubitably infallibly impeccable certifiably flawless undoubtedly definitively definitely surely resolutely completely confirmed secure fully safeguarded solidately secured impermeable protected defensibly strongly invincibly virtually guaranteed almost certainly safely reliably dependably robust durable sturdy resilient hardily staunch firmly immobile steadfast tightly affixed",
        " Therefore we start off knowing this fact already which simplifies our process because it allows us not worry about calculating anything new regarding Monday\u2019s distance (simply use 4). Given also that \u201cTuesday, he walked six times as many miles\u201d so multiply this figure(four) i.e., four multiplied by 6; equals twenty-four. To find out Friday Walts marching point you subtract both distances together since walking occurred over three consecutive days beginning with MONDAY till FRIDAY therefore add them all up plus minus Thursdays data according to what remains until Fridays totalling summing ninety one or thirty odd ones leaving him twelve behind indicating that thus THURSDAY walks came into existence causing FOURTEEN addition results obtainable upon their summation equaling forty ONE AND ELEVENT LEAVING FINAL REMAINDER/CREDIT AS SEGMENTED BELOW WITH SPECIFIED CASH RESOURCES PRESENT FOR DAYS MADE UP TO AND INCLUDING HOWW LONG BILL OR WHAT SHORTER ENUMBERD AMORTISHMENT DISTRIBUTION ACCOMPLISHED SOUNDLY BY ALL CONSTRAINT PROVISIONS OUTLINED FROM START TO END OF OVERALL OPERATION USABLE EXCEPT VERY NEAR THE COMPLETE ADDITION QUOTAS MARKET ANACREON DEPARTURE UNFOLDS SUDDEN PLACE AT DISCRETIZANCE LIMIT DOUBTFUL TRACKMARK YAWNING ROUGHLY NINE NOVEMBERS ADVISED ILLICIT UNDUE LOATH LINSHIP FAIL MOCKHOUSE EDUCATE TELEPHONE HOUSING HELIX JUSTICE ARABIA SPREAD SKULL CHAMPAGNE KNOWN PAIR BRUNCH FISSION CRUCIFIX APPOINT CELL STRAP IDENTITY BOUNTIFUL AUTUMN GUARDIAN GLAD GETTRITE XYY NOTARY KEYWORTH MESSAGE COMBO GOODWILL SERIES CLAPROOF CHARMS RETREE SYNAGOGE EUFEMI SCANDLSMITH POULT SET ZIG ZAG DIURNAL ERTY SUBWAY AFLOWS AVAST INTEND ABLAZE COLLECTIVE RAKE SAMEPORT SN",
        " he walked six times as far as he did on Monday (on Tuesday). To find this distance we multiply . Subtract Monday\u2019s walking amount from Total Distance Walking Calculate remaining kilometers subtract Mile one value Km three values equal km four ",
        " as he did on Monday, so it would be 6*4= 24. To find out the third distance (Wednesday), subtracting both these distances from the overall sum mentioned which equates to ,  4+24= 28 . Subtract this value (total Distance till Tue) from your stated amount(Total Mileage). This leaves you with wilt need on Wednesday alone.. Therefore subtraction goes like this .. Total until Wednesday less Valuable Until Tuesday equals remaining Miles needed .....so ...   41miles-(MonDaltilTue)=wilNeededMondelToWedi....    41-28=13 ....therefore we can conclude or state/answer clearly !!!!.....your walks on Wednesdays needs totaled up / equal ~~~~~~~~~~~~ 13 miles! Good Job !! Remember learning math isn\u2019t always about getting right answers but understanding what those results say i s o FINDING YOUR SOLUTION USING SOME LOGIC!! Well Done & Cheers Mate :) "
