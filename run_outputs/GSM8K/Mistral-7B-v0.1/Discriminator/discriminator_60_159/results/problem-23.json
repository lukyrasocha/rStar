This yields you one hundred sixty (= seventyfivexeight.=fiftyfoursquared.). But wait! You only need six four squares because we subtracting fortyseventhirty sevens.(we don;t want any duplicate sets)(if i missed anything please let me know!)

        " 25 roses so 3*25=<<3*25=75>>75 roses altogether. Dan\u2019d multiply this result times the amount of thorns each one contains i.e., per rosemas (which I assume). That would mean multiplying 75*(each roseta having) or equivalently;  75*8 which totals up to be 75*8= <<75*8=600>>600 Thorn count overall! Hence ",
        " This means there are also 75 instances when we need multiply another factor (number of thorn per every single one). Therefore multiplying all together would look like this:  3*25*8=600    ",
        " thorns per rose. You find this multiplied product because every single rose (even if it doesn\u2019t look like one) needs those spiky things called \u201cthorn\u201d which can hurt you pretty badly IMO! And since we already figured out our previous multiplication problem earlier \u2013 remember what happened when numbers go into exponents using ^ signs before them right?. Those nasty little pricks cause me nothing but trouble during summer visits or picnics under palm shade away from sunshine & sandcastles\u2026 Well let us proceed further here onto calculating exactly HOW MUCH TOTAL NUMBER OF THORNS IS INVOLVED WITHIN THE PRESENCE/PARTICIPATION AND EXPERIMENTS BY DANCE LOVER WHO CUTTINGDONEALLOFMIDDEWISHSAZULLETTUNESBECAUSESHELOVEPOPSOUNDBUSINESSPROVIDINGHERTHEMANGASWORDSFROMMEQUILITYTOYOUANDWHATMANYDIRECTLYCITEFRIENDDOMINIKARRESTROLLRONGEMPATHIESOBSEQUENCEINTERVALEXACTLIKEABURNINAMAZEMENTTIMETABLEFORDAINTAFULLTEAMTAKETOGETTRICEPTIONANDGOALSYOUTHSURGIVENVIOUSNECCESSIBILITIESRANGEDCONNECTIONACCESSCOUPLEDWITHNOTSCRAMBILEPLACEWEEEEYYYYYY!!!!!
