However, this won't cover any additional services or fees provided as part of their contract -- which was not addressed explicitly here. Suppose we consider just basic supply coverage; without adding other earning aspects like service charges / overtime etc., assuming all future transactions generate similar revenue streams minus operating expenses such as supplier costs mentioned above let us assume uniform pricing schemes across new ventures too would remain constant hence allowing comparative analysis based solely upon direct sales figures extracted earlier .
