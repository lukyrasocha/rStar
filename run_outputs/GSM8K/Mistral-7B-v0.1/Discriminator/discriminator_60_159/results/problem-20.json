Calculate if any other people consumed part of this literacy (as it was not mentioned), just use what you identified previously, thus calculate firstly whether those who received their share exhausted or overran all parts without consuming extra than needed.) Thus sum up both amounts obtained above i.e., add together volumes received individually ->  4 L(girl)+6L+(boy)=10 Litres) subtract resulting volume used overall from initial Volume available-> Initial Quantity= Total capacity \u2013 Consumption quantity => Remaining Water Volumes=(Initial Volume)-Total consumptionQuantities=>RemainingWaterVolumes\u2009=\u2009|~InitialVolume \u2014 ~Consumed_quantity |Calculation Resulting value\u200a==\u202f\u200b24Liter\u2009\u2013\u200910 Liter\uf02d\u2014\u2009\u2193\u219214 LitreConcluding ",

        " 14 liters were taken. This leaves us with 24 - 14 liters remaining which equals to 10 liters. Therefore, there are still 10 liters of water available. The answer is: 10.",
        " available freshwater as X (in billions of gallons). Calculate its depletion rate per year due to agricultural use over Y years resulting in Z% decrease using D=((X*Z)/Y)*100 formula. Find if this change affected human consumption patterns based off these facts presented: Fact one states 'after increasing global temperatures,' fact three implies farming efficiency declined; both contribute to higher demand'. Discuss potential strategies such areas could employ ('rainwater harvesting', mention it) considering scarcity impact like increased cost or possible conflicts arising among users leading up until current data point indicating escalated prices amidst growing needs despite innovations aiming toward sustainability but facing implementation challenges especially under scenarios including drought frequency rise postulated.'

Hence, you get groups representing fractions like this (since it doesn\u2019t specify what fraction exactly belongs who), which would look something similar to |<--->|.<-->|| ||.. but not quite because our first part implies dividing equally among three people thus implying either two or three breaks here respectively while your example seemed four breaks as if divided amongst six places i suppose...So let me attempt once again clarifying my method using correct visualization please forgive me ^^\""
