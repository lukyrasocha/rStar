They also tell us their sales add up together to make eighty-eight thousand forty; h+m= 88,000 Which means substituting into our equation becomes h+(10*h)= 88,000 Combine this to get 11*(harald\u2019s rec.) equals 88,000 When divided out both sides become just 8 per recording.

Anyway herewith my attempt towards clarity though please provide additional details .. Good luck !! ",
        " so we get this equation M/10 (M) + M(H)=total. It equals  88000= M/10+M. Since M would stand out here I multiply every term by ten before solving which makes getting rid off common denominators easier like when you solve simultaneous equations. We therefore find that H*11m^2 =880000 . And divide both sides by m^2 ,which shows us its value. This results in h multiplied against something greater than zero meaning nothing can result other than positive integers or whole numbers resulting inthe same way i am expecting them since cant count partial quantities if selling items eg records etc\u2026 ",

        " if we say H represents the number of records Harald sold, then M (the number of records Marilyn sold) would equal 10H. We know together their sales totaled 88,000, or M + H = 88,000. Replacing 'M', which equals ten times of whatever number represented 'H,' brings us to this equation: 10H+H=88000 => 11H=88000. Dividing both sides of our resulting expression by 11 allows us to solve directly for H -> H=88000/11 ~\u2248 8000. Thus, it can be concluded that Harald recorded around 8,000 albums during his debut year according to these calculations. It is important here again to stress the fact about approximations because while using such mathematical tools like fractions might lead you closer towards exactness under controlled conditions; human factors always involve slight deviations due mainly to miscalculations & rounding off errors among others reasons.
