        " of his three children so this means there would be 2*3= <<2*3=6>>6 pairs of shoes being purchased overall. Calculate the amount paid per pair which was said as sixty (sixty) but it doesn\u2019t specify whether these sixty represents thirty dollars or sixy dollars so let\u2019s assume its not relevant here because we already know what price he pays per shoe(pairs). As such calculate outstanding costs assuming one unit equals twenty dollars hence multiply units times respective prices resulting into forty eight hundred ((six)*twenty)=forty eight hundreds (=480) . But since selling rate depends upon sellers preferences; therefore either could work depending whom you ask about who determines rates thus conclude four thousand dollars((two)+four)[$8]+($1)(three)&($16)=$(one)$[ten]=$[(eleven)]+zero+$[$eight]=seven cents$. Thus multiplying seven over twelve yields ten percent thereby implicating seventeen point zero plus another percentage based variable called markup i suppose equalling approximately eighteen if my math holds true.. Which makes up most part needed answers involving quantities related solely around profit margins without factoring any potential loss experienced during production processes/etc.; however using current standard models used within industry sectors provides roughly estimated figures showing ranges close enough toward accurate results via multiplication methods applied above whilst keeping track backwards towards specific numerical values obtained earlier shown through similar approaches utilized throughout numerous business calculations relating directly back onto real life examples found inside markets themselves!

        " $60 per child or (2*60)x(3)=$360 overall. But this isn\u2019t one of the choices listed above so we need check our calculations again. His kids buy three shoe sets at sixy dollars apiece right... Well I multiplied it wrong instead i needed to multiply like John buys two for every kid meaning its not ($60)*(2)+($60)(another set), but only once which equals ($60)\u00d7(2+1). Therefore ((60) \u00d7 (3))=180 dollars was spent.. That means your original calculation would work if you asked \u201cHow many dollar bills could equal all those prices?\u201d However what really matters here when finding out their individual amount due to these kinds of problems being word equations asking us about quantity rather than value/amount; hence why Im saying im sure most people just say \"$\" because nobody wants too break down everything into small parts\u2026 BUT FOR HOPE AND KNOWLEDGE UNDERSTANDING WILL COME FROM READING THIS QUESTION OVER AS NOW!
