        " minutes/unit equals 140 minutes or about 2 hours and 20 minutes. Therefore, it would take approximately two hours twenty minutes (or precisely twelve point four ten) to completely cover the length of the town. Conclusion: One hundred forty minutes if not rounded off; Two Hours Twenty Minutes when converted back into regular speech as mentioned above. But considering decimal points too strictly we could also say 'twelve point Four Ten', still being essentially equal but allowing even smaller fractions instead of rounding up towards the next full minute). Hence depending upon whether you prefer exact calculation using decimals rather than approximations through truncation , these can serve both purposes albeit subtle differences exist .
