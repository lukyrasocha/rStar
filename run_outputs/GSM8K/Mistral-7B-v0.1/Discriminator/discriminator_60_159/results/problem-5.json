What was wrong about calculating speed directly instead of using distance / velocity ? Firstly , acceleration due to gravity can vary depending upon location ; hence making speeds differ even if object falls straight downwards. Secondly when objects move horizontally their horizontal velocities may not necessarily stay constant because other factors like wind or air resistance come into play too such affecting overall flight path etc.. Thirdly assuming initial conditions before dropping height won\u2019t change throughout entire experiment means ignoring any changes happening along way while falling say changing direction angle caused friction resulting drag forces acting opposite motion causing reduction thus alteration within trajectory itself !

To find out how many minutes Steve practiced the piano once, we need additional details about what exactly happens when it says he played the guitar twice as often. Without specific numbers regarding guitars or clarification whether playing frequency translates into shorter individual sessions or longer but fewer sessions overall, it's impossible to provide accurate guidance toward calculating exact amounts for either instrument without making unfounded assumptions about unprovided data such as duration of sessions for the guitar versus those for the piano, correlation rate amongst other activities, etc., resulting in non-conclusive answers due to lack of contextual support within question statements alone.\"",

WeekTotal= ((HoursPerActivity\u00d7NumberOfActivities) \u00d7 DaysInWeek) PerSession NumberOfWeeks To calculate the amount of time spent on TV and reading in 4 weeks you need to consider the following steps: First, determine the daily time spent on both activities combined.
