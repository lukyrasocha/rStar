First calculate thirty percent because if you multiply twenty by three it would result into sixty which represent thrice amount of videos game held by brian this equals sixy minus fifty results into fifteen Video Games. This means only one fifth represents half dozen or twelve Videogames hence ten plus fourteen amounts nineteen videogames representing twice twenties so add up all these quantities resulting into forty seven Video Game(Videos). Therefore Bobbie hold fourth seventeen Videos . ",

Calculate three times the amount of videos game Brian still possesses which equals to  20*3=60 .Subtracting this figure by 5 would result into 5 less than what we found so it would equal out to  60 \u2013 5 =65 Video Games. From here you can conclude based off information provided stating that since Boboy (has) 5 Fewer Than Three Times As Many Game Saves Relative To What Is Found When Multiplying Twice This Numbers Amount ,and when multiplied twice resulting(when subtracted 5) yields us our solution being sixteen. Hence concluding that bobo has fifteen seven thousand one hundred ninety eight.(In my previous statement I mistakenly assumed the correct initial data contained somewhere implicating twenty thirty four.)So finally calculating fifty plus forty minus eleven equaled sixtyfour if using standard math calculation methodology.

F here represents all miscellaneous factors such as loss or gains outside typical circumstances--which doesn't impact the numbers involved during calculation thus cancels itself when plugged into calculations like these involving quantities/values instead of qualitative assessments   , so it becomes Bf = 20*3 = 60 Here, since both amounts involve counting items without further adjustment besides normalization, let s add them together rather than subtract any arbitrary value ; i.e.,    CumulativeCountOfGames = InitialTotal + AdditionalGameFromFriend = TotalInitialBoyAmtWhileDiminishing+TotAddGfs       Or expressed using variables only :      BCGB=(Bi*(Fa))+(Fi)Here Bi refers to Billy's original starting group size while Fa denotes what factor alters said quantity & finally Gi stands for additional groups found elsewhere not related directly tied back nor modified by anything previously stated within document regarding specific changes being applied exclusively to Bi...
