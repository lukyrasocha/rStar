We need therefore; Total amount earned before expenses=(Total classes attended within any seven calendar periods)(Number Of Students Per Session)(Price/student)=$(25+X)*(StudentsPerSession)*(Unit Price)$=$((25)+(numberOfClassesTakenOnDayEight))*C*p$,where C denotes Number of Classes Taken During Weekend Day And p denotesthe price charged towards individual participants .
