Add all charges together before adding any extra fees except the one calculated above so far,$20+$4+TIP(where TIP here=amount overage including tax but not counting service)+TAX_FEE , hence having your formula look like:$20+\\frac{TP}{r}+TF=.

        " 2 dollar for two cookies. Adding it all together comes up as being equal to  15+3+2=20 dollars. This was just the food item costs before any other charges were applied .She also wanted to pay additional charge , which included tips amounting to      5 dollars.

To calculate this I am first finding what would be                    20 % service_total calculated using formula         20/100*service_cost            Calculated Service Fee equals            4 $.

Adding these charges together means its equal ($18$(cookie)+$3 $(chips)$+$.6$)=$(21.6)$. Finally adding tips to this amount comes our result : ((.$21.6$) +(.5))=${22.1}$.So finally we can say that rory s going pay **$22.1** as total bill including everything..
