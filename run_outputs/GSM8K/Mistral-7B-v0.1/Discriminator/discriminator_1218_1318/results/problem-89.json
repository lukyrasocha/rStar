        " table has 4 legs. Therefore calculate the overall amount of stakes needed per whole table using these numbers; multiply (4 x 4) which equates to getting 16. Since you know this figure represents all four tables combined it can further simplified as identifying one individual piece out of those totals simply divide (i.e., 16/4), resulting in needing just 4 stake assemblies or 8 stake components altogether because each assembly consists 2 stakes therefore multiplying again yields (8x2=16). Finally determine if any additional fasteners beyond what was collected initially exist i.e.(total_stakes \u2013 acquired_fasteners); so subtract obtained value(16) minus gathered quantity(40) providing us a resultant negative difference(-24).
