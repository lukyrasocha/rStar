Next, identify how many apples Walter gifted to his sister; here it was mentioned as 'the remainder'. To find out what percent corresponds to these remaining apples calculate 36/(total initially owned), thus resulting into roughly 0.6 or 60%. Multiply that value again using percentage factor i.e., multiply by .6 , yielding him gifting about 36*(0.6)=about twenty four. Lastly subtract eighteen(twentyfour-(number who loved))from thirty six(remaining). Therefore ending up having around twelve unsold ones left over. As per instructions tell us that every apple costs three USD hence our multiplication would involve both quantities leading to getting $(thirty*three). Hence taking all steps together yields sum being equal to one hundred eighty Dollars ($$=six times seventy ). ",
