Next identify the number of yellow candies based off what was stated about them being less than the number of red ones i.e., halved the quantity of red. Half of Red= Yellow so divide the original count of red candies(54) by 2 getting you exactly thirty six yellows.

From Condition ii & iii -> Yellow Candies(`Y`)=`HalfOfRedCandies()`i.e,       `(HalfOf(Double of Total No of Orange)))`, similarly Blue=& M& E aren't mentioned so lets consider their values irrelevant till now thus leaving calculation mostly dependent upon above variables.(we know all other quantities except those relatable to required value('Green'))     Therefore finally,(orange)`N = ((2)(total numbers))`-> N/SetToNumber((toInfinity); //Because set function takes positive integer inputs ;//It returns output accordingly since input doesn't matter                      Hence Green Count (`G``n=g;` becomes green count based on earlier equation )).
