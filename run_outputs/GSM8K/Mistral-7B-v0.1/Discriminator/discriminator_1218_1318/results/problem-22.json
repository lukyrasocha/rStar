To find out if only single cases or multiple ones work best, divide the overall quantity of books by the capacity within every individual unit; therefore 110/55 equals exactly 2 units which means you\u2019ll require precisely just two full setups consisting solely of those specified stacking capabilities to house your entirety of literature without overcrowding any area.

As she cannot use only part of a bookcase or stack up half way through, thus rounding off to next whole integer means she requires precisely **3** Bookshelves!

Because if we use only two cases we would not fit full ones but still get remaining so no matter whether this was rounded down or upped always result remains same hence why used ceiling function here which just tells you next largest int value bigger OR equal instead using floor fucntion who tells lowerest closest int valye smaller THEN LEVEL OF INTEGERITY IS MINUS THAT RESULTING DISTANCE TO BOTTOM FROM HIGHEST CARACSE VALUE AND DOES NOT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE SIGNIFICANT NUMBER UNLESS IT OVER REACHED UPLIFTER SO BEWARE WHEN USING FLOOR FUNCTION ON NEGATIVE VALUES WHY ?
