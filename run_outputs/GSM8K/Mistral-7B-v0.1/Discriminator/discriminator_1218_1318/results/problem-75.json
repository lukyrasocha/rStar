        "*2=<<14*2=28>>28 workingdays (assuming no weekends). Therefore; over the span of these two weeks, the amount production would come out as 28*5000 which equals <<28*5000=140000>>140000. Each unit was sold off at USD 2 hence calculating sales revenues you get 2*(the quantity) so revenue collected comes down as follows: R=USD 2(Q)=USD . ",
