To calculate average means taking numerator divided equally among denominators hence divide both sides such division : Firstly take any single item value within brackets say N=n+x(y ? Z) Here n stands sole responsibility while others represent other factors affecting outcome therefore add those values altogether called X except themselves likewise Y adds nothing until z becomes zero making sure no extra terms remain thus resulting negative infinity upon substitution due calculation error.. Next remove parentheses leaving me C/D but keep ratios equivalent throughout remainder calculations involving fractions etc.: Simplifying further removes fraction sign thereby yielding positive results equalizing term weights proportionately based off weight adjustment mechanisms implemented across industries worldwide known widely amongst statisticians alike helping simplify future predictions regarding stock markets forecasts & economic indicators trend lines!

To find Sally\u2019s average (mean) marks we divide this value by the quantity n=9 since these observations represent only 9 unique values or \u2018observations.\u2019 Therefore, 630/9 yields  70 as our result. Since mathematical results generally require units it would be appropriate here to list \u201caverage\u201d underneath the numerator so our solution reads . When not dealing explicitly with quantities such as numbers which could possess physical dimensions associated like time intervals etc., I tend to use words rather than symbolic representation simply due to ease of interpretation; hence when asked specifically if 'What was Samantha\u2018s test grade?' without any further contextual prompting one concludes based solely upon available information\u2014which implies no explicit requirement beyond mere identification followed accordingly thus why provide numerical figure alone suffices within scope set forth above otherwise ambiguous outcome prevails unnecessarily thereby confusing both inquirer & responder alike vis\u2013\u00e0vis implied nuances potentially inferred misconceived expectancy possibly arising perusal over similarly themed yet distinct matter domain distinctions subsequently undermining efforts seeking specific clarity desired ultimately causing detriment hindering full comprehension intended purpose sought achieve satisfactorily achieved goal reached hopefully facilitating understanding benefiting readers knowledgeably informed better educated persons empower individuals enabling decision making processes grounded well reasoned rationale leading thoughtful discourse fostering productive relationships building bridges spanning differences engender empathy encouraging tolerance accept diversity embracing global citizenry becoming responsible stewards safeguarding tomorrows legacy ensuring sustainable prosperity secures humanities survival advancing shared progress universal growth collectively uplifting society cherishing commonwealth humane world harmonizing peace promoting justice reconciling disputes mitigate conflicts resolution bringing amity cooperation construct positive change realizing dream goals setting benchmark standards exceeding best practices striving excellence driving innovation propelling development spearhead industry revolution transformative paradigms shift norms redefine boundaries challenging status quo shatter glass ceilings breaking barriers overcome obstacles surmount adversity securing achievement triumph glory celebrating victories sharing joy together working side by side shoulder unto shoulder united vision unitary spirit teamwork collaboration synergize ideas exchange experiences inspire others motivational speech pep talk boost mor",
