        " Each one was divided into eight equal parts or slices according to the question statement above. Multiply these values together since we need to know all possible ways (combinations) to distribute/share those seven big \u201cboxes\u201d(pizzas). That\u2019s why you multiply when dealing with permutations such as sharing items among different people while considering every single box separately. Therefore let us calculate it mathematically which would look like this; Total Number Of Slices= No of Pizzas*No of Ways You Can Divide It Into Equal Components. Hence applying our calculations we get ;Total no .of Slices=Number_Of_Pizzas \u00d7no_ways=. This equals : Total No~Of ~slices=(7)*[(total slices per pizza)/number of individuals]= 7\u00d7[8/4] , here comes another simple calculation part just divide everything within bracket because its only division operation available before multiplying numbers outside brackets first due mathematics rules governing BIDMAS etc..

Since it includes six persons sharing those portions including themselves \u2014 as identified earlier in this riddle; therefore divide our previous result evenly amongst these members \u2013 sixty-four minutes passed / 6 individuals yield fifteen seconds apiece [(56)/(6)] approximately equalling around eleven point thirty three [round down] twelve rounded off due to impossibility of decimal measures when dealing with food consumption hence conclude their shares would likely land within one range -- ten whole increments but round up because no person wants less than others!

First compute seven times eight which equals fifty six or written mathematically as . Next divide through even numbers since division requires fewer items than addition requiring both halves work together yet no excesses remain undivided throughout due having less elements within compared larger quantities like adding greater whole parts without subtractive differences needed herein; so take half again making sixty three twenty nine roundings up minus nineteen plus fortyeight remaining equal shares available amongst us all while keeping everyone happy despite seemingly insufficient portions allocated individually first thus eliminating unnecessary hassles associated whenever possible minimizing confusion over who gets what part based upon quantity rather preference according established protocol(given criteria).

        " That means there are a total of 7*8=<<7*8=56>>56 slices available. They need to divide this among 4 people (Henry plus three friends).

Therefore the correct choice as asked in question 'how many slices,' isn\u2019t applicable here since it was asking specifically about division amongst individuals but not necessarily resulting in whole numbers due to nature of original problem setup i.e., sharing indivisible items.
