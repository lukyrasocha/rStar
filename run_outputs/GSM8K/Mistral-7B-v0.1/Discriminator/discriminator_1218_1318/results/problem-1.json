Given these details but absent specific prices; what would make up half the amount spent if only book sales contribute positively toward calculating this midway expense figure (in USD), ignoring all other items?) To identify which item contributes most substantially towards spending we consider individual pricing based solely upon purchase count: Without concrete numbers, let\u2019s hypothetically assign variable 'b' for books, 'n' for pens, \u2018m\u2019 for notebooks, and k for keychains.

This simplifies into '$final amount/(1-(the decrease percentage divided by hundred))', thus becoming '($final payment)*[(Decreased Rate Percentage /Percent Change)+1]=DiscountRatePurchasePrice' this simplified form calculates deals better than just finding out actual numbers directly when offered multiple percentages options available across various objects being purchased altogether. As stated above we know initially if calculated without any reductions would come up-$100 according previous equation which results correctly because no decreases took place hence applying rates only affect calculations afterwards resulting changes happening separately keeping initial values intact prior knowing exact reduced sums obtained later leading totalling everything down eventually reaching same ending result anyway ensuring accurate outputs regardless timing while completing tasks allowing clients easier understanding regarding overall expenses necessary towards accomplishment desired rather confusing situations arising solely based upon incomplete information provided early stages sometimes proving hard making everyone struggle trying figuring correct combinations needed effectively handling specific cases accordingly solving problems presented efficiently utilizing every minute counting toward success!
