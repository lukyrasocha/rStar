Since nothing else can actually decrease further , let\u2019s calculate the loss based upon 30%, which equals approximately  90% remaining(original) quantity minus 30/100*$=($9,-69)$;which results into only about  27% ($=$valueofboat,$)=[$27/-*$] leaving us roughly $(-$6.3$),with negative denominator denoting absolute amount rather positive whole percentage portion.(Remember :Depositing something simply subtracting part away.)Second year follows similar procedure since again lesser effect could result when applying previous ratio onto existing diminished proportion itself.

Finally, subtract the last percentile decrease representing about $720 off what was calculated earlier($3600*(.2)*(depreciation rate)).

Doing similarly for Year 3 \u2013 calculating the reduction because only 20%, not 30% like last time was deducted so its equal as : Total Depreciation rate=   [(year one)(x percentage)|(Year Two )|+(YEAR THREE)*percentage] / 3 = [(.3)+ (.3)+(.2)]/3=.
