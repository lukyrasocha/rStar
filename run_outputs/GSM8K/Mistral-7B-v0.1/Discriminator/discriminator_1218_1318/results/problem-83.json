        " early snack leaves him with (9-1)=8 oatmeal cookies, (4-1)=3 chocolate cookie, and (5-1)=4 sugar cookies; i.e., we reduce overall count as well resulting into 12 cookies remaining so far(8+3+4). Remove another oatmeal cookie leaving us with only 7 oatmeal cookies while keeping all other counts intact. This results further reduction leading to subtotal being ((7)+(3)+(4))=14 . Following this order, remove additional sweetness away taking out 2 Sugar Cookies reducing their share to just (4-2) =====> making new adjustments bringing overall sum down lower than before => (7 oatmell+(3)-((choco)(l)))=(4-2)cookies--->overall totals yielding up ->new_cookie_count ===  7oakmel+(chocoliens)=>(4-)sugars===9..
