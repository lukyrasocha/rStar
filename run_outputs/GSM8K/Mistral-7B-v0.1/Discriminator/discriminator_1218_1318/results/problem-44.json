You still need X mins before finish all Y(words) regardless increased flow since no delay compensation happens simultaneously during transfer... Another point missed out : Did not clarify Pages vs Sentences when mentioned Page Limits exist . Since both sentences & paragraph formation depends heavily upon writer fluency alongside individual writing preference too.....Also overlooking possible repetition issue while increasing vocabulary range thus potentially doubling effort required just merely converting simple sentence structure.(unless employing efficient communication methods like bullet points or tables etc.) To accurately determine exact minutes taken solely based off word count without factors such us content cohesion , context relevance / accuracy balance amidst rapid delivery becomes impossible\u2026 This clarification could help better understand what lies behind these assumptions presented here ! Moreover question needs specific reference regarding overall aim including completeness versus quantity orientations because otherwise vague language makes finding optimal strategy highly subjective thereby creating confusion among users seeking precise guidance!!

Additionally breaking down further parts individually calculating average rates achieved along various sections adjustment made respective delays allowable until reaching termination criteria ensures fair assessments whilst preserving realistic expectations considering human limits yet also achievable target margins provided proper preparatory efforts undertaken earlier stages involved practicing techniques focused around building stamina skills gradually progressively enhancing potential outputs eventually meeting desired benchmarks successfully completed tasks \u2026",

Each page contains 450 words so three hundred seventy-five (375) written words can be read every minute which equals six hours twenty-two minutes forty seconds according to one common rule stating reading takes about ten seconds longer per word over normal reading speeds. Hence, thirty thousand seven hundred fifty (37500) words divided by sixty Hours twelve Minutes Forty Seconds (6HMFPS), or converted into decimal equivalent nineteen point four zero eight five (19.4085) second intervals per write yields approximately eleven point negative two half dozen sevens (-2h2d7). Rounding this down makes fifteen point five minus seven equal eight full reads as possible within these time frames leaving us with extra eighteen points plus another hour worth being completed during extended sessions when spoken aloud without significant interruptions.
