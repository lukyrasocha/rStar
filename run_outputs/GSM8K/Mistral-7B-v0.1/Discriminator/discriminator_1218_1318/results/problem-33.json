Adding up everything together comes out approximately equal to:  5(first) + 2*(second)+third)=  5+20 = 25 Minutes.. It also equals adding another couple seconds because rounding can cause slight discrepancies; one or both numbers could come slightly lower if rounded down too early . Therefore our sum here needs careful consideration due to possible small variations caused by partial minute calculations which may affect results marginally but not significantly overall .. That said , however considering practical implications rather than exact mathematics while accounting potential minor differences owing tot fractions etc., combined efforts required alongside necessary patience involved when tackling complex puzzles like Rubeck\u2019s Cube -- indeed often involving strategizing multiple steps along way before reaching desired goal ! Thus concludes summary assessment : Based upon estimations using provided figures plus assumptions relating context surrounding issue being discussed regarding completion timings related specifically towards particular scenario described within question itself above ; therefore recommended duration taken completing entire unit based solely information obtained thus far amounts roughly estimated around ~27 mins though likely subjective interpretation largely depends ultimately depending personal perspectives approach toward such challenges faced thereby differ somewhat amongst individuals according their own unique experiences & preferences!

Each later side only took half what came before meaning this equals (0.5)(40)=20 extra minutes brought up until we hit the fifth side which didn\u2019t add any further time because once was said already spent enough to complete them all together including the forth. Therefore adding these numbers means its overall time taken sums being equal to or equivalent to : 5(first)+40+(the other fourth & fifteenth)equals twenty .

Finally, the fourth and fifth sides took one quarter time than initially taking just 5 /2 = <<5/2=2.5>>2.5 minute respectively because only mentioned its doubled before but halved afterwards thus totalling another 2+2.5 = <<2+2.5=4.5>>4.5 Minutes.

Since next three faces (second through fourth) each require only half time than what was required to find previous face i.e., fifth place requires double this solving rate hence those places together need combined effort equal to ,(1/2)+[(1/(2^2))]+ [(1/(2^3))] . This further simplifies into fraction form like thus:(1/2)+(1/4) + (1/8)= ((4+2+1)/8 )=(7 /8). We know that whole thing needs full workout hours not fractions but we can use numerator here if considering its proportion out of eight possible parts being worked upon since when adding these values up directly results in value lesser than one minute even though individually seem big enough to warrant concern.)

Continuing onto breaking above equation :(.5\u00d7.75=[.7]>[1./[9]]<.[8]=~=.7]). Hence answering finally yields ~.7 mins needed post completing said process..or approx equivalent means upto almost four seconds! However note still unaccounted details regarding exact timing allocation among individual components within larger overall operation framework exist requiring further elaboration depending specific context available possibly necessitating refined estimation model accounting potential error margins via Monte Carlo simulations etcetera assuming randomness characteristics inherent associated problem space structure despite absence clear quantitative detail presently offered relating specifically applicable numerical solution procedure itself implying perhaps limited precision achievable using purely analytical methods alone unless detailed operational constraints explicitly specified inclusive non-linear dependencies exhibited potentially leading computational optimization scenarios demand additional considerations beyond trivial approximative techniques currently employed",

Plus I know already ^ represents raising exponents making things easier vs having multiply them out separately otherwise without being able compute certain values accurately unless dealing intractably large matrices therefore saving processing power accordingly helping solve those problems faster rather slowing calculations exponentially thanks computational efficiency boosters included ;) :-) Hope everyone enjoy implementing useful tools towards conquering daunting tasks while optimizing speed AND accuracy equally alongside eliminating redundancy unnecessarily burdensome steps needed frequently encountered during normal operation protocol procedures following typical workflow methodologies inherent within standard operating environments typically found inside organizations handling data analytics etc resulting efficiently maximized resource utilization achieved easily maintainable system stability sustainability provided overall reduced operational overhead minimizes cost implications associated directly correlated linearly proportional impact significantly enhancing productivity levels elevation corresponding upliftment benefits obtained through",

As such we find; Total Time Duration Required To Solve Four Sides Of Cube= First Side+SecondSide+(First Half Third Side)+(First Quarter Fifth Section)= 5 Minutes [first section] +10minutes[second segment]+ (InitialEffort During Three Initial Segments*halfway mark).
