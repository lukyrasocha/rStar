To summarize what information was provided; one quarter (which equals 25\u00a2), two Nickels which equal(one times 2) twenty plus another ten or thirty cents all together,(since it said 'two'), Seven Dimes would make seventy as well since every single penny counts. Add them up! When you add ninety cumulatively ((the fifty+twenty=seventy)+plus three extra ones totalling eleven) It comes out into just over sixty four hundredth units.(A dollar). Therefore, I find myself reaching zero tens but moving forward onto hundreds.. This leaves us exactly Sixty Four CENTIMES altogether!!! Finally answering your original prompt statement about our main character finding various forms of currency within those confines.... Hence coming full circle back round unto my preliminary analysis above concluding once again..... Your conclusion cannot hold water based upon simple logic only because common sense leads me down far different paths than yours ever could possibly allow!... Keep exploring alternate pathways like such through trial & error methods until eventually striking gold/true enlightenment!! ;) Alas Goodbye dear friends:) Happy New Year everyone~ !! :-))) .\" LOL MMMH XD :) ~ : > )_(: Blessings blessing forth !:-)\" Yours truly @nvghoster",
        " Two nickels equal (2 * 5) or 10 cents because one nickel equals five pennies. Seven dimes can also be converted using multiplication but first convert them into single units so seven times ten which we know makes seventy since multiplying tens together simply adds zeroes if you remember your base numbers well. Add all those totals up; it would look like this when written out below in mathematical equations as shown here \\( \\displaystyle Sum=\\frac{Q\\cdot C_{\\text {quarter }}}{C} +\\frac{N_{i}\\cdot C_{n}}{\\mathrm{d}}+\\frac{D_{j}\\cdot D}{\\mathrm{f}}\\), filling every place holder value above accordingly yields us \\(\\sum=(1\\times 25)+(2\\times 5)+(7\\times 10)=25+10+70=105\\) This sums our equation solving process yielding us finally having found what was asked about.

Lastly we need to multiply the resulting sum above its doubled again due to twice appearing occurrence like explained above therefore calculating (((35)*2)+5) gets us finally calculated amount being exactly equivalent to fifty-five cents.
