Here you need subtraction which means : starting point \u2013 what was taken away=what remains. That way my steps come out like following; Start Point\u2212What WAS Taken Off Equals What REMAINS !!! But here your asking about 'howmanychocoCookies', so startpoint-(rainbows+oats)=cookieleft\u2026..or let us see another formulation ; Total Cookie Make\u2013Total Not Choco=(Choco). And when solving problems always read very carefully before trying to solve \u2026and make sure all terms needed match yours ..:) My guesses could vary since sometimes different methods may apply depending upon problem stated or other factors but best advice possible would be check closely & verify everything first !! This sorta makes sense ?? Hopefully next time someone doesn\u2019t mess up/forget details required thus confusing others such yourself might experience issues too until corrected!

It says these numbers add up (or equal) something or it doesn\u2019t matter what their value actually was\u2014in this case we can ignore those cookie types since all three counts together makeup only one amount as indicated; which means any other type of cookie equals whatever summed above both others mentioned plus another unknown portion denoted hereafter!Simplified version would look like such:`x+y=z`(Rainbows)+(`rainboos`)+(oats)=total (`alltypes`).So using algebra `x+(2595)+3075=z`.Solving yields \u201cchoco\u201d.Now substitute our variables back into equation formed earlierwhere \"`=`\"equals addition/summation`:`[((2595)*)`]-+[(\u201c\u201d)]->-(``))---+[((\"\")).*(-)]]=TotalNumberOfChoc_CookiesSince no further details regarding quantities exist within text itself&nbsp;&nbsp;`we cannot solve specifically without being informed additional information--as currently stated.\u201d\u2009\r",
        " The problem says they also have 3075 oatmeal cookies. To find out the amount cooked specifically as 'chocolate chip', subtract all mentioned cookie counts (rainbow and oatmeal) from the grand total count.
