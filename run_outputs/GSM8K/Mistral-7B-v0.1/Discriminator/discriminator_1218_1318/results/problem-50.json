Substituting values into the equation leads us towards solving it. We know 'total blocks', which equals thirty-two but when considering all factors combined those only form part of this whole amount i.e., specifically eighteen(`blue+yellow`).

        " 2 (blue_blocks*=4; yellow_blocks==blue_blocks*2). Subtracting both types of colored block counts from the total will yield the count of red blocks. Here\u2019s this calculation presented in Python code form:`red_blocks == total_blocks - ((blue_blocks+yellow_blocks)); print(f\"Number of Red Blocks: {int(round(red_blocks))}\")` When we insert these numbers into our formula above, it reads `red_blocks == int(total_blocks) - ((number_of_blue_blocks)+((number_of_blue_blocks)*2);`. Using this equation means first find double the amount of blue blocks (`4*2` yields sixteen), subtract them along with four original blue blocks(`32-(16+4)` equals twenty items remaining), hence resulting twenty being twelve pairs or six times ten which rounded down would still render us sixty minus fifty eight thusyielding just two unpaired individual units making up eleven leftover totals i.e., single instance plus paired twos summing nineteen one less than thirty leaving only eighteen when considering another pair removing thee additional sets thereby arrives back again unto fifteen while accounting yet further seven set decrements equilibrate balance precisely achieving precise quintuple factorial division distributing numerically even splinters generating three duo unit clusters rendering triple combined instances upon reapplication reducing singular quantity accordingly producing merely solitary aggregate value ultimately manifesting exact resultant residual integer quantifying zero.` And so forth...
