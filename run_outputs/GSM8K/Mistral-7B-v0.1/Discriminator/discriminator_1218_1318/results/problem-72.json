Add this value to initial amount making sixty three plus those in other smaller ones summing up to seventy eight overall numbers. Hence the solution becomes; Total seed count comprises seven hundred and eight seeds exclusively focusing solely upon these varieties referred to within your question prompt.(seventy-eight). To recapitulate our reasoning steps concisely: First establish quantity per species. Recognize percentage alterations based off baseline figure referenced earlier. Lastly merge individual totals collectively arriving towards comprehensive resolution whilst retaining focus only relevant subjects described initially herein ensuring accurate computation ultimately leading us directly yield 'Seven Hundred And Eight'. We can see both instances contain logical flaws or errors when trying to find a cohesive conclusion using common sense knowledge about mathematics operations such as adding versus multiplying multiples.

To find out all possible combination(amount) consider its sum too but only once considering repeated values like multiples having same factors thus avoid double counting when calculating such quantities so you multiply their unique combinations together therefore doing product instead add hence use multiplication formula rather addition because order doesn\u2019t matter whereas position taken while multiplying also matters according arithmetic principles called commutative law ; ((n^r)/((r!(log n)^p)), log r).
