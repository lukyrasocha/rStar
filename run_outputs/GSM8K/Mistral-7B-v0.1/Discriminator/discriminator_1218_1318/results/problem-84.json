Calculate these amounts separately before adding together since it involves selling different quantities at different prices. Half of Matthew\u2019s collection means 12 / 2 = 6 soldiers. At this rate, if sold all sixteen dollar worth of collectors items, he could receive 6*$5=$<<6*5=30>>30 dollars from those sales alone. Because one part was calculated as being valued less than another group ($7/$5), we need only add its value; thus, while seven toylars can make up about four percentages above what was received when purchasing fifteen dollars or fewer units, seventeen outlaying warriors remain untouchable due their pricing which exceeds most consumers preferences based upon limited resources like income availability. Thus any extra gains realized via transactions regarding expensive goods rarely translate into overall profit within consumer markets such as America currently dealing directly through major retail stores located across various city boundaries nationwide including Chicago(IL).

Thus divide these quantities among groups according value pairs provided earlier ($5/unit versus $7/units).
