Combine earnings from both sales, so $40 (cupcakes) + $40 (cookies), equals $80 earned overall. Next calculate what it cost Franne to buy them plastic containers if one costs four dollars ,and franne needs seven sets . This comes out as $ 4x7= $28 spent purchasing these containers. Subtracting this expense from Frank\u2019s revenue would leave us : $. To find exactly how much Frank made we need to know either price or quantity info about cake pans themselves... As no information was provided I am unableto determine their exact value but i suspect you might want me round off figures like$9....Thus all possible correct answers among choices presented here range betweenthanormalcylic amounts ($eight ) up till possiblyhighest allowable sum $(ten)..

        " x 40 = $40 from selling cookies. Add up what she earned from both sales: $40 (from cupcakes) + $40 (from cookies) equals $80 overall earnings. Subtract expenses ($4/tray times 5 trays), which equates to $20 spent entirely on purchasing these baking tools. Finally subtract Francis\u2019 spending from all income: $80 \u2013 $20 leaves you with net profit or leftover balance \u2014 this can also signify surplus funds available. Hence we obtain Fran's remaining balance as $60 when rounded off without decimal fractions due considerations about partial dollar amounts being less applicable here). Consequently, it follows logically that since no extra costs such as food ingredients etc., seem mentioned initially nor any percentage based sharing / charitable contribution suggested within contextual parameters established so far; therefore our deduction results directly corresponds solely toward pure financial gain rather than considering aspects beyond immediate fiscal exchange points made evident through narrative provided..

        " find out how much Frances earned overall. $40 (from cupcakes) + $40 (from cookies) equals $80 in sales. To determine the cost spent on purchasing the baking sheets, multiply the price per tray ($4) by the number of trays purchased (five). Four multiplied by five is equal to $20. Subtract this purchase expense from the earnings made during sales operation. Sales operations resulted in Francis making $80, yet when deducted the costs invested into obtaining materials used while running these businesses ($20), it indicates Francs actual revenue stands as follows :$80-$20= $60 Hence, we can conclude that Frances ends up having remaining funds worth sixty dollars following all transactions undertaken throughout this specified timeframe.$ "
