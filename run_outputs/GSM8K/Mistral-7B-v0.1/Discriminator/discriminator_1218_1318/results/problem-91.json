Calculate how much money Mrs. Anderson made using what you know about Alexandra\u2019s earnings; she makes $320 more so add up their amounts like below:  430 (Alexandra) + 320 equals 750 . Next find out how much money Kate earned above Sarah as it was stated before \u2013 \u201cMaryam Raise 400 More\u201d , so if we calculate again we get :  300 (Sarah) plus 400 equals to 700 . Lastly, use addition operations once again and put together our results calculated previously ; i.e., first kim make 750 combined with second Katie bring 700 which totals summed amount equaling to :   750 + 700 making zero dollar cents= $1450 . Hence concluding your task statement answering question henceforth would look something alike mentioned numerically as follows: **The Total Amount Raised Is: $1450**",

Adding up their individual totals yields (430+750) plus (300+700)=$2180 as our grand sum. Thus, together they managed to accumulate overdollars ($2180).
