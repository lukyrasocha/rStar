One way to find out remaining quantity would require multiplying original amount by this specific ratio i.e.-one over four times twenty equals five. Since we know three quarters part was gifted, it means seven pieces equal portions became gifts; since every single unit represents size 'five'. Two units worth remained so multiply them together yields ten as remainder.

Plugging values into this equation yields [(20 * 1) / 4] resulting in four remaining pomelos post gifting them off i.e., Y_pomelos= 20*(1/4), so subtract those kept yielding Z=(total pomelos)-y_pomelos ((20-(20*(1/4)))) equals sixteen (= twenty minus eight); hence indicating Sixteen Pomelo equivalents exchanged hands meaning Twelve (Twenty less Four)=x value denotes twelve represents the count gifted away concluding Thus, the required outcome stands resolved.

Calculate difference between initial count & remaining quantity which equals amount transferred during transaction. We know this because you cannot lose or gain any objects other than through exchanges or transactions thus if we subtract current size from previous it would equate exactly into said transfer as shown below => Remaining Quantity Subtract Initial Size -> Transferred Amount 5 Pomelos ---->---  5 POMELOS This means that when compared against previously acquired amounts, these new numbers tell nothing about gains but everything about losses excepting transfers so since one receives others things equally therefore such action can also go both ways meaning someone could receive items equaling those given off hence resulting no overall loss nor win even out over time assuming every exchange involved equivalent value like demonstrated above. Therefore concluding our explanation simply put; When taking account item counts prior before receiving same item back following trade activity all participants suffer neither monetary benefit due solely having taken part knowing goods never exist outside mutual agreement yet potential exists indeed although far less probable unless specific circumstance arise involving unjust enrichment scenarios etc.; Conclusion derived follows directly logically though perhaps not intuitively obvious without deeper analysis required understanding dynamics interact within commerce itself thereby requiring additional context surrounding situations occurring worldwide impact economies globally alike economic policies implemented locally designed protect consumers interests specifically individuals who hold disproportionately small share market capitalization funds accumulated annually year round yield minimal positive cash flow upon investments made accordingly ensuring balance sustained across industry vertical levels benefiting corporations entities operating independently under own banner umbrella structure typically consisting multiple subsidiaries affiliated company partnership agreements binding contract legally regulating relationship parties engage commercial operations together towards achieving common goals collective objectives maximizing resources efficiently sharing expertise knowledge experience skillsets leveraging strength advantages weaknesses overcome challenges competitive advantage drive successful strategic growth execution ultimately driving prosperous wealth generation society advancement development progress improvement general public welfare social wellbeing holistic approach building healthier communities stronger nation safer families happier citizens enjoying higher standard living quality life enjoyable working environments conducive productivity efficient innovation technological breakthroughs enhances business culture fostering global cooperation collaboration promoting harmony respect peace diplomacy solidifying unity bridging",
