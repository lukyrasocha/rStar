Since three groups exist excluding the last one mentioned (\\(2^n\\)), but only their size matters; not its cardinality itself.) We can also use iteration as follows :\r\\\\[c_0=\\{x\\} \\\\quad c_{i+1} := \\{x\\}\\cup{i}\\{|x|=|c_{i}|},\\]where $|x|$ denotes cardinarlity.\rThis tells us what happened over all streets ; finally having zero children remaining allows removal of the base case value too.\\(\\color{",

Another similar increase follows as we move forward into further streets.

Similarly, again double what was before including all extra ones present; this results in increasing them further twice as much due to getting tripled upon reaching these streets [i.e., ((5*1)+1)*(2))]*(((5*2)+1)), resulting in ((5*2)*(2*11=22 children). Subtracting only the original 5 who quit leaves us with 22 minus 5 or simply 17 remaining behind.
