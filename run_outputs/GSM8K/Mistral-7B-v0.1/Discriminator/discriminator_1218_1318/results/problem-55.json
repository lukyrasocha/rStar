However, since we know Dallas began with only half of what was available, it indicates that no other changes occurred except for these 4 loss occurring during their activity time. Thus if Dallas ended with less than original amount because of losses but not gains or divestment transfers post sharing initially; the discrepancy directly reflects the remaining portion handed over to Darla.

However, assuming you cannot divide odd numbers into halves perfectly while sharing items like this case involves whole objects -- specifically round off downwards -- it means MaZIE provided 2*floor(half) extra\u2014this accounts for initial excess caused due to division error-- resulting in DaLa getting exactly same quantity as original calculation without reduction; hence making her share identical to DallAle at 13 including recompense overrides .
