We calculated total covering requirement as above but since units aren\u2019t match here due packaging unit information being provided therefore first convert meters into yards assuming all inches equivalent to about three quarters miles/mile i.e., distance around outer edge equal sum up sides hence adding this would increase coverage thereby reducing further amount so converting yards metric system meter scale factor comes out same considering both systems approximate thus only consider value difference irrelevant when dealing wiith smaller quantities like mentioned case , let us perform calculations dividing previously obtained result by size of single packet .

We already know Length : Breath :: 20feet:: 15 feets so using above formula but replacing letters I get following equalities => Pl/L = Bd / B or just   Br = Hc since both ratios compare same elements right ?    Let's look closer into my reasoning . When calculating proportions you actually work out their cross products ie multiplying them together ! Thus our equality becomes :- LongestEdgeLongestSide \u00d7 ShortestEdgeShortestSide ================================ Cross product comparison Proportionals can always be rewritten like such! Likewise if want convert percentages % XY% & YX =&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;%XY/(1-% ) OR dividing something via ratio ... well than multiply ..so doing the conversion lets us use simple numbers thus making calculation easyie easier ;)(and less prone to error ...) Our example let' see what was going here..when looking through examples trying different combinations etcetera until finding perfect match ....So suppose next time i am stuck im not sure about setting things proportionallily go though these steps again.....first calculate 'something'-i guess thats why its called relative ^^....then put resultant value over 100*times signifier meaning either fraction equivalent representation eg...or decimal eqalization whichever way feels better :) Hope your project goes smoothly ken ;) good luck mate ..Btw even without converting units still ends u wth exact outcome thanks guys :( anyways hope ur enjoying working ops hacks (: never ending story folks :-)",

To calculate this let\u2019s first determine what would be the amount if it was only around length or height , which equals : [L*H= L*W].  20*(1+1)= 40 Feet;  That implies another pair of opposite lengths require also 40 More than . And Height requires similarly Another Pair Of Opposite Sides Requires Same Much. Adding These Equals -> 40 feets (Length)+40feets(Other SideOfLongDimension ) + 15feet(Width OneSide). Therefore ",
        " the fence (in this case, it doesn\u2019t matter which dimension you use since both result in streaming parallel lines across) times its width/length accordingly. That would mean either multiplying Length*Length or Width*Width depending upon your approach but because only whole amounts can practically exist hence here let us go with 'Perimeter'. Therefore if P= Perimeter(or Total linear distance required), calculate using formula P=2L+2W; so substituting values mentioned above we get as follows:- P=(2*(length))+(2*(width)). Putting respective value results into place :-P=(2x20)+(2x15). Simplification yields:-P=40+30.=Total~Distance Required::70ft.. Hence consider buying approximately ~70 Feet Streamer Roll. Please note assumption made was no repetition overlapping any part once placed horizontally around , i.e., assume entire fence line covered without doubling up on single positional point due possibly to limited amount needed / excessively expensive! Also keep mind while calculating actual time consumption & costs could come down quite bit based manufacturing specifications etc.; But these types generally cost less price per ft comparing higher density alternatives like curtain material too available commercially ..So best bet probably goes towards considering minimum quantities yet ensures maximum reach ;-) Cheers :-) Hope I helped !!

Therefore, if you include double coverage along edges and assuming no overlaps or errors, James may want around ~105feet but always ensure extra material just in case as cutting might leave unusable remnants , typically adding about 10% additional could suffice . Conclusion: Considering possible losses during installation approximately require~ 105+(10 /100 )*105 = ~115.5 hence round off makes its better safe than sorry Approximately -> ",

Therefore we only count them three times instead which makes our calculation become [(15)x(3)+(20)*(2)]=45+40=85 ft^2 area covered plus however high above ground level any desired point needs stringing too...and also remembering sometimes corners may dip slightly downwards requiring additional excess lengths over what exactly flat rectangles calculate out because curved surfaces take away straight line distance equations quite noticeably versus actual measurements taken around tight turns/interior angles etc.--so even though if strictly mathematically speaking using nothing else besides geometry figures alone might yield answers different than actually practically experienced due mostly human error when measuring objects especially irregular shapes compared against simplified Euclidean formulas used frequently within textbooks rather academic books written decades ago..
