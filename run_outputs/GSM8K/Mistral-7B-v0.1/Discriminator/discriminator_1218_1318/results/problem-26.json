Hence, (number of questions answered out of 70) / (total marks/questions), or simply (first_score*test no.+second_passage)/(sum all test numbers). From our previous result above; i.e., if you combine scores across these subjects, say it was equal to 'y'. Therefore ((First Score\u00d7Test No.)+(Required Passing Mark \u00d7 Second Test Number))/(Sum Of All Test Numbers)=\u2018X\u2019 [(60\u00d770)+(70x40)]/(70+40)=[4200+2800]/110=70%. Thus far so good!

Therefore if S denotes success rate per individual exams or subjects such things don\u2019t change across multiple evaluations because every student follows same pattern; hence no effect upon changing scores etc.. Henceforth our equation reads thusly!
