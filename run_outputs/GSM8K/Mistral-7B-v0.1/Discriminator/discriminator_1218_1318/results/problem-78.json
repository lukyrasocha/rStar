Next we look back into what our friend Lisa buys; this makes us take note about Lisa spending (not just payable) which was mentioned earlier but not calculated yet so let\u2019s start calculating those first; Starting off here I notice one thing important before going any further down that path namely remember always double check your calculations once you finish them using arithmetic operations such multiplication or division etc., although my eyes may say otherwise sometimes! Here goes\u2026the calculation reads pretty straightforward really especially since only adding numbers like above seems simple enough most times however mistakes still happen occasionally when dealing specifically w/decimals . Without thinking too hard though obviously everyone knows addition equals zero regardless whether positive negative whatever sign appears upon inspection usually yields same result because math rules apply universally everywhere else also \u2013 no matter if its algebra geometry trigonometry calculus combinatorics optimization probability statistics physics chemistry biology economics politics finance accountancy law medicine pharmacotherapy psychiatry counseling guidance advice assistance support consultation coaching care coordination supervision management teamwork mentoring therapy help information service knowledge theory skills technology innovation ideas implementation development collaboration creativity art expression productivity entrepreneurship career advancement training education learning experience personal growth professionalism leadership motivation inspiration empowerment efficiency effectiveness quality improvement safety security health protection environmental sustainability justice equity fairness compassion humane humanitarian treatment understanding diversity appreciation cultural sensitivity mutual respect civic engagement democratic governance rule based authority responsible citizenship participatory decision making collective action social capital civil society activism reform progress movement transformation change revolution peaceful nonviolence pacifist peacemaking reconciliation dispute resolution negotiations mediation arbitration settlement compromise agreement conciliation concession principle shared values ethical normative standards moral principles legal rights common goods public interest private interests societal benefits individual liberties political economy classroom pedagogy curriculum instructional design assessments teaching methodologies feedback evaluation rubric criteria grading policy transparency integrity trust building partnerships networking community outreach volunteerism philanthropy charitable donations fundraising campaign advertising media relations marketing communication branding promotional strategy digital presence online communities web platforms mobile applications smartphone apps application software internet infrastructure cloud computing data analytics artificial intelligence machine learning",

Putting everything together we can see that altogether these totals up to (100+$5)+($30+$300)$ , simplifying further leads us $(135+330)$.
