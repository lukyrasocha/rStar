        " day. That means he sells 10*12=120 doughnuts daily because one dozen equals twelve items. Each doughnut sold costs him $2 so in total monthly earnings would be (price_per_doughnut)x(quantity/day)*days_in_a_month which translates into price_of_all_donut*(num_dozens_*no_items_in_one_dozen*days_in_june). Substituting those values we get ((Price_each)*Donuts_everyday)*Number_of_Days(). Calculating this using numbers provided, it becomes =>((($2)(120))=(240)$/(number of days present in june)=$240/(end date-$start date)).

Let's first find numbers pairs following the rule provided \u2013 let me breakdown what we need here; since Day doesn't go beyond 31 & Month won't pass past 12(Jan till Dec), one digit would always consist only out of single figures like leading zeros. Therefore effectively limiting us comparing ones places across different types i.e., Days versus Months.(Days >= Monthes due restriction reasons.) Also keeping mindful about never repeating Date combination within its own specific month irrespective whether Jan starts off or Mar ends.

        " day (as it stands; one dozen means twelve). That would mean daily production comes out as costing him  24*1=24$ Daily sales equate to this revenue. Thus, monthly earnings can be calculated through calculating cumulative weekly revenues multiplied by 4 months i.e., ((daily_production)*price)((number_of_days_in_june)/(week))*(4)=revenue This equals [(24)(6)]x[(31/7)(4)]which results into $(144)[(4.4+1.1+0.5)+$(144[4.4]=($633.6)$24=[(4.4+(0.5/4))]i.e.$ (4.4+0.1)=Total Cost or Revenue=(a-(b/(c/d)))where c= Number of items sold during the timeframe , while a represents average amount charged over those same n item periods .

First figure out weekly revenues; since February only has four weeks instead of eight like other months(and assuming non leap years), it contributes just four weeks\u2019 worth of income compared to seven others hence three extra revenue streams or equivalent to ten donut sales/week over thirty-one instances [i.e., twenty regular plus additional] .
