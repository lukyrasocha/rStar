        " We need to find out what it would cost if these bags went sale but still include the discount when determining the unit cost (price) since we want to know how expensive one small pack was during this promotion/discount period or sales event). Therefore subtracting the promotional amounts ($2.00 reduction), which leaves us at $.88/(bill)/per_bag(stick)=$.03p/_of\\_a__pack_.

        " packs inside it (in this case, one) ($18/1). It tells us one single package costs $15 because we subtract what was mentioned as savings during sale which means $3. Thus, divide our new found value by three since these fifty grams can last longer than just being consumed overnight or throughout dinner. Therefore 15 / 3 equals five meaning every gram only needs spending half its original amount when discounting prices therefore;$7.5 divided into units becomes twentyfive(cent), thus making it reasonable without needless exaggeration about pricing individual items outside bulk purchases due largely affected factors such availability within marketplaces localized geographically based preferences influencing decisions concerning specific quantities hence not always suitable nor practical selling goods under certain conditions leading too high demand placing great strain upon stock causing loss especially if sold poorly timed disregarding proper analysis required understanding consumer demands better align quality expectations fulfill potential benefits offered via promotional activities maintain sustainable business practices ensure profit margins remain stable preserve customer relationships fostering loyalty long term prosperity regardless weather economic climate fluctuates affect all segments indirect impact global markets stability relying heavily interconnectedness among industry players worldwide collaborate towards shared objectives drive innovation competition healthy economy competitive environment benefit society collectively ensuring future success continues advancing progress mankind toward brighter tomorrow everybody win nobody loses unless everyone involved fails together resulting devastating consequences potentially irrevocably changing course previously established directional growth momentum may falter jeopardizing plans set aside investments made earlier preparatory steps taken building foundation critical importance vital aspect development process no stone unturned scrutiny essential thorough examination analyze data compile findings interpret results draw conclusions apply knowledge gained develop informed strategy optimize performance achieve desired outcomes accomplish goals make strides forward elevated status achieved greater heights reach milestones crossed finish line victorious celebrate achievements share joy happiness fellowship cherish memories build stronger bonds nurture friendships lifelong commitment dedication integrity honesty trust reliance mutual support partnership collaboration synergy work harder smarter efficient time management prioritization delegation responsibility accountability leadership mentor inspire guide empower team members recognize talent spot opportunities facilitate career advancement enable personal development cultivate well rounded capable individuals contribute valuable resources community enhance overall quality standards uphold ethical principles ad"
