But note here I assumed every single popsicle contains exactly four stripes as no information was provided about their design or patterning count inside them. Without having clear directions if all used up popsicles produce necessary amount of wooden stripings according our initial setup assumptions let us proceed further considering these unknown quantities mentioned underneath heading 'extra details': Total Popstick Requirement : 56 Popsicle Stripe Output Per Batches Of Popsicles: Each batch consists of eight individual snacks containing unidentified amounts of colorful wood splines leading onto what seems like iconic symbols drawn upon ice.

Multiply the price per box times the quantity obtained above ($2*), which results in twelve dollar since one pound costs twenty cents. Thus, building the monument would result in twelve dollars; thus, we can conclude B option as being correct.. To calculate this solution, initially identify three important facts extracted directly from question context: One) Popsicle prices are available through calculation via dividing population sizes amongst populations. Two) Calculate amount spent based on information found before using math equations like division or multiplication respectively...
