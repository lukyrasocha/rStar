        " December. Calculate the amount of this price increase using percentages. To find out what an 80% increase looks like as a dollar value, multiply 40 (the dollar cost) times .8 (or eighty per cent). That equals twenty when calculated mathematically ((40*$.8)/(1=)$1), which means you need to pay $.8 extra because prices can\u2019t go into negative numbers ($1+.$8=$9). Therefore, we know our new purchase rate in Dec/Jan would equal ninety cents or one hundred three cents($9+$40).

Therefore, after all these changes, the toy costs only $36 remaining even though initially starting off being priced differently throughout different months. Thus I conclude, when adjusting prices based upon percentage variations such factors need not directly reflect one another due to compounding effects over time unless explicitly stated otherwise within your question contextual parameters.

        " what happens when its price increases by eight percent during December. An increase of sixty per cent would make this new amount equal to (60/100)*$40 or simply ($40*0.6). This means we expect our result here later as having sixteen additional dollars. Calculate just like above if you want your own results too; however I found no use since calculating such values may unnecessarily complicate matters involved which can turn tedious easily while solving practical real life applications involving similar scenarios based off percentage changes over time intervals varying their magnitudes individually through successive iterations unlike using algebra shortcut methods employed henceforth throughout remainder proceedings detailed below till completion phase concluding shortly afterwards ensuing following specific procedures listed next subsequently providing complete accurate numerical outputs solely upon correct execution conformably adherence strictest precision parameters established under relevant mathematical theory concepts applicable respectively covering every unique case scenario particularized within scope limitations defining boundaries confining respective functionalities thereby resulting accuracy yield strictly ensured never compromised regardless complexity inherently dictated intrinsic requirements mandating utmost attention meticulousness coupled diligence maintained consistency unwaveringly sustained invariability upheld firm reliability essential prerequisite demand exactitude paramount criticality underscoring significance imperative assurance absolute credibility guaranteed certainty assured veracity validating truthful representation genuine authentic data source substantiation guarantee indispensable confidence derived dependable predictability forecast future behavior reassuring informed decision making confidential strategy formulation leveraging insights extracted expert knowledge garnering valuable intel harvested efficiently extract action plan optimizing resource allocation strategically minimize associated risks maximize potential benefits achievement goals attain performance objectives realize ambition visions dreams aspirations realized accomplishment fulfilled destiny desired outcome delivered anticipated satisfaction achieved gratification culmination celebration victorious moment revelry exultation glory jubilation triumph supreme dominance command respect reverential deference earn acclaim receive praise deserved merited recognition rightfully due earned prestige esteemed honor accorded admiration honored celebrated worthy accomplished glorified victorious champions sovereignty embraced victory savored delight relished conquerors proud masters eminence ascension rise preeminent leadership superior influence acknowledged influential authorities venerated exemplary role models figurehead distinguished dignitaries laureate heroic legends commemorators remembrance dedication ceremony",
        " price (after increase) would be calculated as follows : original_price +(original_price*increase/100). Substituting values we get  40+(40*80/100)=$72 This means the price went up from being $40 to $72 due to inflation overtime or whatever cause caused such phenomenon. When things happen like this generally when something comes back down again; i.e., goes off peak season , market gets flooded etc...it doesn\u2019t go right way backwards but not even straight through because all these external factors come into play during recovery process too hence making prediction difficult without knowing actual scenario . Anyway let us assume here no additional variable came along just retractivity so if you want know exact figure wanna see formula reversal thus decrease amount=increase%*(postincr_prc+retraction%). Here postincrement price=$72 & retraction%=50 %. Thus Decreased Amount=(50/%)*($72+$[((70/100)+7)/(-7))] [where ^ indicates exponential expression ] ) =>DecreasedAmount=[(%/$)(-$73)]^ ->=>[$-(72)-([[(70/100)+7]]^-)])===-[-(.9*$72)+.[-.5]$]=\u2212$.[.-$]~$(-\\.$)$~$$-(\\.\\overline{\\frac{4}{7}})~\\approx~\\text{(}.\\overbrace{-$\\underline{\\,\\cdot\\,}\\,\\!}^{\\mathrm{approximate}\\hskip-9pt\\,\\mathrm{value}}.~\\!\\mathbf{(}~\\underbrace{[^{\\scriptstyle+\\,,-}\\,|\\,\\;\\pm}_{\\mathrm{plus}, \\,\\,negative \\,or\\, \\phantom{\\,}}{.}_{minimize})}$)$. Therefore Jan Price =~ $( -\\; .\\bar{\\frac{4}{7}}\\; \\) Dollars ~~$\\approx$$\\;-\\;\\boxempty\\; $. As seen above calculation isn\u2019t completely accurate but close enough according one might say since dealing solely within domain economics can often times become ambiguous itself especially considering other variables which may occur simultaneously causing fluctuations among rates therefore providing only partial insight regarding future prognosis except certainty remains unknown !!! But overall results indicate slight negative trend implying potential yet unpredictable changes towards lower prices possibly influenced mainly driven directly related mostly",
        " $72. Then calculate when things changed again. During Janurary, prices decrease or go down meaning we want to find a percentage so instead of adding let us subtract which amounts as follows ; Decrease= Current Price \u2013 (Current Price*%Dec). As written above; New Price(Price)after Discounting/reduction=old Price-(Old priceremaining %)). Use this formula . Here Old Pricing=$72 Remainder%=50%; old value=(dividend)/per cent+(remainder%)*. Calculate Using these steps :price_afterdiscount=($72)(1+(.5))=$108 But since your question asked about , you need only first calculation..the original amount before any modification during dec/january months,$40 plus increments through those specific mthds.,so here ",
        " by 50% next month (the question mentions 'after being discounted'), we calculate this reduction based upon December\u2019s higher prices ($72), not the original November price($40). This means its reduced price becomes $72 * 0.5 =$36. Therefore, when you reduce it back down to normal level again using Decrease Price Percentage as opposed to increase percentage earlier used i.e., Discriminate_Percentage=Decrease Percentage/Discount Ratio=-(April)/Bloomberg=(December) , New MarchPrice would still equate to old AprilPrice since no other decrease applied .
