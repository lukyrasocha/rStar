Thus our result shows here we see one simple principle governing real world situations such as movement or processes like digestion , respiration among others! As before calculating individual steps carefully pays off when solving seemingly complex issues efficiently without unnecessary recheckings later!! We hope you enjoyed exploring math problems involving practical examples within nature environment ! Happy learning :) Thank You ",

        " minute = 5 minutes hopping. Calculate how long it takes Phineas to swim in water. As his swimming pace is 10 yards per minute, it would require  100 yards / 10 yd/minute = 10 minutes swimming. Add both times together for the entire journey duration: Hopping time (5 mins) plus Swimming time (10 mins) equals Total Time spent travelling which comes out as being equal to 5 minutes+ 10 minutes= 15 Minutes. Therefore, It will take Phineas around '15' minutes to get back home."
