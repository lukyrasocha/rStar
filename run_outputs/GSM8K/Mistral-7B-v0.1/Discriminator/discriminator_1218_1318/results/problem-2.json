        " Since we already know both lengths post cutting (longer being four times larger), adding them together equates back to the initial measure; thus, 10 feet (shorter) plus 4*10= 40 feet(larger). Total combined measurement equals Ian\u2019s overall dimension i.e.,  10+40= 50 which contradicts our premise as it doesn\u2019t add up according to question posing scenario about dividing into parts based off ratio rules! But if asked specifically 'how long is the Longer Piece?' ",
