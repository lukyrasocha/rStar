Therefore, this question contains several logical fallacies within itself such as using symbols incorrectly and referring them illogically. Instead following basic arithmetic rules would clarify our approach; here we assume Rose sold those extra ten eggs equivalent to the revenue obtained without charging anything upfront but through earning upon closing transactions based on normal profits gained from previous sales events similar to business operations like retail stores who generally follow 'no initial purchase fee structure'.
