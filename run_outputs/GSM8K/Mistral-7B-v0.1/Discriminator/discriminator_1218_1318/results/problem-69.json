        " this case (we won\u2019t count cousins). We know one sister is exactly 16 years old; since we don't account individual ages among them other than stating averages or totals here, it can mean both sisters share the age as well \u2013 let's assume so. That means another sister could also be 16 if no information about being different was provided. As per the instruction though only mentioning 'all' makes us take their average age equals single specified instance i.e., every girl shares equal agelessness therefore girls would altogether constitute just around \u2018one big person.'   It follows logically our assumption when considering youngest brother stands out who clearly deviates distinctly younger thus excluding him from contributing towards gender homogeneity hence making sure calculated values remain unaffected even during round off operation but keeping precise overall result intact while providing logical reasoning behind not including said deviation factor directly into core computation . Resultingly combined aggregate female member contribution comes up roughly equivalent unto simply multiplying respective units quantity times common value thereby arriving upon sum namely fourteen eightieth part whole numeral multiplication yield twenty three sixteenth integer figure product implicative summation consequent collective familial cohort senior male component remains indistinct because lack detail however presumption exists such entity bearing midpoint existence yet definitively undetermined resulting unknown datum term inscribed below mentioned interval boundary limit imbuement zero minimum threshold inclusivity exclusivity upper bound culminant absolute singularization quantifier symbol pinnacle finite ceiling magnitude marker unspecified parameter null point ambiguous nominal terminus locator ultimate unit extremality endpoint signpost denotation zenith maxima terminal epilogue conclusion closure closing argument reaffirmance restatement affirmament perpetuatio repitition corroboratory support sanctification testimonium confirmatio validatis certitudinis veritas congruentiae fide firmmatissimorum consensurari coactiones concordanti ad finem deliberativa conclusio apud etiam haec interdiu responderunt plures scriptores quam duo ; allied furthermore auxiliary supplement ancillary appended assistants affiliated additive associations accretion accumulation augmentations amplifications enhancements elevations enlargements encirclement embellishments employment expansion extension facilitation fortification growth heightening influx increase inventory integration instrument increment induction intensification",

        " 16 years old so their combined ages would be 3*16=<<3*16=48>>48. And one brother who is 12 means there exists another older brother who is double this age i.e., 12x2=<<12*2=24>>24. Thus when you add up the three sets (brothers', oldest brother\u2019s & other brother) it becomes; 12+24+(12)+(48), Which equates or calculates out as <<12+24+12+48=96>>96. Therefore if we summed them together equals 96 years altogether. As such our conclusion can state therefore : 'When counted collectively among themselves the group/family consisting solely off male lineage namely elder brother plus younger counterpart amounts totals twenty four ('twentyfour') while those comprised within female members amount accordingly to forty eight (forty_eight). Altogether adding both yields ninety six individuals.'

We sum the other data points too; three Sisters aged 16 yield to us 16*3=48 and so adding everything yields us Total Age = Brothers Together+Older Brother&His Unspecified Younger Counterpart(which equals to Older Brother)+Five Sisters => 24+(1/2)*12+48 Calculation shows outwardly confusing details but it clarifies if you imagine what might reasonably happen when considering unmentioned factors (young children rarely count themselves fully into such calculations). Since calculating requires acknowledging them implicitly anyway within general mathematical reasoning rather than specifically pinpointing single individuals based upon arbitrary values provided during scenario construction especially towards non-identical twins situations , thus following standard algebraic conventions leads directly toward logical conclusiveness via consistent approach irrespective actual numerical specificity associated distinct persons involved..
