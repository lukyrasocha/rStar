Remember also to calculate when you subtract expenses like rent/mortgage or utilities because such items typically remain constant regardless of circumstances or time periods mentioned within the context. Last but not least keep track through subtraction until every dollar amount present reduces further leaving nothing else behind which would equate exactly zero\u2014no matter what combination gets solved alongside variables included initially!
