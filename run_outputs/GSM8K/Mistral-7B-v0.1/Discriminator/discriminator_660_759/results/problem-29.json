Therefore if Manolo previously spent on 5 lollipops plus 4 candies amount was $(5*0.4) +(4*0.8)$, which equals $2+3=5$, this would mean spending twice as much or 'double', for ten items it becomes 'two times fifty'. Hence you calculate `(2*(5*0.4)+(4*0.8))`. This simplifies down into `($2+$3)` equalling `$5`, just like before but for larger quantities being considered!
