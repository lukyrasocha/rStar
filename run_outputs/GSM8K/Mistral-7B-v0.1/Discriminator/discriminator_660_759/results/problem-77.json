Altogether this adds up to 12+14+4=<<12+14+4=30>>30 oz used. Peter initially had 32oz meaning he would therefore still have leftover space which equals 32-30 or <<32-30=2>>2 Ounces remaining. Thus, Peter has 2 ounces of water left over when making these different size cubes according to the instructions mentioned above. Therefore, if we take into account all types of ice cubes including their sizes i.e., Giant(4), Medium(2), Small(0.5). We calculate them as follows : ((Giant)=((Number of giants)*Size)/Total Water available)+((Medium)=((NoOfMediums*size)/TotalWaterAvailable))+(Small=(noofsmallicesize)). It results to ((3*4)/32)+((7*2)/32)+((8*0.5)/32)=((12)+((14))+((4)))/(32)=30/32=. To simplify further lets subtract those obtained numbers until whole no goes away , Here .

Small cubes uses half an ounce which means it requires one-half as often (double), so only needs 2 times its count making them into large quantities hence requiring twice less volume i.e., smaller quantity; therefore using half an ounce x 8 but because every second would mean double amounts while another single remains constant this results having extra requirement like ((8+8) / 2) = <<(8+8)/2=8>>8 additional portions. Altogether accounting these totals becomes 12 ounces + 14 ounces + 8 ounces equals <<12+14+8=34>>34 ounces required altogether!

However assuming reduction , if we replace 3 regular size big blocks worth maximum consumption capacity with reduced counts like : Instead of having large block count become something lesser than its original requirement while maintainin equal quantity level across other categories hence let us recalibrate our calculations accordingly say replacing it this way :   Rather optively choosing smaller amounts might turn out beneficial ; eg reducing them down proportionately considering constraints set forth earlier mentioned namely ensuring even spread amongst diverse category dimensions whilst still keeping balance intact through adjustable tweaks hereonward forward encompassingly leading towards achievement despite evident shortfall identified prematurely previously noted above due largely owning factorial considerations necessitating modification via judiciously implemented strategies thereby yield positive outcome post deduction ultimately leaving sufficient reserve till closing mark preserving same standard integrity initially desired sans any abnormal discrepancy originated subsequently emerging during course taken along said pathway chosen momentarily pursued presently embarking upon journey delineating resolution methodology adherently honoring guidelines provided wholesomely alike throughout endeavored discourse proceedings undertaken sequentially advancing deliberation steps meticulous evaluation performed subsequent determination arrived following logically deductive process culminating conclusively concluding optimum solution unerringly attained utilizing precise computational procedure executed accurately executing requisite computatory sequence consequently arriving triumphantly procured optimal value finally achieved ultimate result confirmed verifying correctness corroborated validation verified authenticity assured accuracy established certainty certified affirmatively guaranteed fully substantiated definitively approved irrefutably agreed thoroughly vetted unequivocally validated beyond question rightfully proven indubitably justifiably evidenced undoubtedly backed by evidence compelling convincing proof providing overwhelming assurance absolutely confirming truthful assertion without doubt confidently",

Hence, according to the data provided, if made into those types of cubes , only '2' Ounces worth would remain unused or could not be frozen further using just normal freezer cooling techniques due to limited capacity etc.. Even though technically speaking any remaining liquid might turn solidify when put under enough pressure & very low temperatures like inside typical household refrigerator compressor units\u2026 This scenario assumes no additional constraints beyond simply distributing quantities across differing sizes whilst maximizing resource efficiency over time span mentioned hereinabove specifically through strategic allocation methods rather than attempting random allocations without regard towards optimization factors involved within same system parameters described thus far...

Altogether Peter used 12 + 14 + 4 = 30 ounces of water making these specialised ice cubes out of one 32 ounce bucket. Hence this means if we subtract what was used i.e., 30 ounces from the original stock which was 32 ounces; it leaves us with only  32 \u2013 30 = 2 ounces remaining. Therefore, Peter still possesses 2 ounces of water unused or yet ready to freeze into new customised ice blocks based on specific dimensions required.
