Hence, around 40% of her threads are blue. Therefore, the conclusion can be stated; About 40 percent of these threads represented color blue. Thus, according to your question 'What percent of lights here colored blue?' It translates into asking about our previous calculation\u2014roughly indicating 40% representation constituted colors falling under the classification Blue group based on earlier analysis.
