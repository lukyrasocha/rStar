Thus putting quotient marks before division symbols results only once again getting back original multiplication symbol used hereafter denoted [Xy] below.\r\rThis shows easily why when performing calculations involving both positive & negative exponents such ones found inside parentheses while solving algebra problems but not necessarily applied outside them generally require working directly upon those whole expressions instead breaking down parts thereby eliminating unnecessary computation steps especially long ones based solely off order rules!
