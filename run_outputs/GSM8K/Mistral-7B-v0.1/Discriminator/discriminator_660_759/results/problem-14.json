To make calculations easier calculate only until reaching halfway mark because once past threshold another set increment occurs again making second time bigger than needed so cut off earlier results ; hence consider calculating upto midpoint but stopping short thereby avoiding unnecessary excessive numbers adding further complications later thus eliminating roundoff errors involved beforehand leading towards significant simplifications while keeping close enough accuracy intact allowing easy comprehension overall process despite initial complexities posed otherwise causing confusion visually etc..
