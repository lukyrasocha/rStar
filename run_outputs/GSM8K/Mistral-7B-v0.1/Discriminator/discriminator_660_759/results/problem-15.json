However, upon returning because there existed double the numbers implying there were actually thrice the original count, making it 4*3 = 12 initial counts per existing condition; thereby increasing necessary toys to three times or(3)*12=(36). Following this increase however not all these newcomers stayed since only 'X'(unknown quantity) remained thus requiring him to purchase lesser amounts finally reducing X*(new addition)=(number of removed) hence removing [(toys calculated previously)-((remaining))]=total difference made.(Calculation here differs based on context interpretation. As described above first explanation implies removal due to absence while second accounts reduction directly post arrival leading to different results.) One common conclusion can infer reduced requirement compared to previous surplus estimation taking average scenario into account suggesting fewer than computed earlier owing partially due potentially absent expected members without detailed sequential event analysis specificity precludes explicit numerical deduction within provided scope unless clarification ensures singular definitive action sequence adherence.).

        " However, before purchasing these toys, James noticed that there were twice as many additional animals (twice means multiplying by 2), meaning there was another set of double this initial increase \u2013 which results in 2*8=16 new dogs. Therefore, without considering any existing stock or returning items later, James actually requires not only enough to match the original count plus all other newly arrived ones but also accounting for both additions: \\( \\text{Original} + \\text{(first batch)} + \\text{(second batch}) \\) equals \\( 4 + 8 + 16 = 28 \\) toys. Upon return to the shop, three puppies escaped; thus decreasing the necessity by three (\\( 28 - 3 )\\) leaving us with 25.

That implies another set (now considering this group also starts from zero). Hence we can calculate firstly having accounting only new arrivals i.e., not doubled count.
