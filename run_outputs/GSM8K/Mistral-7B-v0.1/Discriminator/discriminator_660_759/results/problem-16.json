As per question statement \u201cDylan contributes 2/5\u201d (which means fractional part) out of \u2018total capital value.\u2019 Hence we multiply the whole fund ($1200)*(fraction which represent Dylan\u2019s share), i.e., $1200*(2/5). This results as $(1200*2)/5$=($2400)$/$5$. Which equals into $$480$. Calculate the new balance or subtract this figure ($\\$$480) against the original pool of funds (= $\\$$1200). It yields ((-$$\\$)1200)-(\\$)\\$480)=**\\$720** remains till this point. Identify what proportion receives Francine\u2019s input. Accordingly quoted;\u201cFrancine injects **2/3rd**\u201d.
