Instead calculate what part remains ungroomed when all available time slots fill up while ensuring no job gets double booked/skipped due routine scheduling issues etc..

        " 12 horses so Melissa needs to take care of 8+5+3+12= 28 pets this week. Since every animal counts equally regardless of its size or type (we don\u2019t know if it requires special treatment), we can divide them into equal groups amongst all seven business days; however since we cannot partition one whole entity such as horse among other entities , melissa would consider either keeping out specific job per individual case like maintaining separate records due to different nature/time requirements which might vary across species etc.. Or alternatively doing those who require regular appointments first within normal working hours before proceeding onto less frequent ones throughout remaining scheduled sessions post usual timing window completion .

Thus, if Melissa decides to split up all those job fairly among every working day of the coming week, she would handle roughly fourteen species daily.(Note that you could still come upon fractional values here depending whether or not partial care happens through the week.) However, since it\u2019s practically impossible to complete half animal care without considering human intervention time factorably needed, let us round our calculated value downwards because underestimating isn\u2019t harmful while leaving any being undone causes practical problems but won\u2019t decrease its overall count i.e., counting towards 'not yet attended'.

Let's take rounded down integer division solution instead here : 28/7 roughly equals to about 4 animals per day.

Thus, we could say about around four or so animals per day because  28 divided by 7 equals exactly 4 animal(per day) but practically speaking considering job complexity/time taken may vary based upon individual task requirements and skill sets which might deviate slightly leading to either lesser than 4 instances in few certain scenarios depending totally uprooting circumstances like emergencies etc..

Therefore, 28 divided by 7 equals approximately 4. Hence, Melissa needs to groom around four different types of pets per day if distributing them evenly throughout the week without considering fractions or partial animal assignments. The answer is: Approximately 4 pets per day.

However considering only operational six out of whole seven operating business days often implying Wednesday might rest or non usual hours scenario; thus rounding down would yield better realistic daily distribution resulting into four animal sessions daily plus perhaps extra session(two).
