This means if we assume every vote counts one unit i.e., out of 100 units or simply put every person who voted gets credit of 1, then candidates received the following: Candidate A = 20; since this represents 20%. Since B received 50% more voting power compared to what A secured which translates mathematically to adding half (i.e., divide by 2) of A\u2019s shares to their own making them hold : ((20/100)*100)+(0.5*20)=20+10=30 units. It follows therefore that together these three held all available polling power amounting only to((x)/100)*100=100.
