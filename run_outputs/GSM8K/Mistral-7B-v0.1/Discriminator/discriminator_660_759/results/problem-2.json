Since Gus initially spent 20 dollars altogether, subtracting what was spent leaves him still needing to spend  20 - 13 = 7 dollars. However, since all expenses listed add up only until reaching 13 dollars out of the initial 20 spending budget, it implies no funds remained unaccounted for; thus logically suggesting neither additional nor different purchase categories such as 'apple pie'.

Addition follows order rules without disturbance here because no parenthesis involved just proceed through operation keeping track always start adding starting from extreme right side moving towards LHS remember during intermediate stages never mix results thus ensuring clarity even amidst several calculations especially while performing negative outcomes consider absolute values too sometimes multiplying complex situations yield single line output which saves time instead writing multiple lines repetitive procedure check details whenever uncertain maintain precision throughout process ensure consistency everytime finally present answers neatly formatted show work visually easy comprehension possible quick understanding required frequently checking correctness cross verify alternate methods validate accuracy confirm certainty guarantee error-free precise deliverables essential habit make it mandatory doublecheck periodically eliminate uncertainties optimize performance enhance proficiency gain mastery over concepts become confident experts achieve desired outcome success secured due diligence persistence commitment dedication continuous learning refinement constant improvement excellence expected accomplishments attained hardwork pays dividends rewardable efforts reap benefits realise potential actualize dreams fulfil aspirations reach milestones conquer obstacles overcome challenges navigate difficulties surmount hurdles seize opportunities capitalize growth prospectively evolving capabilities adapt transformative mindset foster innovation discover break",
