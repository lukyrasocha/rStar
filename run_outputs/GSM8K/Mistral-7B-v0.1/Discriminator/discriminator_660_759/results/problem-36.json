Next identify Mary\u2019s (incorrectly written as \u201cMarta\u201d) point collection. According to this information we know it says Bob received three time what Peter receives minus thirty but peter only received fifty because tom gets sixty points so bob thus would receive twice hundred ninety plus thrice(sixty)-thirty yield twenty eighty (+/\u2212 forty due to rounding error). To conclude; summing together their earnings equal to  50+(50x15)/100)+3*(60-(50)) or respectively according to arithmetic calculation::**Adam+Tom**=(50), **Martha**=[round((1.3*50)]]=65 ,and **Mary** [==] [(three)*[sixty-fifty]]=[twenty eighty ]or approximately equals seventy one while taking into account possible errors during calculations using decimals hence coming out not accurate precisely yet close sufficiently..

        " Martha collected. Since it isn\u2019t stated otherwise we assume all students except Tom didn\u2019t change their score compared to what they already scored. Hence martha gets same amount as adam i.e.,  50 . Calculate how many points Tom got without comparing anyone else. We know everyone scores different amounts but not relative values (except betty). However, since everybody needs fewer or equal to tom's numbers, this information won't make any difference to our calculations anyway so let ignore him temporarily . This means Bob still kept initial value which equaled 50 like Alan , before subtracting those extra points accumulated through competition amongst peers . It turns out Albert remains unchanged when others gained additional ones : no increase mentioned yet .. ... As per question 'Andrew gathered thrice Jackie': Andrew obtained threefold Bethesda=thrice Maryann ie,(Ans)=(Beth)x (Mary)+ B/3=(50+b*(.3))*.3+(50/.3),where; b represents james benjamin ; thus one obtains Johnnie Benj.: Joe=.((50**(1-(1*(Jack)*(Tom)))/(Ben)-(Totals / Numbers)).

        " problem tells us \"Betty...collected 30 percent (or multiplied by .3)more\" which means we add this amount to Adam\u2019s so it would calculate as B=A+(A*pct)=(50+(.3*.5))/total students; Here pct stands for percentage but converted into decimal form since its easier like that instead using fractions or % values directly while calculating. But before proceeding further notice something about our current equation structure already shows errors too quickly due carelessness thus indicating poor logic understanding behind operations involving multiples leading towards incorrect results therefore making additional assumptions likely unnecessary yet sometimes unavoidable especially when dealing complex problems without detailed context allowing accurate solution development hence avoiding premature conclusion through flawed reasoning requires extra caution because even small mistakes here could easily snowball affect overall outcome significantly thereby complicating otherwise simple tasks greatly increasing error risk consequently impeding progress ultimately hindering effective learning unnecessarily delaying necessary comprehension mastery reaching desired competency level failing potential achievements altogether ruining career opportunities forever besides being frustrating disappointingly prevent personal growth stifling future aspirations leaving regretful individuals hopelessly trapped unable escape resulting devastating consequences far beyond initial scope considerate reflective action essential maintain balance ensure appropriate steps taken properly sequentially building knowledge effectively solidifying foundation steadily advancing skill set optimizing performance maximized success guaranteed happy fulfillment accomplishments satisfaction happiness joy peace content harmony health wellbeing wholesomeness prosperity fortune destiny bestow blessed luck divine grace guided purpose intentions achieved manifestation reality realization truth lived out dream lives become actual realized goals reached desires fulfilled wishes made come true ambitions accomplished visions brought forth possibilities materialize thoughts ideas concepts tangible actions executed works resultant productivity output created value earned rewards received prizes won accolades celebrated awards honors recognition congratulations celebration gratitude appreciation thanksgiving merriment gladness delight pleasure fun enjoyability entertainment relaxation leisure recreation downtime recuperation rest refresh revitalization renewal vitality vigour energy boost inspiration creativity innovation original thought new idea fresh concept novel perspective different viewpoint alternate angle contrast varied position diverse opinion dissimilar choice alternative route detour departure diversion distraction diversional excitement enthused animated enthusiastic passion energetic charged alive zestful verve zealous spirited vibrancy radiated light",

To find out exactly how many points Brian scored we add these together so  50+15 = <<50+15=65>>65 Points. Identify Betta's relation to Tom concerning their scores. We know Tommy gets three fewer points than Belle but let's identify those before computing it; therefore Bob earned 30 \u2013 (-3)=<<30-(-3)=33>>33 points.

Without such specific information pertaining directly back onto individual scores themselves outside comparison ranges but still within comparative frames due to percentages or direct multipliers/subtractions, making accurate calculations beyond named individuals requires hypothetical inferences which could lead us astray considering problem scope focused entirely on calculation rather than assumed patterns drawn unjustifiably across distinct entities whose raw score relations aren\u2019t explicitly detailed apart from those pairwise contrasts specifically denoted against others among them presented here except noticing incremental adjustments made sequentially amongst persons already identified thus far leading ultimately into concluding remarks tied conclusively around particular figure countings yielding respective point totals derived henceforth accumulatively contributing cumulative sum toward achieving said overall goal postulated ahead necessitating resolution towards target completion benchmark being set firmly upon reaching exact numerical mark fulfillment signified accordingly promptly moving forthrightly unto action execution stage aiming squarely pinpoint precisely identifiable spotlight moment arriving triumphantly rightfully resoundingly ensuring event success verification unequivocally decisive confirmation undeniable acknowledgment justifying achievement validation certitude absolute conviction irrefutable confidence affirmational substantiation guarantee certainty definitive proof warranty security assurance protection preservation safeguarding custody holdinence retention control dominion regulation authority governance rule enforcement legislation compliance adherence consistency steadiness reliability trustworthiness dependability integrity wholesomeness purity innocence blamelessness righteous conduct morality ethics lawfulness justice fairness equity honesty sincerity openness clarity visibility perceiving comprehending understanding realizing grasping recognition discernibility interpretation decipherment deduction elucidation solution derivation determination solving logic reasoning rationales calculating computations reckoning measures metrics estimations approximation approximatables quantifications counts tallies numerosities magnitude size scale dimensional extent breadth width area surface depth thickness density mass weight gravitational force pulling attraction drawing together aggregating consolidation",

Given that the target point value needed for the field trip being reached set as 'minimum_threshold', let's say it needs 400 points; subtracting what students already gathered results in remaining_points = min(remaining_point, minimum_threshold). That means our calculation yields: required_to_reach_target =  400 \u2013 240 = 160.

And since Martha gained three times as many points as Timmy, it suggests martha won 3 * 35 = <<35*3=105>>105 points. Summing up all their scores would mean we add these numbers together; thus, they accumulated a sum of 50(Adam)+65(Betty)+105(Martha)+35(Tom)=<<50+65+105+35=255>>255 units altogether. To reach the goal score i.e., 400 points needed minus this summation results into what still needs scoring before reaching the target mark.
