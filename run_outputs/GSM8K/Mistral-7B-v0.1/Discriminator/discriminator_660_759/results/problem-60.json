        " together because both kinds of boxes constitute types of 'cereals'. Total_boxes_this_week = Number_of_Coca_Crunch_boxes (X) + Number_of_Fruit_Loops_boxes(Y). From our reading, we know X=3 and Y=5 therefore Substituting values into formula: Hence,Total_boxes_this_week equals to  3 + 5 which sums up as 8 boxes This Weekly purchase compared to Lapsed weeks calculation shows fewer numbers when comparing them , so subtract Friday's box count from Sunday\u2019s counter . Therefore More_boxes difference equals Saturday plus Thursday minus Tuesdays+Wednesdays Calculate Saturnine Monday till Wednesday summing up : As per information provided lesser amount spent during previous week lets take it lower side i.e., Previous_Week_spent=$4 Next calculate Current_Mondays Expenditure($)=LatelyBought ($)+PreviousWeekSpent ()/2 or Alternatively simply taking average based upon their expenses next divide Both Days Spends averages over itself hence getting Correct current Money ValueNext derive Difference Between Two Countries Using obtained Valuables using Formula Below : BasketDiff=(ThisWeeksExpensedPrice)-(LastWeeksAvg Price ) Thus calculating above equation yields following conclusion :- ",
