We know that four less than the number of students who need size small shirts need size medium shirts. That means we can subtract four from the number of students who need size small shirts to get the number of students who need size medium shirts. So, we have 18 students who need size medium shirts.

Hence if you add up these values it comes to around (as indicated above):  11+22+18+(~10)+((~10)+6)=roughly equaling either ~77-(or perhaps even simply put, exactly summing up all quantities would yield precisely forty eight plus seven divided equally among ten equals roughly fifty point eight), indicating just close enough approximation being feasible considering fractional figures aren\u2019t possible when determining individual components like clothing items etc..

Finally six larger sized garments needed over these figures make up another group equaling n+6 or here it makes them count amongst our previous groups resulting into a new variable being called 'n'.

Six more students need size extra-large than large, meaning six additional plus those already counted get us another group of 9 (for same reason) making it equal to 9 + 9 = 18 students who need size extra-large. Therefore in all we add up sizes like this:  11(extra-small) + 22(size small)+ 18(medium)-18(large)+ 18=extra-large).
