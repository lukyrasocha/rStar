To find out what quantity both individuals save over twelve months or one year, you multiply these numbers together i.e., (20*12)+(28*12) resulting into [(20+28)*12]= <<(20+28)*12=624>>624 coins saved annually individually by them altogether would equal [2*(624)] = <<2*624=1248 >>1248 coins accumulated during annual intervals within a decade, assuming no losses due to time decay like expiry or damage etc..
