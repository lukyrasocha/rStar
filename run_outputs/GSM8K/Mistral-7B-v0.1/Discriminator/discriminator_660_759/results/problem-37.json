These fifteen non-great-grandmother persons collectively produce another nineteen baby animals because every one produces exactly as many offspring per generation.

Therefore finally taking care before concluding regarding actual figures involving said kinship dynamics involves doing quite complex calculations using simple division processes such dividing totals obtained earlier like above over specific factors involved thereby arriving closer towards determining precise numerical values representing exact relationships found herein based upon historical data available concerning respective clan memberships whilst still ensuring accuracy overall regardless whether particular personages share familial affinity due solely personal choices made independently rather genetically linked ones instead consequently providing clear answers once applied methodologically throughout entire process sequentially until completion achieved successfully satisfying objectives stated explicitly below respectively according predetermined guidelines established initially set forth ahead beginning application phase proceedings commencement followed closely monitoring progress continuously updating status reports continually reporting updates constantly communicating developments encountered during course implementation thoroughly examining results carefully evaluating effectiveness rigorously scrutinizing outcomes critically analyzing findings comprehensively reviewing feedback meticulously assessing information gathered attentively considering details relevant particularly paying close attention exclusively focusing specifically referring strictly adhering absolutely maintaining complete observance totally respectfully observing wholeheartedly following strict procedure precisely carrying out tasks diligently faithfully conducting activities responsibly executing orders accurately accomplishing goals efficiently systematically organizing efforts coordinating actions effectively managing resources wisely optimizing output maximized potential profitably producing yield increased productivity enhancing performance elevating quality assurance promoting standard compliance improving operational efficiency streamlining workflow automation advancing innovation driving creativity inspiring collaboration fostering teamwork empowering individual responsibility boosting morale building camaraderie fortifying communication facilitating participation engagement",

Hence the correct term would actually be either your father or mother\u2019s first cousin once removed\u2013in short terms often referred simply using \u2018grandchild(ren)\u201d without reference numbers but still important enough even though seemingly confusing initially because nobody really knows why anyone calls themselves \u201cfirst cousin twice over!\u201d However knowing basic genealogical terminology quickly reveals itself useful throughout our entire lives regardless whether familial situations remain simple due age differences etc . As such although perhaps slightly challenging early learners could benefit greatly learning relevant distinctions among various kinship labels across both maternal & paternal sides while keeping track along side personal connections especially during times when gatherings occur around significant holidays/celebrations involving multiple branches originating elsewhere entirely outside direct lineage paths thus providing additional opportunities worth exploring further regarding understanding ways people identify relatives differently based historical circumstances contextual factors culture specific habits normatives etiquette customary behaviors patterns shared traits inherited through DNA sequences common genetic markers mutation rates variation inheritance probability deviations phenotypes behavioral variations cognitive skills strengthen potential links established via social networks communal knowledge base collective experiences unique individual stories interpersonal relations romantic love passionate affection emotional bond close companions best friends lifetime colleagues professional acquaintances casual contacts semi strangers random assorted individuals diverse cultures unfamiliar places far away remote islands secluded mountain villages isolated desert oases hidden hamlets secret hideouts deep underground buried burial sites subterranean complexes concealed locations unknown territories distant planets alien worlds extra solar systems galaxies black holes void spaces universe cosmic expanse infinite reaches dimensional portals alternate realities other dimensions multiversal reality parallel universes metaphysics spirituality ethereal existence mysticism magick philosophy ontological foundational principles underlying nature science technologies engineering innovations breakthrough discoveries research advancements new frontiers scientific methods revolution transformative paradigms epistemology axioms belief frameworks perspectives theories conceptual models conjectural hypotheses propositions speculations post",

        " Each of those grandchildren has three babies (great-grandkids), meaning altogether these eight (three parents plus four kids) would make 12 little ones or \u201cgreat-grands.\u201d Since none appear before reaching middle age, this means only one generation shows up as either kid or baby\u2014all eighteen together! Thus no generations past first cousins exist within any specific individual lineage among them; however because it\u2019s stated explicitly every relative descends back directly down via bloodlines without branching branches\u2026 even if someone might belong primarily through marriage over birth etc., therefore everyone could arguably claim kinship toward other relatives based upon whatever criteria established according familial norms recognized generally accepted universally throughout society rather than strictly genetics alone due largely historical social evolution which still applies despite legal developments occurring later into history especially post modern times involving changes regarding personal freedoms affect impact laws relating gender matters particularly pertaining sexual orientation inclusively encompasses LGBTQIA rights movements currently happening around world including North America mostly focused here US Canada UK Australia Ireland New Zealand Chile Argentina Brazil Mexico Guatemala Honduras El Salvador Nicaragua Costa Rica Panama Paraguay Bolivia Peru Ecuador Venezuela Colombia Dominican Republic Puerto Rico Barbados Grenada Jamaica Trinidad Tobago Guyana Suriname French Polynesia Samoa Marshall Islands Kiribati Tuvalu Tokelau Fiji Tonga Papua New Guinea Solomon Islands Vanuatu Niue Cook Islands Palmyra Atoll Wake Island Clipperton Islet Juan de Nova Archipelago Marquesas Keeling Islands Caroline Solae Nunavut Arctic Monarchy Greenland Home Rule Province of Quebec Northern Territories Yukon Labrador West Bank Palestine Israeli Occupied Arab Territories Gaza Strip Egypt Syria Lebanon Jordan Iraq Saudi Arabia Iran Afghanistan Pakistan India Nepal SriLanka Bhutan Bangladesh Maldives Thailand Myanmar Cambodia Laos Viet Nam Timor Santa Lucia Indonesia Singapore Malaysia Philippines Cameroons Angola Equatorial Guinea Gabon Zambia Zimbabwe Mozambique Malawi Nigeria Liberia Central African Repub Dem Rep Congo Sierra Leon Burundi Uganda Rwanda Ethiopia Kenya Somalia Djibouti South Sudan Swaziland Gambia Ghana Ivory",

Therefore only one third of the six (three times nine) great-grandsons would actually qualify as \u201cgreat-grand-babies,\u201d since it was mentioned specifically that each child born later than herself but before any first cousins once removed or beyond could present themselves at such gatherings. Thus this calculation yields just over four 'new arrivals': exactly twelve divided into groups of roughly equal size results either in eleven or ten members per group (since you can\u2019t divide persons evenly); multiplying back twenty individuals provides us approximately forty additional hands available for sharing news photos taken during milestones like baptisms/graduations). But again \u2013 without exact numbers provided regarding ages within generations immediately following hers directly through marriage connections among siblings \u2014 precise figures remain elusive until further details emerge detailing marriages across varying age brackets amongst relatives spanning multiple lines according both familial lineage branches & chronological sequence relationships respectively involving ancestors via direct descents upon succeeding generation links etc..
