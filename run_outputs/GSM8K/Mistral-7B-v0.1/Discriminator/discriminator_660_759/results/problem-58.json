I apologize if my original calculations led you astray due to misunderstanding your question regarding what specifically denotes as either being equal parts/terms rather than simply taking halves like previously mentioned. My apologies again; this recalculated figure aligns accurately based strictly upon explicit phrasing within initial query prompting us toward fractional consideration \u2013 hence leading me back onto accurate grounds concerning said conditionals presented alongside numerical context provided herein described.)
