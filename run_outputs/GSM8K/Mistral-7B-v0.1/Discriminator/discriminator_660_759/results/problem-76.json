Oncewards it was mentioned Boris distributes ten (`x`) units ('one') worth of apple towards Beck\u2014we could say subsequently this event reduces or elevates `(the amount Beck own[ies] minus [an individual quantity]) subtracted ([from/to `[An individuals quantity`). Thus post redistribution Beck maintains `-[(number owning Beth)(amount borrowed) plus [-([a certain unit]+[-borrowed amt.[In our context],this equates(-)[((zero)*one)+[-ten]]=negativesummed),therefore resulting in negative twenty.(minus forty divided over four yields (-))negativeteen.). Simplifying using basic algebra principles; if you omit negativities before division results:`(-)-forty/(dividedoverfour)= fortynegative(?)).
