Combine these together to find overall reduced pace with arms up: Total Tap Rate Arm Up == (`150+125`)==375Taps Per Minute .

Given that arm holding takes place over just one half second period it seems reasonable to calculate 'arm hold impact' using fractions such like; Arm Hold Time : Full dance Minutes= Fractional Tap Decrease=. It results in around decimal points representing seconds out of full length Dance Period or overall fraction(. Approx calculation suggests approx value i.e.; about (.3*seconds)/(60sec./danceMin)=approximately equals(.01); which further implies actual DANCE MINUTES FRACTION:=about ((Dance Total+ArmHoldTotal)-ArmHoldImpact))/(AroundFullLengthTapRatesInSeconds)); Hence,(About[(2mins)+(-.3 secs)]/{((around)}2*(60secs)}) =~2-(/.3)->approx val usable dancing duration=2-.3==~a little less than equal to ~1->after simplification&conversion into units yields almost exactly nearing rounded values--thus suggesting approximation close\u2248to required result..Now take next factor too---we also need consider lower speed due increased complexity thus resulting potential reduction ratios might apply hence roughly account possible slower speeds caused thereby.--herewith considering said factors yield approximate calculations leading towards closer fitting solution based upon previously provided figures-->Approaching conclusion...To finish off evaluation process involves adding individual contributions made via calculated above estimated approximated efforts wield power sufficient enough guiding toward expected resolution outcome!
