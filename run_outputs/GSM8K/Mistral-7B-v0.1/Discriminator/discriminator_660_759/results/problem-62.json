Hence, Ronal loses only about $(665-$450)=$215 because even though we may spend nearly $215 repairing or filling the hole our initial loss due not getting fined would mean spending less than without repairs making sure overall expenses come out lower compared having them fill said problem leading ultimately to higher profits etc..

Hence, plugging values into our equation; $(570)-($75)$ yields approxamtually $495 savings for him over time , assuming all stated conditions remain constant. Thus we obtain \"$495\".
