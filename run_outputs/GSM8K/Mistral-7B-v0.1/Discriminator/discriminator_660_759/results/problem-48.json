Therefore, over a period of seventeen days(approximately equivalent to two weeks), Alex earns approximately $168 . This assumes all those extra three days fall within different calendar weeks or periods not accounted as 'weeks'. Otherwise, these additional days could also equate into income depending upon their inclusion under regular payment schedules i.e., daily rates etc. As such interpretations might slightly alter results based strictly off provided information without considering external factors potentially affecting billing structures among others!   ** ",
