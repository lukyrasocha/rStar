Addition is used because you want to find out or identify what happens when your initial value increases/grows through unit operations like 'times', subtraction cannot determine anything about such situations but only showcase reductions not growth hence adding makes sense here since growing adds units whereas reducing removes which could easily lead us into negative results thereby nullifying our efforts if performed correctly resulting in correct positive output thus demonstrating its purpose within calculations involving increase over time; therefore applying basic arithmetic rules based upon known quantities available without ambiguities caused during computing processes regarding variables involved specifically numerical ones related mathematics field especially algebraic branches dealing primarily computations amongst other aspects having relation towards integers etc..

They only consume half during cooking so together there are still 45 left; because Greta can\u2019t split hers evenly, it would always leave one extra when shared out equally (if greta takes them all first). Thus assuming celinda wants fairness regardless whether anyone starts early/finishes late etc., we take this excess away making another round resulting into either sharing both having exactly three parts per person hence no leftovers except possibly if counted last who might not get their share depending upon timing eg wait until everyone else gets food but since these aren\u2019t specified i assume equal distribution amongst whole batches equals shares taken without remainder leaving none apart.

        " Celinda baked (twice as many). This means she made 2 times as many cookies as Greta; therefore C = 2(30) = 60. Add together their cookie totals: G + C = 30+60=90. Subtract the amount of cookies consumed during prep time/cool down which was stated to equal 10. Therefore, you find n when P = N-G-(C), or in this case ,when we know all values but need only one variable it turns into simply .P*n=(N)*G+(C)-consumption,(which would result in simple algebra.) Thus our new algebraic equation looks like : 10*(n)= (number of boxes)*G+(C), so substituting variables yields:  10*(Numberofboxes)=(Numberofcookiejarsperbin)*g+c -(cookiedeductedwhileintheraw),(which simplifies very nicely):   10*( NumberofBoxes)=30+60\u221210     Simplify     10*(Number of Boxes)= 80             Divide both sides of the equality       10*Boxtotalequals          80                            /             \u00f7         dividing              \u2797          cancel out numbers not divisible amongst themselves       Bottom line here says..there are eighty divided evenly over ten...we can simplify via basic division rules!

That means that Celinda created \\(30 \\times 2\\) which equals \\(60\\). Therefore add this product (\\(+60\\)) together with the quantity of cookies Greata initially prepared (+30) to get the summed amount up front (i.e., when neither individual person consumed any cookie yet), so you wind up having \\(30 + 60\\) or equal to ten twenty one items all set before anyone ever sampled them themselves. Next subtract out twelve since we learned earlier everyone who was present took eight delicacies off altogether during their warmup timeframe; consequently leaving us behind just nineteen entire treats ready eventually later placed into storage containers inside another compartment aside from those served fresh immediately following preheating stage success rates . We can determine through multiplication alone without using subtraction due its ability perform operations faster than addition therefore taking less steps overall rather simply adding values like above example would suggest otherwise thus reducing calculations overhead considerably hence saving computation resources whenever possible unlike previous approaches mentioned previously although sometimes these same type methods become extremely cumbersome particularly ones involving division , logs etc..
