Thus taking into account thirty percent damage results our result thus being :\u00a0 \\[({{\\textstyle{{\\cdot}{\\rm Student \\;windows\\; }}-\\;\\;} \\over \\;\\;} )= ({{\\rm Total\\; Windows} - \\\\hspace*{5pt}\\\\textit{(Total\\\\hspace*{2pt}\\textbf{Windows}}{\\%\\,Damaged}))\\]This simplifies down to around \\(\\boxed{140}\\) windows.
