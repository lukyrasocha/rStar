However even before going through these steps one important observation can quickly simplify our calculations considerably : Since every third person among all three kids shares identical ownership patterns regarding quantity possession levels regardless what fractional multiples come up afterwards; therefore both conditions mentioned earlier merely inform about numerical relationships rather than defining unique sizes/quantities attached individually correspondingly . Hence considering said fact simplifies everything down substantially thereby negating necessity otherwise required during preliminary stages ; ultimately leading directly towards obtaining precise results via direct arithmetic operations applied subsequently once overall sum requirements become clear instead requiring complex reorderings prioritizing order precedence over others , particularly due consideration being paid equally across groups involved while factoring relevant information accurately present within question text itself..

Create three distinctive profiles based on different customer segments identified using multivariate analysis techniques such as clustering and factor analysis. Each profile needs comprehensive behavioral characteristics like values & attitudes towards quality vs price, preferred product benefits, brand awareness levels etc., psychographics details including interests/hobbies beyond mere demographics, specific communication preferences especially media platforms used frequently along these lines. Based off your profiling results you need to propose one tailored messaging strategy per segment aiming primarily at maximizing engagement rates amongst those particular consumer groups instead offering generic business messages which could potentially fail because their relevance gets compromised due to lack of understanding underlying factors behind purchase decision processes among various consumer cohorts present within larger populations served by brands having broader appeals across markets.
