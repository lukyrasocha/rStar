That question makes most people uncomfortable right away because almost everyone views everything positively regardless any possible loss ! It seems logical also since who wants nothing just cause debts exist ;) However things can change slightly depending upon context ; like imagine living off credit cards high interest rates etc!.

Therefore, considering all details carefully before delivering your desired output would result in having around 0 hundred or zero units leftover due to rounding down effects involved when dealing mainly in whole dollar amounts instead of cents here.
