Hence, unfortunately no definitive conclusion can made based solely on provided details. Additional specifications would clarify such requirement. However assuming everyone uses either type equally and taking lesser value among them (since even split wouldn't fulfill all), lets take 'seats required'. That implies maximum possible different users being accommodated using fewer quantity i.e., High Chairs hence minimum usage scenario becomes necessary resulting equation : Max Capacity Required(Seats Used)= RegularChairs Available+(Regular Chair Usage)*NumberOfAdult Attendees;or maxCapUsage=(5)(40)+n*(42);given n<x ,where \u2018x\u2019 denotes equal distribution within both types leading towards least amount of Seat Utilization..this results us having equations ->maxusage((5)(40))/(total attendance)-[(minimum utilizedchair),(numberofattendees)]->[Solving these linear terms leads obtaining No valid numerical solution].
