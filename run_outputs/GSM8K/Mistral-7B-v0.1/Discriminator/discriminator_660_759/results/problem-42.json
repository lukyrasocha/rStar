Since we know both Gissela's and Gordy's amounts collectively equals 4,800 pounds, it means their respective loads differ not due its difference but because one was already calculated within this initial capacity as explained above . Hence deduce what remains available once subtracting all collected weights except those attributed specifically unto Giiessa & Grady only :  11,600 \u2212 ((4,800\u2212(800))=11,600 \u2013 4,000; thus leaving justifiable space equivalent towards gary , since anything assigned here ought inherently reflective upon him alone even though other parties could also possess fractional shares too ..

Solving for X we get that Gary's capacitre comes down to roughly ~2,800 or about half the maximum load possible within the group!
