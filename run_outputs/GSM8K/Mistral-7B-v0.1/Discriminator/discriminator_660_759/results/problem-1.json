Multiply the quantity needed by its unit price to find the total cost prioritizing purchases based on their importance. Here it would make sense first to focus on calculating the actual necessity: Coffee Cost: We need to multiply the increased price ($5.2/pound) times the quantities required (7 lb): Total Price Before Donuts: To get the preliminary calculation without yet considering additional items such as donuts or taxes etc., you simply perform multiplication directly associating weight units(lbs.) with dollar values$: Quantity_needed \u00d7 UnitPrice_increased => 7lb \u00d7 $5.2 / lb => $36.4 . Additional Items : Since Rogers addition involved getting him a snack too, specifically identified here being a single medium priced item; let\u2019s add up the extra spending along side calculated initial purchase amounts:$2 [donut].

Determine Roger\u2019s daily consumption as well as what this translates into over seven days because the question tells us he used up about a whole bottle every single day. We know Roger consumes roughly a gallon or equal to around fifteen pounds(rounding off assuming 'pounds')of coffee during those few hours when everyone woke up hence spending him close enough but not exactly being exact due tot deducting round numbers using estimation based on averages . Therefore multiplying all amounts involved together becomes easier if first converted them either back forth between metric /US customary unit systems depending upon their common denominator whether Imperial System vs Metric system units respectively..
