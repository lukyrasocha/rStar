Write out your calculations clearly indicating variable substitution (cCITY_nonIndustrials= ?) Apply basic operations such as subtraction followed closely by division if needed ensuring you handle numerical values correctly within parenthesis when operating addition or multiplication actions. Finalize any fractional numbers involved making sure fractions stay whole during calculation process rather than converting them prematurely to decimals except it aligns better/needed for further processing stages beyond this solution phase.

        " information which includes: Colorado City using 40% of the water; Of this usage, only 80% goes into Industrial use. Calculate firstly 'what amount (%) constitutes industrial purpose'. This equates to  40*80/100=32 %. As industry represents 32 % ,the rest not going towards it would represent as:(total)=(indus.)+non indus..or,(Non Indus)%=[(Total)]-(Indus.). Substitute values here ((x))=(40)+(-32), so,(x)=8%. Therefore X equals eight therefore representing our result i.e., Eight (8). Check if your solution makes sense within real life scenarios provided . "
