However, not all of those can actually seen due to various factors like buildings etc.; hence only 40% gets witnessed (`percentage_visible\u201d=`hp(`\"((value / 100) * ((15*20))`,integer)). Thus `(percentage_visible/100)*((value per box*no. of boxes)` becomes `\u201c(40/100) * (300\u201d,int)`, i.e.`0.4 * 300=120.\u201d Hence our next calculated value represents the viewing capacity related directly through percentage division as follows \"`viewable_city_firesunts\"` or equivalently:`[\"calculate\",\"dividend\"]`.

This tells us roughly speaking if you draw a circle around all those possible views made available via the window frame structure upwards / downwards ..this forms approximately ninety degrees considering full angles measured usually equal exactly three hundred sixty degrees ...and similarly its reasonable thus assuming evenly spaced patterns across any axis lines drawn etc., therefore meaning about seventeen units per quarter sector equalling thirty seven rounds multiplied together...whereupon taking away eighteen points based upon our initial estimate above due partly perhaps being slightly conservative yet still fair regarding accuracy ; leaving behind enough wiggle room furthermore allowing additional factors such weather conditions impacting visibility within certain bounds thereby modifying overall expectations somewhat....
