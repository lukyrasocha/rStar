To make my life easier I am going to use only units as places instead... so converting pounds back to inches lets us solve it.... which means multiplying both sides of the equation above by twelve:(9*b+10)*12=(1/1)*(8*12)+(4*12)^o..now simplify:(108*b+120)=!(96+(48)). This simplifies further down to (108*b+120)>!^[^(96+48), or simply put,(108*b+120)-(96+48). Therefore;(108*b)(removed spaces here >><<<<)!=>>(108*(8))-(96+(48)), using subtraction commutativity law.(108*(8))>(108*(8--12)), solving within brackets ,simplifying .Now divide top side by coefficient ;(bottomside divided by coef.)or :b>(96)--12 )dividing denominators across equal divides .Similarly equational steps follow ...so let kiddos work themselves through algebra ^_^ Remember if you get stuck, all help needed :) Keep trying math is fun !!
