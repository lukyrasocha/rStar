Explanation : To find out how much money the tomato vendor saves a week due to purchasing tomatoes at a cheaper rate, first calculate the difference in cost between what he paid before and what he pays now per tomato. Before, he spent \\(0.5\\) dollar per tomato, while currently spending \\(0.4\\) dollar per tomato, resulting in a saving of \\(0.1\\) dollar per tomato. Since he sells 500 tomatoes every day, multiply this amount by the volume sold over a week to get saved summed up in weekly terms \u2013 i.e., compute \\(\\frac{week }{days}(daily\\_volume)(cost_{saved})=(7)(500)(0.1)=\\$350\\).",

        " amount saved per one unit times units sold daily equals savings daily which can calculated as follows; ($0.1 X 500). Therefore Daily Savings would equal $(0.1*500) or 50$. Calculate Weekly savings (daily savings multiplied by seven because we need to know saving over whole week so it\u2019ll look like this $(50*7$)and calculating above multiplication shows us Weighty savings come out about 350$ . Thus our conclusion based upon data supplied could mean The ",
