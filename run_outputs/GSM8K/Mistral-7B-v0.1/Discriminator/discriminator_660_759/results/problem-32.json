        " a single banana costs $0.5*2=$1. Further it says oranges are the priciest ones and their unit price equals thrice of banana which means our orange cost per item is equal to $1*3=$3. Hence if we buy all things needed into making up a complete crate (which includes bananas, apples & oranges), according to what was said earlier about having them individually inside this package together; therefore ,their overall sum needs adding back .This brings forth : Cost_Per Crate=(Unit Price Bananna+ Unit Price Apple)+(Unit Price Orange)*Quantity Available Per CrateBanana:=  1Xapples:=   0.5 Xorange:=    3TotalCostForOneCrate=($1+$0.5) + ($1*$3)=$5. It\u2019s quite evident though ;that taking only these basic values alone wouldn't lead us too far hence why multiplication occurred herebefore ! As soon as those computations get carried out properly alongwith proper summation process itself being applied sequentially over time without any shortcut attempts taken either way towards simplifying steps involved whilst trying solving problems directly through mathematical formulas instead opting firstly understanding conceptually well enough thus allowing extraction benefits obtained postward analysis phase especially once reaching conclusion point within specific case scenarios encountered due course while performing calculations required throughout entire lengthy procedure undertaking..It goes underway smoothly resulting mainly based off fundamental concepts learned around arithmetic operations combined seamlessly via algebraic equations utilising symbols representing quantities represented explicitly visibly during every stage progressively ensuring clear direction ahead maintainable coherence even amidst increasing complexity thereby preserving accurate solution outcome till very last possible moment attained despite potential issues arisen anywhere else prior eventually culminating nicely upon completion successfully yielding satisfactory results achieved right away no further adjustments necessary subsequently!

We calculate everything up until division sign first because multiplication comes before addition when you follow order rules according PEMDAS law.. As no parentheses specified anywhere during execution means operation executes right\u2013left through those operators without interruption causing nothing but simplification till remaining single numerical result appears.(So No operator precedence issue appeared). Finally putting your question statement inside () brackets shows explicit requirement saying dividing happens only after adding operations , so our expected output remains same too :) Hopefully understood !!!
