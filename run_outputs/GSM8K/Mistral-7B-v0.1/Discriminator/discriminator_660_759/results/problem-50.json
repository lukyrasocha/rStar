        " Total cost without discount = (5*$3) + (4*$2.50) + (3*$4) + (13*$1). Subtract or add all those totals up; you get ($15+$10+$12+13)= $50. Apply the coupon rate which takes away ten percent i.e., $(0.10)*(total amount)$= $.10*. We subtract this value form our original equation as follows:$50-$(.10*$50=$)(or just calculate it directly,$50-.1*50= $45), so we round down because .1 represents one dollar bills while .5 only half dollar coins cannot represent decimal points but whole numbers like full denominations. Therefore the correct rounded formula would look something along these lines..($50-($.10*\\$50))/$\\frac{1}{10}= \\$50-\\$(\\frac{\\\\1}{\\\\10})=\\ \\$50 -\\$.\\overline{1}=\\ \\$ (\\text {rounded })$.

Apply 10% discount because Marcus showed his loyalty card at checkout, so multiply original amount ($50), with 0.9 representing its value decreased by the rate mentioned above (= .1 or 10%).

        " With 5 croissants it comes up as (5)(3) which equals 15. One set of fourteen loaves cost ($2.50). To get this you multiply(4)(2.5)=$10. Another batch was priced @($4.00/piece), so we can simply write them as follows,(3)*(4)=$12. And finally one dozen miniature muffins came (@$)1 each:(13)(1)=$13.. All together these add ((15)+(10)+(12)+(13))= 40 before tax or discount!. We know Marc receives a ten percent discount (.10*.40=.4.) because .1*(.40/.10.=.4)). So using subtraction((.40)-(.40)=$.0). Thus Marco\u2019s actual charge would equal $(40-.4)$=$39.(Certainly not your usual calculation!)
