Thus you want (and I suppose your teacher or homework wants) fractional values; write out three fractions which make sense based upon reading the above sentences carefully:  1).

Multiply both ratios across numerator denominators yielding equal results such your fraction expression remains unchanged overall proportion despite changing variables along every single line including multiplication factors involved here due their symmetry properties among similar operations like division etc., hence maintain exact similarity throughout entire process leading onto eventual conclusion!

Therefore Time taken bw both cats and dogs together would be  30+20 =>T = 50 seconds . Finally divide T which results from adding their rates multiplied by Rate difference divided by combined rate or ((a\u2212b)+(a+b))\u00f7(2ab).

I hope you understand my message ; if not clarify here! :) The answer is: 1/5. ",

We convert minutes into seconds\u2014 since one minute equals sixty secondes, thirty minutes turns out equaling ninety seconds; thus, our equivalent ratio becomes \\( \\frac{9\\:sa\\::9}{90} \\) or simply converting it as fractions using division operation \\(\\frac{9}{90}= \\frac{1}{10}\\), stating every ten segments correspond respectively when calculating hours against said quantity (\\(a\\) denotes any variable representing countable elements--eaten items within this scenario) .
