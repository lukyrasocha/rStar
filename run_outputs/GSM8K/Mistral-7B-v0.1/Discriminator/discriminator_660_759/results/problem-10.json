        " (Robert) + 5 pounds (Cindy) + 4 pounds (Aaron) equals 12 pounds altogether before sharing. They want to divide this fairly amongst themselves so it means dividing the sum total evenly into individual shares among three individuals; hence every one gets approximately equal portions when shared which implies you need to perform division operation here. Hence, simply calculate 'total_candy / no_of_people'. That translates as follows:'12 (the combined weight in pounds initially held collectively)/3(number representing persons)', resulting in roughly '4/pound per person.' Therefore if we look carefully, everyone ends up having around or exactly four pounds since whole numbers can not normally break apart unlike fractions during divisions \u2013 unless rounding was needed but your question didn\u2019t ask about approximate values either way meaning precise calculations only required making sure both numerator & denominator involved integers while still being accurate reflective totals using provided data set information correctly thus following these steps allows us solving problems related ones successfully without error occurrence nor unexpected misjudgments arising due incorrect interpretation applied incorrectly especially relatable numerical context specific scenarios like those mentioned above..

Conclusively, everybody ends receiving approximately 4 pounds. This means since dividing whole numbers can lead sometimes to decimals as answers not having fractions or exact values but approximations based off division scenarios like this example we see above leads us back again into math lessons around divisions involving mixed units such as combining feet & inches!

Henceforth, every one receives around four pounds of sweetness depending upon practical distribution rules decided amongst themselves, but strictly speaking mathematically according to rounded figures when dealing with real world situations involving discrete units (like bags), exact numbers can sometimes vary because fractional portions don\u2019t always work seamlessly practically unless specific measures allow flexible divisions.

Thus dividing 12/3 yields you getting back to equal amounts per person. Hence every individual ends having 12 / 3 =>  4 units of candy. That means all agreed upon sharing leads everyone ending with having only four pound( or similarly four unit) worth of these sweets shared amongst friends post division. Therefore, assuming no additional purchases made before distribution; 'Each friend gets exactly same quantity namely...'. Each friend receives precisely identical weight distributed according as well calculated earlier.. Equal part ensures fairness towards everybody involved here since not just anybody gains favor due any special circumstance nor anyone loses anything unintentionally accidental way!

Add this amount together with four (Aaron) adds up also to make eight; which when shared out evenly among three equals roughly about nearly equal parts or around one pound per person . But since we can\u2019t actually divide these candies into perfect thirds without cutting them individually if required , rounding off it comes down approximately to close but not exact division : \u2248 Two whole extra pieces remain undistributed under realistic circumstances! So rounded approximate answers could either work depending upon specific requirements such as whether leftover amounts count towards any totals etc., typically though generally speaking however...

Since three people need to split it evenly amongst themselves so you divide the amount (total) by the number who needs equal amounts which means dividing this value by three. Each person therefore receives exactly four pound sixteen twenty fifth (.25). But since we usually deal with weight rounded down, instead, because one cannot possess fractions of grams or kilograms when dealing physically such as can happen here. And if you want further precision than .25 but lesser accuracy consider adding up additional figures until reaching your desired point; let\u2019s say ten decimal places equals very accurate division however not practical often due its nature requiring complex algorithms beyond everyday calculations!
