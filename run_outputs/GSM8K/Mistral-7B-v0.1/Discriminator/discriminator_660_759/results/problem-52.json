Calculate how many candies Ginger and Amy eat over these 14 days using their daily consumption rate respectively (for example, if you subtract the product obtained when multiplying by taking into account the individual piece consumed). Multiply this value times three minus four plus one hundred since all values begin off equal; therefore calculate ten less than ginger\u2019s count compared to amy but still starting at same thousand initially because none was stated differently..

Therefore since we assumed G&A initially shared same amount of HC , subtracting 28 leaves Amy having exactly like Ginge . But if you consider their initial equal split of the candies separately ; while calculating differences in consumption rates due to faster decay rate in value associated wth speedier devourings during said period...then : AMY WOULD STILL REMAIN BEHIND THE MARGIN WITH SHE OWNING DIFFERENTLY LESS CANDY !!!

This question seems complex due largely because its asking about time passing rather than simple subtraction or division which can make problems involving repeated actions like 'weekly', 'biweekly' seem confusing despite using numbers such quantities daily / hourly intervals etc...

        " = 21 pieces. Initially they both had 100 candies so Amy still has (100 \u2013 21)  \u2248 79 candies remaining but ginger only has (100 \u2013 28). This means after one week Amy already gained over (79 \u2212 72 )=   7 units ahead than ginger when considering individual amounts consumed per day. Considering just their totals we know amy needs to gain another seven before reaching double digits difference since this represents exactly twice what ginger consumes daily amount i.e., same as initial situation because initially it was said \u201cthey BOTH\u201d eat these quantities. Thus finally answering question asked about \u201chow MUCH MORE WILL AMY HAVE AFTER TWO WEEKS\u201d. We multiply above found differences due occurrences within periods involved thus needlessly complex solution which could very easily not even get correct results if mistakes occurred throughout calculations made without attention paid specifically keeping track off all relevant figures presented along way during problem solving process..

At first, they both had equal amounts of candies so when you subtract it out what\u2019s remained (both combined) was zero or nothing since neither one would own anything individually; no matter which method we choose however if any calculation gets performed regarding only individual totals without incorporating this fact into account\u2013i believe those results may vary quite significantly among sources leading up until eventually reaching conclusions like these made here above based upon general knowledge about averaging figures across multiple scenarios involving varying factors such as daily consumption rates amongst differing participants within same category groupings over specified period lengths etc... Thus concluding my analysis doesn't really support your specific scenario being accurate even though similar principles apply!",

This means that if they keep this up over a period of exactly one month(i.e., four weeks), all we need to calculate here is just double that value or twice as above which comes out to be : 2*79=158. Hence amy would ultimately own 'seven hundred fifty plus seventy eight less' i.e. 'six hundred seven less'. We round down our result since it\u2019d not make sense for us to say someone could possibly possess .7 pieces when talking about wholes numbers; thus six hundreds seventy three being rounded off becomes , \u2018one thousand minus half forty.\u2019 Final ",

To find out which person would still possess most sugar we compare them directly i.e., taking subtraction form ginger\u2019s count wrt amy\u2019s : 58 \u2013 44 = 14 .
