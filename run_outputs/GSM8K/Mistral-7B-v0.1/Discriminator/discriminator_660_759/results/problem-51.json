        " $1.50. If Erin had  $6.00, how many scoops of ice cream could she purchase considering their promotion ? Because you can exchange every pair (every set of two), it stands to reason that since everyone gets one extra when buying multiples of three or sixteen units , anyone who spent less than half as before would still receive something 'extra'. Thus all people whose spendings fall under the midpoint point, no matter whether those expenses add up to evenly divisible quantities which require exchanges due totals above them, but below said points such quantity amounts themselves always stand nonetheless eligible fo being split twice upon purchases ; thus resulting into trios altogether composed exclusively off these particular items without further complications arising either ways .

",
        " We can calculate the maximum possible quantity without considering any deals as follows; divide the amount ($6) available to purchase among individual items (each unit selling for $1.5): this yields three units or scoops. Yet, we know per offer made by Ice Cream Parlour : Buy Two Scoops ; Get One FREE! With such understanding ,we conclude that buying four scoops would still only cost him/her six since every third one comes gratis .

        " Erin has $6. Calculate maximum possible full sets she can purchase using up every dollar evenly under current conditions (buy one, pay for another). Since both prices share multiples three ways ($1.50), we would break down Erin\u2019s potential purchases into groups consisting only twice purchased items which could use their third \u201cfree\u201d item before going over available funds \u2013 or not accounting fro additional charges based upon individual circumstances beyond those described here! Divide our budget equally among these packages; divide it further if necessary until all remaining change remains less than what needs buying again within said cycle\u2026 Or just start adding/adding smaller units instead starting directly away without trying any sort calculation methods because sometimes doing things manually yields different outcomes compared w/ automated processes especially during unusual situations like this scenario provided below... Buy pairs first & add single ones last time round considering savings gained accordingly..

This comes down to taking the $6.00 Erin has ($ which represents M) divided by 'the cost per item'. Since we know one scoop normally sells for $1.50 ('C'), therefore if no special conditions apply you could calculate as follows; $$M=\\frac{N \\cdot C}{V}.$$ With this equation N being equal to quantity purchased while V equalling value per purchase/item ($=1$).

Hence, if Erin spends all her money available exactly according to prices mentioned above while taking full advantage of promotions offered, she ends up purchasing twelve overall or seventeen considering discount deals made through bulk orders worth around ten USD rather than twenty; meaning that under such circumstances making optimal use over already limited finances could mean acquiring near about double quantities compared against direct expenditures alone..
