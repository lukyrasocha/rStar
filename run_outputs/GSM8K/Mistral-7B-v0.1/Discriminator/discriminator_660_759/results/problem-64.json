        " slice count per person (pizzas). Doing this calculation provides us with a grand total of all the sliced food available; namely 5*12=60 slices before any were consumed because everyone brought one serving size(pizza) . Calculate what fraction was not eaten initially as it\u2019ll save time instead going backward through calculations when we figure out those amounts weren't totally eaten.. First up ,calculate which portion wasn't finished yet since half remain untouched due either being vegetarian or other preferences besides ones wanting full servings.; hence only seven quarterths would get enjoyed while majority stayed uneaten leaving three sixthteenth parts undone : [(7/8)*x]/[(7/8)+((2)/8)]=(7\u00d712):[7+2]=<<[(7/8)*12/(7/8+2/8)]=[7\u202212]:(7+2)=[[total_left:=16]] ; Second part deals about fourth portions just follow similar logic except use quarters rather than halves::([5*(3/4)])\u221712:[][\r",
        " slices. Since we need to calculate this considering portion consumed by both groups mentioned i.e., those who eat 2/3rd of their pizzas or 2 out of three equal parts consume only 2 parts / every part which can also mean multiplying it half times. Similar approach applies here but subtracting instead because all what remains forms untouchable portion . Hence , since these portions differ among different individuals involved multiply accordingly : Total Slices Eaten= [No.]of People(P)*Number Of Pizzas Ordered*(Portion_A)(Eaters)=   NumberOfPeople*NumberOfOrdered_PerPerson*portionFirstGroup+ NoPeopl\u0435 * order Per Person_second Group(CPE=(CE)- Consumed ExcessPart)/TotalExcessDividedByDenominator ((ConsumedEXcess Part )/(denom)/consumption rate)+Remaining Portion Not touched((TOTALSlices)_-(total consumed)) Calculate first group as follows:- First Groups Contribution:       Quantity      Projection            Peanuts     Nut Butter        Likes    Enjoyed         Dislikes    Wasted         Gap             Count               Extra          Value           Intercept                 Second Group Calulation:: Similarly find values corresponding third value ie:(firstgroupvaluefromintersection-extraterritorysegmentationcount)\r",
        " individual orders. To calculate this quantity you multiply together both values using multiplication which results into;  60*\u2154=40 . Next find out what fraction amount came from other two friends among all group members combined. Other Friends eat \u00beth (four fifths or \u00be), therefore calculating it equals to ;   60*(1-(\u2153+(\u00be)))*. Calculate inside parentheses first adding fractions while converting them overto common denominators respectively i.e.; ,\u00bc+\u00be becomes {1(1/4)+1(3/4)} /4{which converts to}1/(4). Therefore resultant value gets simplified as follows :1 \u2013 [(\u00bd)/2]x60.=    60 - [\u00bd)(60)=      60 -(30)=         30. Final Step Combine these numbers resulting from previous calculations yielding actual food consumed within your initial question via addition followed up by subtraction operation hence obtain respective quantities available following meal consumption through simple mathematic calculation namely summing calculated portions subtracting said sums from overall totals likewise presented below:- Total Food Consumed=(Total Quantity Initial Order\u00d7Fraction Eaten By First Two Individuals Purchaser)- Additional Food Gobbled UpBy Second Group Of Two MembersPurchasing.(Referring Backwards Towards Equation Number One )Final RemaindersAvailablePostMealEtiquetteCalculationsForYourCloselyScrutinized ",

        " =  5 + ~2.66... or about 2 full slices plus another slice because you can\u2019t get half a human! Both other groups eat almost identical amounts but not quite as high up so it would look like this: Total Eaten From One Group 1 Whole Pizza Plus Another Half \u279d First Friends Consumed . When adding fractions make sure your denominator matches up even if one fraction already fits perfectly into its whole part first time around. This works best using common multiples instead; therefore making conversions easy before beginning any calculations which we know aren\u2018t always fun especially when dealing directly wiht numbers ratherthan percentages etc\u2026 Here again though let me show why our third example isn'thappy either way considering every single bit counts whether big enough alone makes sense within itself without having additional context provided otherwise someone might find themselves wondering who exactly finished what portion thus confusing things further down road based purely upon individual interpretation only---which really shouldn`nt come close here since these situations often require precise descriptions explaining details clearly right away whenever possible such critical clarity needed just prior understanding throughout conversation..

        " how many slices these two first mentioned friends ate together. We know that both friends eat 2/3 of one pizza which equals (2/3)*12=8 slices per friend because we want it only referring to people who didn\u2019t take whole pizzas or shared them equally like here. As such, those guys consumed 8*2=<<2*8=16>>16 slices combined. Calculate how many pizzas the last pair of customers took altogether based off fractions above; half remained undisposed so . Given this factual statement ,the portion taken was therefore (.4-.6)*.5=.5+=(.). Hence They finished another full slice(half). To calculate leftover amounts determine sum of individual quantities subtracting totals as following : Total amount purchased less consumption leads into ; Slices Left Over=Total Quantity Available-Quantity Consumed. Work out sums accordingly.. 60-(5+(16)+(.5))=  60 \u2013 [5 (+]\u2192[16]+[]->=21 ) ->    60\u201321= -->      39 answersheets remain unconsumed. "
