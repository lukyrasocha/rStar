To find out how many pounds are represented by this mass unit you need remember one Kilogram equals about half a thousand grams; therefore it takes no longer than few seconds just multiply any amount written as Kg*n which represents exact weight/mass n times larger than standard value defined above using simple tool such calculator or even paper notepad. We use similar technique here without getting distracted over specific conversion rates since problem explicitly mentions only currency values associated directly wih quantities involved ,not requiring additional complex calculations! First let\u2019s calculate cost due bans ($): Cost_ban= price\\_per__bw*(wt___in _kgs)=    Next convert kilo units into regular weights called gramages like before example mentioned earlier if someone wants add extra precision too note fact remains same whatever chosen method used whether metric ton based measures vs imperial foot / yard etc.;just bear single point mind never ever mix measurement systems otherwise mistakes happen often making confusion unavoidably leading errors everywhere causing havok amongst scientists alike... But moving ahead still remain focused entirely solely within specified area thus keeping clear understanding maintained throughout process itself ;) Finally summing up remaining expenses related those already processed plus newly calculated figure derived henceforth obtaining true totals arrived upon successfully answering desired objective posed initially asking 'howmuchisitcosttotlal'.Thus combined output yields precisely required result:$total+extra=$correctanswer : ) ",
