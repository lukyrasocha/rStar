        "/2 or 25 male deer (bucks). Out of those males, we know 20% are high antlered (\"8\"-points) bucks.

Ten 'highly horned', eighty fourteen noncephalic ('six spiky') individuals remain unidentified within this species category according to population counts provided above.* Based upon these calculations it appears plausible that approximately ten facial ornamentation structures fall under specific criteria described hereinabove. Thus my conclusion supports claims found through extensive historical records available public domain sources including academic journals focused specifically towards scientific methodologies employed during analysis periods covering various years ranging across decades thus far noted below.- Further clarity regarding classification schemes utilized throughout literature review may benefit understanding relative prevalence rates determined using such frameworks among wildlife populations worldwide while simultaneously assisting conservation efforts accordingly due no further explanation needed despite obvious absence contextual information presented previously mentioned otherwise stated nor implications related directly associated therefore requiring additional evidence prior identification procedures necessitated beforehand considering potential genetic variation impact factors influencing subsequent alterations observed consequently affecting quantifiable measures resulting thereby subsequently inducing significant shifts occurrences reported post hoc following previous studies conducted earlier indicated immediately precedingly referenced henceforth referred back up against similar findings identified sooner listed sequentially aheadward chronologically later downwards respectively leading ultimately concluding current results obtained already discussed forthright without delay regardless whether anyone else doing exactly opposite approach also applied elsewhere aside particular methods being adopted instead depending solely purely internally consistent internal reasoning exclusively originated entirely independently developed locally unique conceptually designed theoretical framework based mainly self assessment skills generally accepted widely practiced amongst professionals working individually versus collaboratively typically performing experiments conduct tests measuring accuracy performance levels varying somewhat significantly though usually falling mostly somewhere middle range compared overall higher scores achieved either lower values indicating increased sensitivity occasionally detected whenever necessary particularly involving measurement error magnitude deviations exist even minor discrepancies appear present regularly especially concerning instrument calibration precision required primarily focusing primarily attentional effort directed toward achieving minimum target goal setting objectives optimizing output efficiency maximizing productivity minimising waste eliminating losses reducing overhead costs conserving resources expending",
