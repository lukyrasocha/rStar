Is it correct to use this name since generally people refer them directly without using any numerical value like quantity while discussing what was offered / shared amongst family/friends?. As @dariusm says consider replacing {Friend} part with actual names i.e cousins , brothers etc.. Also note that your question talks about sharing among siblings . Not all families may follow such convention hence you might want check validity before generalizing over large data sets .. Consider other variants too not just having older ones but also newer folks involved ... Family structures vary thus considering only old traditional patterns would make assumptions leading into erroneous results ! Hence proceed accordingly based upon context specific variables & relations within individual households under study .... Keep refining approach till desired accuracy level reached... Good Luck!
