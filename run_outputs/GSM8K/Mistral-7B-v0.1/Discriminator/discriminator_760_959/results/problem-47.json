With a single bag holding 72 chips, Two Bags contain twice this amount resulting in 72+72=144 chips in total. Given we need only 36 chips to cover three-inch depth; Thus dividing our available quantity(144) by what we use(36),we get  144/36 ===> results into four .

Therefore, if 4 times something is equal to 144, you divide 144/4= 36 inches as your result. Thus, using all available supplies, the length or width could potentially reach up to six feet because 3*(length), when multiplied together would still yield eighty four squares (the same amount present).
