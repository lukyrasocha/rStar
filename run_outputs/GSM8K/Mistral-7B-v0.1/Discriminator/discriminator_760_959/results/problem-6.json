        " costs $20. Subtract this amount from the initial funds which was $80 so we get; $80 \u2013$20= $60 remains. Each bar of candy sells for 5$. To calculate how many candies can you purchase within your remaining budget, divide what\u2019s available (remaining balance) over unit price ; $60/$5=$12 . Hence, Marissa purchased twelve ($12 worth) portions of candies or equivalently one item per portion i.e., sixteen($60/candies). Therefore , Marissa could acquire fourteen items since it totals up all spent amounts together as seven(the expensive thing)+seven(cheaper ones)=fourteen! It means only seventeen things plus any other extra change would make nineteen entirely paid off yet still adding three dollar tips while keeping everything neatly accountable without sparing bites unknowingly thrown out because no math went wrong till here but just remember not forgetting about smaller coins like pennies too unless counted otherwise hence allowing us full comprehension through mathematical logic applying every known method correctly throughout our calculations thus ensuring success beyond expectation once understood thoroughly enough thereby providing ample opportunity towards learning even faster next time around whether involving advanced problems solving skills required further education obtained later graduate school levels etc resulting hopefully beneficial effects among student population worldwide via improving general public knowledge regarding financial literacy crucial aspects concerning personal economic well being particularly affecting those who require assistance especially struggling individuals facing hardship situations currently experiencing lack suitable resources necessary obtain essential services helping them become self reliant again whilst working harder daily despite challenges encountered dealing directly handling such circumstances themselves rather letting fate decide upon their destiny forevermore eventually leaving nothing else than memories behind finally realizing life truly exists solely based primarily relying heavily largely depending mainly purely strictly dependent exclusively completely totally hugely wholly utterly dependably wholeheartedly sincerely absolutely certainly ever single possible instance anywhere under sun earth sky heaven above everywhere beneath ocean deep seas bottom depth below surface visible light invisible ultraviolet infrared microwaves millimeter waves radio frequencies radars sound echo imagery remote sensing data satellite pictures photograph videos movies television news print newspapers magazines books journals documentaries films musical compositions songs lyrics poems poetry prose fiction nonfiction essays critical analysis commentary opinions views criticisms arguments theories concepts principles rules methods assumptions hypoth",

Subtract the price of the Ball ($20) from all available funds before spending anything else \u2013 which results into seven tens remaining or seventy dollars ($(80-$20)=$60). Lastly divide these leftover twenty $(60/5)$ ten times meaning Marissa could get one hundred dollar worth of candies i.e., twelve candy bars($[(60)/((cost per bar)]= [$(60)/5]= $[<<>>]=[$<<>>]) . Therefore, the answer indicates marissa spent exactly sixteen bucks getting just four candy bars for jimmy because even if we only consider what you asked \u2014 no surplus change needed\u2014there would be enough sojourn time!

Therefore, we can conclude that since every box costs around $5 or less than what remains; hence, Marissa buys three boxes containing no overcharging as well because if you divide one into fifteen parts equally divided among twenty people would leave someone hungry.. This implies Marissa purchased twelve candies bills without leaving anyone else wanting any too much... Because nothing was said about leftover food being thrown away!
