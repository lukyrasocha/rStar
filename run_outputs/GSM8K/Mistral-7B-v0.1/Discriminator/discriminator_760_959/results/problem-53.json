Thus this division fails under conditions requiring equality unless someone gets fewer or everyone shares differently.(Because while using divisible operations like multiplication/division require no remainder(which these guys don\u2019t get)).

Since both boys like the same amount as themselves (since neither says anything about changing their preferences), it means that if you divide those evenly amongst them, we would get the equation  14 / 2= ? . And so we see right away what the correct value ought to be since these numbers divide cleanly which results into simply adding the numerals up resulting to fourteen divided by twenty equals seven. Therefore not every child gets seventeen but instead exactly just over six each getting close to around nearly seven when rounded off because rounding down always keeps everyone fairer while splitting equally allotments less children benefit slightly thus keeping things closer towards equal sharing overall especially considering human nature biases toward individual differences rather than group consensus regardless sometimes people may indeed argue differently according too personal perspective therefore making exact equality difficult due such intricate psychology within us humans however nobody feels bad either way thanks mostly likely mainly purely out matterfactoeshownwhenlookingattheseanswerssoitactuallynotthatbadwithregardsconsiderationorconcernbutstillihopeforyoudidfindthishelpfulperhapsjustingeneralsomeonedesirestoalwaystryhardnodestandjudgeotheroptionsunlessnecessityabsolutelydemandssuchdecisionmakingwhichthenseemsquitereasonableimaginetwomalechildrendebatingoveraweeklongsummervacationsplanningtripbudgetspassportissuesfinancedebtsettlementlifecarecarecostschoolfeefamilytimecommitmentdecisionshoweverbothkidsloveschesarchicalstyleactivitiesalongthewaysomeinterestswhichtheyoverlaplikebasketballvolleyballfootballbaseballdiscussthesignificancesofdifferentprospectsoftentimeavailabilitydesiredqualityexperienceexpecteddurationpreferredlocationwhereasothercommonlikingsuchmovieshorsetravellingcomputersgamingonlinechattingetcthereusethereissimplicityinthoughtprocesswithoutcomplicatedlanguageuseanytingbeyondbasicunderstandingamidordinarycommonalanguagefamil",

Still assuming equal division i.e., without dropping count but as fractional values hereafter comes up as follows; per child original ones/total(=18/35)= 1 remainder 17 -> new value becomes twice smaller (i.e .5 times due sharing), thus resulting being lesser than their initial counts before including any dropcount while keeping consistency toward proportionality across all involved participants namely John & Season etc..
