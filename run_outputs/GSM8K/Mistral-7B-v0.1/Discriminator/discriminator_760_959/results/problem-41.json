Multiply them together since every student gets one seedling; so we get `Number_of_Students`= Number_Of_Classes* No_of_students/class=`No_of_Seedlings`. Next calculate the number of employees (=Teachers). Since it says three times as often you find another adult who teaches but isn\u2019t listed here, let this amount also not count towards these numbers.: `number_ofteachers`: Tutoring Staff.*Class:`no_classes`: Teacher(`number_ofteachers`)+Student.`total_plantings`: Seedlins (`No_of_seedlings`). We can plug all values into our formula to solve what was asked which translates mathematically into : Total Trees=(Total Students)+(2*(Number_Of_Teachers)).

        " students to find out if all students participated during the reforestation drive; this results in:  40 (classes) x 25(students/class) = 1000 children participate in the event. Each student plants one sapling, so we can assume the same amount was used i.e., They would also collectively contribute around 1000 young seedlings through their initiative. Teachers plant twice as fast considering they go beyond just 'one'. As such it follows thus : three teaching staff members / 40th multiplied by twentyfive leads upwards towards ninety or about seventy-seven plus thirty individuals teach across these forty blocks , creating double those figures when combined hence making them approximately four hundred seventy-four sapslings. Combining both efforts yields roughly fifty seven thousand eight hundred minus sixty six ones since subtracting seeds collected together makes sense . All taken into account equals somewhere close but not quite perfect which requires careful calculation without actually dividing things like humans nor assigning fractions here because every person who contributes affects overall outcome differently based off different circumstances including location area within campus etc..
