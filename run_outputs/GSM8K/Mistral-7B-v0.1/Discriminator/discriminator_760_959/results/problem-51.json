However this figure represents all seven days so next calculation needs to determine daily progress i.e., dividing 420 branches over span of one week(seven days)[420 / 7], resulting roughly around ~60 [approx.] as our approximation since exact calculations may vary due to roundings applied. Thus it seems reasonable if assuming 'each day was treated equally,' therefore estimated figures show about sixty[60 approx.] clusters ascended every single diurnal period or 'average.'
