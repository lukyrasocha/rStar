When driving, they travel 50miles/hour times time spent driven; this equals (hours traveled)x(driving_speed). Substituting known values yields  56*(drive_time)=total_distance. Drive time can thus equal [(travel_to)+(hike)]/(average_drive_rate), or [((6 hr)(hiking pace))+(33.75 mi)]/(50 mpH)=[(0.9+33.75)/50]= 2 . Thus ,their destination lies approximately ((given)). To verify our work we see that if you multiply one side here with ten twice as long trips result! This concludes my explanation henceforth !

        " find out how fast they walked while hiking. Half their driving speed would be 50 / 2 = 25 mph. Since they hiked 5 miles per hour slower, their walking speed was 25 - 5 = 20 mph. Next, let\u2019s calculate the distance covered during both travel modes separately. While driving (driving time=6h) they went 6*50=300 miles. When Hiking (hike time=1.5hr), they traveled  1.5*20=<<1.5*20=30>>30miles. To get the total distance visited , combine these distances : Total Distance Visited=Driving+Hiking Travel=<<6*50+1.5*20=320>>320M. Their vacation location is thus located exactly 320 miles away!

But using Time*Distance/(Speed)^2 would require another variable called r which doesn't exist!

        " we can write equation as: (x) = (25 - 5). Therefore, the average rate during trekking equals twenty kilometers/hour. Calculate time spent while traveling before hitting roadblock or difficulty area using formula 'time taken=total distance divided by relative velocity'. Since no such obstacle obstructs our movement till arrival lets assume constant speeds throughout journey.. Hence; Time_drives+Time_hikes = Total Hours Allowed i.e., 6 ; Dividing above relation over common element Distance Travelled ,we get: Td/(td)+Th(tg)=Ta . Substituting values : 6 / [(td/(5))+(th)/(20)] ; td=[ta*((th)/(20))] [5]+[tha] Using known information ta=6 Th=(1.5); Rearranging terms yields :  1. ___ Equations Should Be Set Up Based on Known Information You know which variable represents what quantity. This makes writing equations simpler because you don\u2019t need special symbols like greek letters since English variables work nicely. When setting up your model set everything equal except unit units if needed Use clear labels Make sure numbers follow words Clearly delineate all cases Write down assumptions Check whether these match intuitive expectations Example Here let \u201cH\u201d represent height achieved while climbing Mount Everest Note We also implicitly assumed air resistance would only slightly affect us so could ignore its effects Finally assuming gravity stays approximately constant everywhere ensures simplified calculations Remember always review algebra rules Applied here mainly distributive property subtraction division addition etc General knowledge about geometry trigonometry calculus Linear Systems Solving Pairs Of Simultaneous Equations Three Methodologies Are Common One direct substitution Two linear combination method Another way solves one via elimination substitute result into other last technique often easier But First Some Basics Previously mentioned techniques belong under Systemic Algebra And More Special Cases May Occur Sometimes Like Quadratic Function Related With Parametric Form Or Even Trigonometric Inequality Problem Given Initial Variables Assign Symbolically Each Variable Defines Something Quantitative Such As Speed Elevation Temperature Mass Energy Per Unit Area Etc Second Step Link Values To Mathematical Operators Conjunction Logical \u2018AND\u2019 Disjunction Ological \u2018OR Between Conditions Combine Expressions Employ Arithmetic Laws Keep Track Of What Every Operation Signifies Third",
        " time spent driving (6 hours) by the average driving speed (50 mph). This equals 6 times 50 which equates to 300 miles traveled while driving. Similarly, calculate the distance covered during the trek by identifying its length as being equal to the product of one\u2019s travel rate (x), representing the daily pace taken during walking or running, and duration; here these variables represent x=20miles/hr*1.5hours so you get .(give your answer in decimal form up to two places behind comma.) \u00d7 1.5 yields approximately , therefore we conclude that the sum of both distances \u2014the ones attained through vehicular movements along road networks\u2014and those acquired over landmasses using foot traffic amounts to ..

        " traveling 50*6=<<50*6=300>>300. During those other four times or 24 minutes (hours subtract), which amounts to 4/6= 2/3 ,they traveled faster due to no traffic since only walking would make you slower . That equals another (2/3)x(t+b)=[(2/3)*((4-(d))+(y))] ; substituting our known values results into [(2/3)*((4-(6)/(m)))]+[((2/3)(y)]=z; plugging numbers yields  \u2248 [(-1.6)+2]= ~0.4 km; round off answers leads to z=.4km distance walked.. Thus adding both totals gets to Z=(wasted trip amount )+walking distanace : w=[[[(300)-[(.4/(kmpc*(meterspermile)).]]]].

Adding these numbers together yields (300+7.5), bringing me finally to my last calculation being..a little something like this...the answer: 307.5!
