This would mean multiplying the duration (in this case 4 hours) by his average biking speed; doing so results into covering a distance of approximately 32 miles. Addition allows us calculate the additional distance traversed while undergoing further breakless cycling activity as documented within the question. With a continued movement pattern maintained throughout these subsequent six hours implies adding up those values too resulting onto accounting an extra measure equaling about 48 miles being accrued over such interval(period).

During next period of time when taking break it means not covering any distances i.e., (break)=(0 mil.) Thus second instance was only `[((8 mph)*(6 hrs))+ ((brea k length)]`, which equals [(48)+(0 )] or equal [48]. Adding both parts together totals up as [32]+[48]=[80], so Total Distance Covered would be equivalent to value mentioned below . It seems like this instruction requires additional information about what happens during the duration while breaks are taken; therefore, based solely on provided data, conclusion points toward 80miles being overall coverage without considering those periods spent stationary.

Thus one cannot confirm based on current information whether he maintained exactly eight mph throughout his entire trip if there could possibly occur intermittent periods during the latter stages when maybe due perhaps to fatigue he couldn\u2019t maintain his initial average but still managed somehow cover similar distances within less intervals causing overall increase despite lower specific pmph averages midway around(like say going uphill would cause slowdown).
