This exercise demonstrates fundamental arithmetic operations applied within practical situations like using fractions representing lengths or units such as time and distance measurements.

Therefore simply doubling our current result gets desired outcome :) Result:-(Remainder Of First+Second)-remaining Thrid-(summation):=-(2mm)+(-8mm)+(-12mm).....and converting into fractional representation :-= -(2)/(12+8+12))...hence overall combined measure equalling value :-) Let\u2019s convert these amounts back into fractions; you divide numerator (total unfilled inches ) by common divisor among them ie greatest common factor of Numerators ;In case Greatest Common Divisor doesn \u2019t exist amongst numbers provided firstly find LCM out if Possible later Proceed accordingly Based Upon your request And based upon context I assume Total Un-Filled Fraction Parts Equals Half Portion Value Or else What Ever Remainding Left Should Sum Up To Mentioned Valued Halt !! Remember That You Could Consider Using GCD Before Going Anywhere Later As Most Efficient Way ;) Hope This helps ::DHVWBZLXQF:: Thankss Please!! Happy Learning!!! Have Fun Math Enjoy Your Day! (:*",
        " its unused part which was calculated as (1-(1/6))=5/6 of it so 5/6*12mm=10mm but when calculating this let us divide both numerator and denominator into common factor  10x2 / 6 x 2 =>10/12 mm .For the next ones use same steps :(4) \u2013 (1-(2/3))=(4-(1/3)) or ((4\u00d73)-(1\u00d73))/(3)= (12\u20133)/3=>9/3mm ,(9x2 ) / 3 \u00d72 =>18/6mm ;Similarly,(6 - (1-(1/2))) becomes((6 \u2212(1\u221212/6))))or ((6 -(1)*(6-2)),we get:(6*(6+2))/6\u21d212.Now add up every resultant figure like following \u2022\u2022\u2014||| |    ||----------||--------------------\u2192                       ^^^             //        ---      \\           \\\\---          //--------------//              ______________________\\\\\\__________/\\------_\\|\\===============\\===================///////         \\     \\\\            |\\               |\\\\\\|\r",
        "*12=2. Therefore only remaining unused portion (for this particular strip) = 12\u20132. Simiarly for other strips: Unused sections would be: Second: Subtracting 2/3*12 Millimeters which equals approximately ~8mm ; Third Strip:- Subtracting  1/2*12 mm , i.e., half or 6\u2009millimeters . Adding up these amounts together : Total amount non \u2013 Used section =====>(remaining parts)-[(First Glue Stick)+(Second Gluestick)+ThirdStick]=(10+~8+6)=24\u2009mm Hence Patrick still needs additional 24\u00a0 millimeters worth of adhesive bandages according to your requirements!

        " stick remaining unused. We use similar calculations again to find out about the other ones too! Here it goes\u2026.. For the next (second) glue stick which leaves us only having half or exactly 1/2 still available; when calculating such fractional parts off whole numbers, you take the multiplier down into fractions as well \u2013 meaning multiply both numerator & denominator respectively across the decimal value(s). Doing so transforms 'half', i.e.,  1 over 2 , thus making our multiplication simpler hence resultingantly clearer during conversions involved hereonwards... Henceforth calculate : `2`x `(1 / 2)`=**one half** => equal **six (=1\u00d76)=3 centimeter remains intact`. Concluding point wise rundown below represents every respective summative breakdown along pertainable lines namely:- Total Partially Available Glue Stick Measurements Are Given Below As Seen Upon Consultation From Source Text Which State:::`<|begin_part_of_answer|>`{'Used Length': {'First Bagel': [(6+2)/12],\r",
        " it since only half is unused. We know that (1/2)*(12) = 6 so, our difference comes out to 12 - 6 = 6. And finally for the last glue stick whose amount remaining uses up exactly 1/2 of its original value; hence also resulting into having another 6 millimeters worth completely non useable substance within those bars which leaves us thus adding 6 again to come upon a full summed result as such 10+6+6= Total Value Not Used equals 22 mm or centimeter units.
