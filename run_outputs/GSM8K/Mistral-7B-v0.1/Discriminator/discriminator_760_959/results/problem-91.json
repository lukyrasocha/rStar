To find out what this amounts to per shoe purchase (since we know he purchases twice a month), let\u2019s convert the annual cost into a monthly basis first before breaking it down further. First divide total annual expenditure ($2640) by twelve months equals $220 spent on shoes each month as follows: 2640 divided by 12 equals 220. Next since James buys two shoes each month; multiply monthly costs ($220) times six because one set consists of paired items equaling ten sets which translates to ten pairs in half a calendar year so calculate like such multiplying sixty weeks or time periods(two orders/month X twenty-six eight week span)=fifty six order intervals=twice a month over the whole year=(6x twentieth payment). Hence our value becomes fifty four ((sixtioth hour interval)(thirty sixth price)). Therefore using thirty Six pricetags($220 split evenly amongst them through multiplication):multiplied((price tag dividing three hundred twenty zero))equals$ 66. ",

        " to our calculation, it costs James $2,640 per year which equals about $16.8x (where 'x' represents time). Since we know this expenditure occurs over the course of twelve months or years ($1/month$), let's solve for '$x'. To find out what amounts to approximately \"$1\" worth of goods within those parameters set forth, divide $2,640/$16.8=approx.$158$. Hence every shoe sold approximatively cost him $.158 ~ $0.16 when rounded up due currency standardization rules.

Since there are 12 months in a single calendar year , divide the overall cost paid ($2640) by ten as we know James purchases only twenty four items during this timeframe(sixteen times six equals ninety six). As such; $2640/ 12= $220 . Divide again since twelve was used earlier but twice instead of once here because it takes half those purchased over eleven transactions so fifteen paired sets equalling thirty individual instances therefore forty eight divided evenly results roughly within three amounts when rounded upwards bringing our conclusion or unit price down toward around $3. Therefore , Each pair averages out to about $$\\approx$3. The answer is: 3. ",

That means if you divide this annual expense evenly over the entire twelve months, it represents his average monthly budget allocated towards these sneakers ($2,640 / 12), resulting in approximately $220 per month or roughly about sixteen sixty cents less than twice their normal price point ($220 ~= $2*2x) because most retailers tend not discount products sold together as 'buy one get another'.
