This leaves him with ~32 remaining vehicles(i.e., half gone). Further identify who gets those discarded automobiles; this individual receives double the quantity previously divested so around sixteen additional motorized transportation units get moved along unrecognised channels towards their maternal figure henceforth making it apparent Joe possesses ~16cars following said proceedings.(~32-(8*2)). To summarise therefore based upon mathematical calculation concerning vehicular possession distribution amongst individuals whilst factoring inherent familial relations among such entities yields us finding Jesse retains roughly fifteen mechanical contraptions post completion associated transactional activities inclusive but not limited to barter or exchange modalities within kinship structures thus arriving conclusively through analytic synthesis yield derived quantitative resultant vector representation i.e.\"",

Kisses & Smiles From Me Xx~~ OST ~~~~~ ALWAYS SMILEXDxxxxxxxxx PPTPPTPTTS..... :-P FUNNN NOWWGGGXX DDD TTTYYYU UUEEEE GGAHH MMMMBAAAAASS STARZ   xxddppptttssmileyoooofXXXXNice work dear @",
