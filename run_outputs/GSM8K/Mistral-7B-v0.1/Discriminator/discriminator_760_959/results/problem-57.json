And because no exact specifications mentioned other kinds apart plain sugar icing applied afterwards hereafter implied would likely entail another batch making them possibly available again when purchased later \u2013 though unlikely considering cost factor alone !

Hence Paul still requires twenty one (that being obtained through division because fourteen divided into seven unequally distributes exactly three cups per group while leaving us twelve unassigned.)
