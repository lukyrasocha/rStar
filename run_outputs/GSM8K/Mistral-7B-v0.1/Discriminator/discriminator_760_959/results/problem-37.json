Hence add both totals together we obtain; 300(seconds taken up by 'Deck the halls') plus 240('Jingle bells'), resulting in total=540 seconds altogether spent singing all songs during their session. To put this into minutes, simply divide by 60 because there are sixty seconds in every minute revealing them spending approximately eighty four point zero eight three or about 84 secondes minuets performing these melodies collectively based on our mathematical deduction presented above .

Therefore, the exact amount might differ based upon specific circumstances such as performance length limits set beforehand and pauses etc., but theoretically speaking their carol could take about 13 mins per complete playthrough cycle i.e performing \u201cDeck the halls\u201d and Jingle bells respectively twice each back to back continuously during their scheduled event period considering no intermissions included within playing times.
