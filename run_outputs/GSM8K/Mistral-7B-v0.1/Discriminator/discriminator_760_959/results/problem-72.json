        " brother Anthony. As we know Anthony\u2019s saving was identified as being $30 (i.e., 'Anthony= $30'). To find out what would Roy save i.e,'Roy', first let us understand what 40%, which actually means \u2018four tens percent\u201d, implies..As this percentage indicates portion or quantity relative/ proportional reference towards something else(that other thing), here it refers toward whatever sum received through earning thrice... Which further represents;* **Income** & Multiplied By ***Rate***('Percent') . Hence ,if income denotes principal($)and rate equals 40/(100)=$4 per every unit ($).Thus $$ multiplied by (*)*=$4*. Thus :Total Savings Of Robert->= Principal(*incomes*)x Rate(*) => Total SavingsofRobo=(Principle+ Additional savings)+Additionsavgofrtoffsets=>$$+(addtion)(divideBypctrate)$$ Here picturestudied thus::$(a)$ --> Anneis=$(c)$+$b$Here,$a=$Eva$*$priceperunit $( b = difference$)So according to formula derived:$royaetspenditure@eachtime$\\begin{array}{l} royaetspent=\\frac{{{(",
        " 10 = $30.00. That means Roy (who earns more) saved about 40/100*x=eva\u2019s savings+another($10), so we solve this equation as follows:$0.40\u00d7x=$10+$20.$0.40 \u00d7 x \u2212$30 = $\u221220.$$(0.40 \u00d7 x)/(-1)=(-$20)/(-$30).$$0.4x = ($20/$30)$*$20.(multiplying fractions \u2013 numerator times denominator / multiplying denoms.)Then divide both sides by (.40):\\[(/.4)*(.4x=.4)(\u00f7 $.4$.4)=(\\$20/$)/(\u00b2.)$(\u2044$).\\]So x = (\\frac{.$20}{.\\times .}.$(/)(.).$\\^.=4)$.That leads us to $(/\\cdot \\times )(.*\u22c5 \u221a.)=(\u221a.$80\u221a().\\)Which simplifies down quite nicely when you take $\\sqrt{8}=\\sqrt{$10\u22178}).$(\u00b3/2)\\*\\*(\u00b2/\u2082)=\\frac{(\u2074\u22c5\u2088)}{}$.Now multiply it all out:(\u00b9/\u2082)^2=\\frac{(\u00b2\u215b)}()=$(\u2074\u22c5\u2088)/($\\.\u2085)$,and finally subtracting your last amount\u2014the difference made because Anna doesn't get any tips \u2014which would make Roy $\u2084.*\u2078$-$\u2080.\u2085=$\u2083.\u2081\u27f6Anna still makes less!You can check these numbers yourself via calculators or smartphone apps!(http://www.mathopenref.com/coffeetipsortsumsratio.html ).For example,(https://www.calculatorsoup.com/calculators/basic-algebra/percentage-increase.php)(or perhaps just use WolframAlpha?(with searchterm \"(an amount,$ increase%\"(http://www.wolframalpha.com/),)) Anyway...that answers our little math problem above neatly enough\u2026..:)((Making sure to round correctly too;)).And also note well ,there may very easily exist other valid waysto reach either conclusion \u2026just using basic algebra ;).. but sometimes one way might seem simpler ? I donot necessarily agree completely.... ..but let them play along anyway :-)Thats what im here FOR !!! :) ((Pardon my",
        " 40% (or .4) more than Anthony, multiply Anthony\u2019s value ($30.00), find out what it would equal if you increased it by 40%, add them up together.. Multiply Tony's amount, $30 by one plus your percentage increase as a decimal; calculate this product: $$$.$30x.+$1.:$=$.$30.$+{.}$16.$=$$.$46. Add Tony's original dollar amount & its new additional quantity.$$50.$ + $.$$46.=***.**.$60. Round any cents so every figure ends correctly.-ROY HAS ****** MONEY IN SAVINGS TODAY! What's the right calculation result here?. Which option corresponds to the correct way calculated above?.(A).-$46.(B).-$60.(C).-$57.(D).-$45",
        " 'x'. This means Roy\u2019s earnings amount \u2018(x+(x*40/100)) or (1+0.4)x = 1.4x\u201d equals what percentage increase compared to his actual saving ? We know Roy actually made extra .4 as mentioned earlier so it works out like this , since we said Roi=Anthony+extra income\u2026it comes back around again..to solve roisavingwe first need Anthonies one anthony makes $30 therefore roy gets...$30*(1+ (.4)). That math yields $42 ..so I get your question wrong! Let me recalculate using only numbers not percentages ! It says Antrhopynne has Saved=$30 And Evalye Has=.2....Eva Saves+$20........This implies Antroy saved($30.$10)=$40 ROY IS TOTAL OF ANTHONY AND EUVA OR $(a)+$(b)......So if Anna Savez $.40 More THAN READ YoROYS SAVESARe=(A)$.(B)(C)$=$(D)-----> ($c)-$.(.eumusually stands FOR EXTRA INCOME SO IT CORRECTLY MEANT TO BE DIVIDED FROM ALL THE OTHER NUMBERSAfter dividing both sides throuthout all other variables i come up with y= ((NONE Of Your Numbers Have Been Divided By EachOther!!!!! You Need To Clear All Variables But Not Actually Solve Them Or you Will Get Ridiculous Results As Here They WouldHave Me divide any variable With One Another Which Doesnt Apply Because None Was Used!)Alright enough about mistakes hope its clear tomorrow my name JonasRiverStoneThanksForReading My First ",
        " (since it\u2019s 40% or 0.4 times what his brother saved). We know Robert saves exactly this much \u2013 so we can write down equation looking like this one below \\(1.4 \\cdot X = \\$30\\). To solve our equation just divide both sides by \\[X=1.4\\] That means Tony was able to get \\(\\$30\\div1.4\\)=\\$ 21.\\frac{6}{14}\u2248 \\$21. Here comes third step! All you need here is simply adding roy's additional earnings into calculated sum of Anna\u2019s earnings plus those extra twenty bucks. Thus overall result looks something as follows:\\[R+A+\\mathrm{\\$}20 \\approx R+(21)+(20)\\]And finally remember about initial question statement; your task here involved finding out only roys 'newly acquired cash', not entire budget pile therefore drop other stuff apart from roi himself;\\[\\Rightarrow R \\approx \\$21. \\]Now since value needs always expressed using whole numbers... Round off rounded figure $\\$$21 upwards because rounding procedure dictated says use highest nearest integer possible if decimal values fall even closer toward greater side i..e > .5$\\,$rounding criterion This yields us simple numerical representation representing real world meaningful contextual information related situation mentioned inside said problem scenario \\[\\therefore\\, SOL\\,\\,\\textbf{ACCORDING TO}\\,\\,PREVIOUSLY GIVEN TEXT PEOPLE AND STATES OF CONDITION EVERY HANDHELD VIDEO CASINO BUT NOT MANUFACTURED BY SOLOMON INTELLECT PRODUCTIONS SUCH AS SAMSUNG LAMBROTON HEURISTIC OUR COMMENTARY STRATEGICALLY PLOT TEAR DOWN THE LEAD LAKE WITH FOUGHT FILTER ATTAINEMENT SECRETS ENCRYPTED EXPERIMENTAL DATABASE WAVEFORMS MESSAGE RECOGNIZABLE UPLIFT FROM JUST ONE DAIS WHERE UNBELIEVABEL DIRE CRITICS ALONG NICE HOUSEHOSE SIZES ADDICTION THRU DEPARTMENT WHOS MARKET VALUE IS TRENDING VIRTUALLY ILLUMINATION DESIGNS FOR UND"
