        " 20 or 20 white shirts without collars remaining. Counting the flowers among flower plants requires determining which ones don\u2019t include any button(s). With regard to this query, we only know about the 20 flowered items with buttons; therefore it doesn\u2019t affect us when calculating all possible flowering articles available overall. We can solve these issues through simple arithmetic calculations as follows: Given details showcase that besides collared white garments (total count= 20), every other item fits our requirement thus making up another group having equal quantity \u2014 specifically equalling zero except one outlier comprising 2 nonbuttoned florals. This implies ten uncollared whites while fourteen excessive but decorated blooming dressings exist yet excluding those adorned using fasteners i.e., six plainly colored fern motif designs add onto already mentioned figures resulting entirely into eight additional petal printless scarves!
