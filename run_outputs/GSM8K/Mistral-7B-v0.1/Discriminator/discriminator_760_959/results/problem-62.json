As you can see above our computation results come together nicely without having too break anything apart before putting everything back again since nothing gets broken while doing computations but rather combined naturally forming new relationships among variables along its way thus showing clear understanding towards solving problems mathematically correctly ;) Therefore ,for clarity sake let us add something extra : calculate using division first followed by further addition later upon getting required sum ; basically use parentheses around numerators inside braces [] only divide outside brackets .
