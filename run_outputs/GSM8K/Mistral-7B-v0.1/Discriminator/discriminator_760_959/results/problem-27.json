Subtract those sums from the total figure \u2013 so subtracting together what we know about smart tv\u2019s & analogs; it results into 40-(10+5), equalling fourteen units . These forty minus fifteen means samell sells only seventeen oled televisions over twenty weeks time frame thus making your result as 14 or you can say if three hundred forty television sets get purchased during said span no more than six tens may not buy olde style screens meaning ten percent thirty eight plus twelve fifty seven point etc..
