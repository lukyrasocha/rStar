To find out if one employee works longer or slower (and therefore making less), we need to compare the results obtained above. Billy earned $(10) \u00d7 (20). That equals $200. Sally would make $(\\$10+\\$\\frac{1}{2})\u00d7(20)=(\\$10\\times20)+($\\frac{1}{2}\\times20)=$200+$\\frac{1}{2} \\times20=200+10=\\$210$. To calculate which worker made more/less over this period subtract $\\$$x_B\u200b -\\$$y_A $$ as you wish since it makes no difference mathematically whether B >/< A\u00a0or \u00a0A\u200a\u2265 B \u2192 y \u2212 b  \u2208 {negative\u2009number,zero,positive}, here , Y ($210)-X ($200) ${\u2212}$$10$, thus Billy earned &lsquo;`${\u2009-}\u202f\u00ad$10&rsquo;&lt;$null$; hence, he earns `$10 fewer $.`'",
        " the hours worked. Billy earned (10) ($10/hour)(20hours)=$200. Sally earned(10.5$)($10/hour)(20hours=210). Subtracting their respective totals we get $$210-$200$$ which equals $$10$. When working similar tasks under same circumstances ,they usually pay higher wages when someone starts as compared to later periods but not equal .

This indicates Bobby earned 1 dollar less as opposed to being better off based upon our comparison calculation.
