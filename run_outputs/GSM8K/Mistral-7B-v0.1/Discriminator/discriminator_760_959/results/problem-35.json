Based on such rules applied above let\u2019s begin setting up proper formulas accordingly below shown steps :- Step ",
        " To find out what percentage represents when something decreases we can subtract it away (in this case you would decrease the whole which means all). Subtracting the percent taken makes up your remainder or leftover amount . We start by figuring out our discount multiplier :   Decrease % / 100    Discount Multiplier=       Original Price      Less Decrease Amount     Equals Final Selling Price         Since I want my value as a decimal instead just move the decimal point twice so divide both sides above by 100..Original Price------Decease Percent-----Final Value-------x-------------------Decrease--Percent--------Displacement------------Multiplication----------Division----y=-1(or)multiplyBy(-1)=                            y=$40/-(%.25*($40))/$1=.
