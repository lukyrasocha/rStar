Substituting these values into the formula , we obtain $3/Mile X 10mpg or 'Cost Per Mile', which amounts up to $3/(10 mpgs)=$0.30/$per mile !

Consequently, since mileage covered totals out to 150 divide them among themselves using up 1 unit Gallon every time covers these distances therefore equating our calculation process via basic division formula yields: Fuel consumed during the coursework = Miles travelled / Efficiency thereby implying that 150/(MPG)=Fuel consumption or alternatively dividing said equation through standard normalization provides us with Cost of transportation=$(150)/Efficiency times Price per Unit $(3)=$((150)*($3))/$=(rounded off value) resulting to approximately USD4.5k , concluding henceforth upon deducing that indeed my computation affirms true alignment towards fulfillment within parameters stipulated accordingly .
