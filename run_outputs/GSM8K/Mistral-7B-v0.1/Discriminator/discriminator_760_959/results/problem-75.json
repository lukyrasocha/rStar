        " the highway, we can say their combined rate (or collective pace) per hour would be dividing distance traveled which is 'd', i.e., `Distance(kangaroos)/Time= Speed/hours`, therefore; `Speed_total = Distance / Time_all` , implies `(speed of one kangaroo * Number of Kangaroos)` `/ Total Hours`. Rearranging terms leads us to find \u2018Speed_Kangaroo\u2019 as follows :`Dividend = Divisor \u00d7 Quotient ; Therefore -> Dividend = divisor*quotient => [distance/(numberofkangaroos)]=[time\u00d7SpeedPerOne]=HourlyRateForEach.` Hence let's assume if \u201cX\u201d kilo meters was crossed by three kangaroos together within \u201cY\u201d hours (`XY kilometers covered`), our equation becomes `[Xkm]/[Yhrs] = [Tx km}/[(Z hrs) XnoOfKangaroons]`. Simplifying yields `NoOfKangaroos ~ Tz*NoOfSpeeds`, implying you only need to divide your first No Of animals or object into second set like no less than equal speeds hence getting new calculated value for different animal population size but maintain original duration(`new hrss == oldhrs`). Thus rephrasing this information above such that;`New Population Size = Oldpopulationsize*(DividedBy)*OriginalDuration`;we get:`Four Turtle Spidies~ Three Lizard Speeds*.

We can say since every single cycle requires \u2018one hour\u2019 when these go together this means going individually would still require just \u201cone\u201d trip regardless whether you use multiple units doing them collectively. Thus finding what needs calculating becomes easier because instead having complicated calculations involving averages etc., simply consider basic arithmetic principles about proportional relationships among numbers\u2014i..e.: What fractional part corresponds directly back onto itself through division operations alone without requiring anything else being multiplied into play except possibly small constants like pi (which don\u00b4t apply here anyway).

We find therefore that when individually these units cover whatever length L ;it requires only those:`L/(3*k)`=time required;where the unit being used here represents either group i.e. any single animal can be replaced equally among others because no matter what order things occur in during our timeline;for example replacement would not cause change--a direct effect caused directly outside ourselves.`Then since both groups differ due difference_in_(speed);here represented simply via numbers such as doubling speeds results halving times needed etc.;thus applying ratio rules thusly allows resolution back onto previous conclusion.*Three distinct factors influence overall completion process --threefold variables representing various levels involved within larger system (`Speed`:fractional value assigned against baselines established earlier based off observations made),(individual contributions)`,(`Time`),etc..*(all expressed quantifiably.)**Subsequently utilising knowledge gained through above calculation provides insight regarding next part---specific details concerning specific subject under discussion.--hence why numerical representation offers maximum efficiency compared linear narrative explanation.(Different approaches yield similar outcomes despite varying complexity level employed.).

Next segment; considering halved velocity reduces journey efficiency thus quadruples its previous needed duration due to having only quarter/third of original strength ('turtle force'), calculate revised timeline requires multiplication operation \u2014 hence ,four times older duration than already determined kangaroo figure brings us up onto about  144 hrrs(~approx). Therefore,\"After accounting changes such as slower overall movement inherent within respective species attributes whilst ensuring uniform methodology & comparable metrics\" our conclusion emerges : Four Turtles taking roughly around approximately 144 Hours if you allow yourself leeway during calculation approximations while still providing useful guidance toward correct understanding without overshooting actual calculations based entirely on presented parameters.\"",
