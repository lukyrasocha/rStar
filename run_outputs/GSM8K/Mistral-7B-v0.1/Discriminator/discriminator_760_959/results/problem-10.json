I see though why this would make sense intuitively; if fragrance companies only want successful ones according to profitability indicators like popularity amongst customers who buy them first time rather than later reorders/recommendations etc., then those products which people seem less attracted towards right away but become very profitable months down line could actually deserve attention since overall lifetime value may exceed average monthly returns generated purely through initial success rates alone without considering longer term prospectivity potential .

Let V represent Vanilla and Fruit represents Fragrance (fruits). Therefore; Total fragrances sold per category can be calculated using simple arithmetic sequence formula since it was mentioned 'they sold 5 of each'. Thus making n=5 , hence applying the Arithmetic Series Formula --> S_n/2 [2*a+(n-1)d] ; therefore when applied here makes [(5)/2][(2*(5))+((5)-1)*(-1)] i.e [(5/2)[10-(5-1)(1))] -- >[(5/2){10-4]}--->[5*{6}]-->{30}. This implies ten instances occurred outrightly without any regard whether said instance belongs specifically to either fraction or not but rather all cases indifferently .
