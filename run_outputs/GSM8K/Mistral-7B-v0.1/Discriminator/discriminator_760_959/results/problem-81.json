Therefore the reply stands as ,$5600$.

Totaling all amounts available thus makes $(5000+200)=$5200. To identify remaining funds subtraction operation can easily solve itself \u2013 subtract total expenses($10800)from savings & extra income(Total=5200), therefore getting us negative values (-$5600). This implies insufficiency rather than surplus; hence concluding that regardless of other supports received beforehand such additional fund shortfall would necessitate either reduction in desired purchases/expenditures or increased revenue generation methods until adequate resources build up over time leading back towards financial equilibrium within target spending bracket set previously.

From here subtract the amount of money Gordon currently possesses which you calculated earlier as being having $5200; this operation leaves us with $10800 \u2013 $5200 resulting into $5600. Therefore, Daniel needs another $5600. ",

That amounts to cost_total= $10000+ $800= $10800.$ Since we know Cost=$10800$ , Amount needed $=Cost \u2013 Available$ .
