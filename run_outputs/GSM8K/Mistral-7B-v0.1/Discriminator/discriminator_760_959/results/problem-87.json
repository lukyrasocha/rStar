Therefore, over a period of just 'one year,' Brenda could expect growth due solely to earned interest equaling roughly (.33)*($300) which equals around $99.. Hence following linearity through successive periods without any additional input, you might conclude about compounding effect but we don't need it so far since only annual addition being asked... Let us add up these individual amounts sequentially; i.e.: First Year Growth= Initial Amount+ Annual Interest=(Initial/Ratio Value)+(Interest Rate)/Time)=$((300/.33))+(300*.33)/1=$99+$99=$198 Second And Third Years would also earn similar sums hence Total Returns At Three Period End Sum Up To : ((First Year*Number Of Extended Times Beyond One )+Total Principal Return From Original Deposit)=\\[(198*(3-1)]+\\[300\\]= \\$694 ",

But since these kinda 'deposits', don;t add up but keep growing ,it means their compound . With formula above its gonna look like this  ; N=A_final=(principal)(r)^year .. I believe your question wants me using plain math here instead...so..we use just multiplication :)   Total $$ spent over time equals initial plus multiplied times principal & rates repeatedly ...this case being quarterly....and not annually ;)   Alas ! We simply say let our principal P=$300 r=[three quarters]/[one] which gets us [five fourth / four]. And lets call n=number units repeated or TIME periods elapsed ->which makes yrs->{y}. Hence what we want totals become ((Five Fourth)/four )\\*$p^T+$p $(investments)$ wanna know only new ones without starting deposit returned ....not even counting those when calculating annualised rate either :(    Thus simplifying becomes -->$\\frac {5} {4}$ \\*\\* Y + $\\frac {$300}{Y}$-**($P$)------the minus shows no needing p because im focusing solely ON NEW MONEY WE GET RELATIVE TO INITIAL NOT ORIGINAL STORED CASH!!\r",
