This means subtracting those activities\u2019 times from totals so far; i.e., Reading takes up half of available time minus one hour leaving us with only ten free units or six point three eight seven minutes per unit because every minute equals one twelfth since this needs division into twelve parts as mentioned before regarding the distribution among Soccer, Video Games & other stuff based upon their proportions. That leaves four sevenths (which simplifies down further) plus approximately eleven sixthteenths...so round about forty percent would mean roughly twenty points when converting our decimal back again while keeping ratio rules intact during conversion process thus answering question correctly here!

To express these six hours out of twelve possible options shows us how proportionate or relative our values really are. Hence if you want your numbers expressed in percents just divide them into ten parts; therefore here half equals one part divided further twice which means 2*2 % resulting equal to forty percent. Thus , when translating all known variables concerning leisure pursuits within stated context framework onto appropriate numerical scales linked specifically towards calculating ratio relationships .

Consequently, she spends \\[ \\frac{4}{5} \\] or 4 out of every 5 possible non-playing intervals playing soccer since none of her free times besides those spent on videos or books was allocated elsewhere. To find the proportion as a whole during one period (either Saturday or Sunday), we consider only half of Sundays available due to equal distribution across two periods resulting in \\[\\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right) \\times \\frac{1}{2} = [eval((4/5)*(1/2))=0.4]\\] 0.4 representing all other uses such as sleep, meals etc., not played sports like soccer.

Therefore, Tatiana spends \\(1/7=0.14\\overline{2}\\) or about  14%of her available spare time on sport activity.

Finally subtracting all activities against initial sum yields 'remaining'. Calculate proportion as follows ((total_hours)-(video_games+reading))/(total_hours)\u00d7100%. Plugging values into formula results: Proportion spent playing soccer `(Total Time Spent Playing Soccer)/(Initial Total Weekend Hours)*100%`=`((7+5) \u2013 (1+(5/3\u20133))) / (7+5) * 100%=((12-(1*-27)) / 12 )* 100%=109%, but since percentages cannot exceed 100%, thus Tatiana doesn\u2019t play any official football during her whole rest period.` ",

Hours dedicated to soccer equals available hours minus times devoted elsewhere i.e., readings and video gaming ,or rather we subtract these three activities combined duration from overall free time : thus ,  12-(3+(4/3)) =~ 7. To get the percentile value against allotted playtime via division operation (=percentage): therefore ,   7/(Total Available Time)-((Available Time Dedicated Elsewhere)/(Whole or Total Possible Playing Might Be)). This translates into calculating ratio [(Availability Minus Allocation Percentage)] divided by [Comprehensive potential allocation] . Solving out this proportional expression provides %value as pertains solely applicable towards Socratic activity ; Hence obtainable output results within range {0<result <=1}.

To find out how this fraction compares as percentages we take advantage of multiplying fractions times their denominators (in our case 3) first before finding equivalent ratios such that we can get rid of any remainders thus making it simpler like converting them into quarters because everything else except piano was divided equally throughout these free periods so far; namely playtime sessions consisted entirely among activities but none exclusive enough when comparing all types shared together .

Thus, %[Math(x)]{(.0833)(|)}\u2248%. This value rounded off translates into about %.
