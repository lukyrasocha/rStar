        " Calculate the total expense by multiplying the quantity (in pounds) times its price per pound. Cost equation can hence get formulated as follows: Total spending on fruits = ($2/lb \u00d7 6 lb )+$1/lb \u00d7 8 lb+($3/lb \u00d7 6 lb). Thus total would calculate up like this: Total Spending=[$12] + [$8]+[ $18 ]=>Total=$38 thus Winston spent $$38 buying these amounts of different types or kinds of fresh produce! Therefore The ",
