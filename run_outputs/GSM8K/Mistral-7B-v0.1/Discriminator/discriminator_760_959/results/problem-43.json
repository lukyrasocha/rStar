Since we know it was mentioned twice because this scenario happened separately but cumulatively equals up to 3.5+3.5=7 hours; therefore, subtract those times from the required accumulated sum which equates into 30(hours)-7(hours)=23 hours yet remains unplayed. Hence you deduce if Kris wants to acquire all related rewards within no less than 7 remaining workdays under equivalent conditions i.e., spending equal amounts daily, divide the leftover count evenly across them using division operation, yielding precisely about 3.29 hours~per-day round off or approximately four minutes ~extra beyond one working period assuming standardized six o\u2019clock closing cutoff point schedule without extending operating margin past closure boundary constraints provided thus far.
