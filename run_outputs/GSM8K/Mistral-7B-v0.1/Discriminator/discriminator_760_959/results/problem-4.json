Calculate this expression using addition since these prices belong together because it refers to all purchases made; herein lies our sum variable `total`. We add up costs as follows  2(3) + 1(5)+ 3(1) which results in calculating individual expenditures first and adding everything later so `(2)(3)` equals `$6`,`+ (1)(5)`equals$5and finally plus `(3)(1)=$$3$.

Here, \"$1\" represents 'tomato', '$2' stands for 'cucumber' & lastly '$3'; refers explicitly towards 'head of leafy green known commonly referred too but generally terming under broader categories such assalads greens'.

It doesn't matter which price you choose here as long as it results in same amount or less because these people could split the items anyway (for example if jack wanted all tomatos). Finally since this question was not clear enough what exactly kinda relationship/connection exists among buyers I guess simply subtracting their purchases individually amounts would result too confusing so just summing prices up seems logical approach :| . Okay looking closer into mentioned problem statement above says 'Together', therefore suggesting combination action performed together may count towards single expense transaction even though individual spending account records exist but still combining makes most sense :) ;-)   Total payment value =>(sum part one itemlist)+(substract secondpartitemcount*(individualprice))+thirdpartytotalspend=leilachistomarshchatcase_example===> ((firstpersonitems*seperatetotalexpensemultiplier) +secondtotaltotalexponentiate+(thirdfriendisalsonameamount)=finalresult )where; first person name=\"leila\"; second:\"jack\"; third\":\"chase\"..within parentheses -> add both totals=(multipliedexpenses)>>(lastaddedexponent)->addothertotal->finishingpoint==\"thequestionanswervalue\":>>so basically considering your description without further details & assumptions below calculation shows true solution:$((LEIAL$PBMRCHQXNV%YW%%@)(DGHJLKPOUI^)\"cost per purchase\"/(@)*($)$([)]);which when converted back according our earlier discussed general equation looks like:::([$purchaseramtitleresponses]$)[/$]([\"pricelabel\"]\\[$\\])*(:{futureinteractions+$}())\\;\\;&nbsp;;\\\\$$(%):&lt;&gt;combinedoutput&amp;&gt;&epsilon;or better yet,(simply),(dollarvaluesofeachboutbuyer=$[\\textless|$]\\[[$_]_\\{\\,\\}$][/_]\\^{}_^{\\};),then:[$(grouptheseoneway$[]!=\\emptyset)&and=[($(length$~\"\\${(innerhair)}\")<{$outerbody})]/&&&\\subsetneq;&implies&(\\exist!(~$[])~\\vee~\\exists!\\similarobjects)$.whenconvertbacktoouroriginalgeneralformula using mathjax style notation follows $([(",

And this makes us come up with $(A)= P+(b)*Z$, here Z denote unit weight , or common factor like gram/oz etc ... It depends upon what exactly contextually holds relevance in our discussion... Our case only involves monies being exchanged during consumption process hence I went along directly till last equality.. Note! Common Unit not necessarily grams / oz but however whatever works best among different commodity weights based off quantities .. Likewise these terms might take various values depending which direction goes into your equation set either starting point towards purchasing firstly available consumable material until entire demand reaches zero state otherwise vice versa !
