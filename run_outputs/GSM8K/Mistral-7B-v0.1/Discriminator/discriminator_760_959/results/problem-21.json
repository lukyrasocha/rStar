        " pizzas which we know as part of this calculation; these account for another half (i.e., 2/x * Total Cost) but instead say their price individually, so solve for them first before moving onto finding out about others ($30): Since those 2 individual costs add up together to make one entire third (30 / X), you can divide three into sixteen equally because 64 divided evenly by itself equals twelve times its square root value or eighteen point eighty seven percent. This would imply however our target denominations need not equal nor exceed either hundredth place values thus limiting us here alone too low while still leaving quite possibly ample amounts per single unit thereby making sense logistically speaking regarding spending within reason without becoming completely careless financially regardless whether consumable goods such common staples may include bread loaves etcetera!

        " pizzas cost 30 dollars which totals to 60 dollars when combined (because it\u2019s unclear whether these refer to both together or individually). Subtract this value from the overall spending to find out what remains as the sum payable towards purchasing the remaining two identical priced items; therefore subtracting costs i.e., you get 64-(30+30)= 64-60= 4 dollars/pizza . Thus , every one of those equal price units sums up to precisely  4 Dollars! Because we want their individual prices divided among them equally so divide accordingly : Each equals exactly$ 2. This means irrespective over time all groups consumptions remain steady because nothing alters without causing variation amongst everyone else except perhaps occasional indulgences such fluctuation could result into changes not directly caused per se but rather indirect implications stemming due variations elsewhere within context specific dynamics hence allowing minor alterations while maintaining general trend continuity providing stability ensuring smooth flow thus making adjustments possible thereby eliminating discrepancies creating equilibrium establishing fairness fostering inclusiveness strengthening bonds nurturing healthy relationships forming solid groundwork promoting prosperous growth potentialities unlocking vast array capabilities further catalyzing progression forward accelerated development enhancing mutual benefits encouraging reciprocal cooperation amplifying collaborative effect facilitating productivity maximizing efficiency optimizing performance resulting collective success rewarding shared rewards building lasting legacies celebrating achievements inspiring future endeavors elevating spirits uplifting morale energizing enthusiasm fueling passion igniting creativity sparking innovation driving progress transforming obstacles into opportunities propelling human evolution advancing society culture shaping destiny defining horizons setting boundaries expanding possibilities exploring unknown territories embarking upon adventures discovering wonders encountering marvels experiencing miracles witnessing history unfolding destinies fulfilling dreams achieving goals realizing aspirations accomplishing objectives attaining victories conquering challenges surmounting hurdles reaching milestones crossing finish lines breaking records smashing ceilings climbing mountains scaling heights flying higher than ever before ascending heavenward venturing beyond stars journeying through galaxies navigating cosmic mysteries traversing intergalactic spaces roaming nebula clusters drifting amidst solar systems cruising past planets orbit"
