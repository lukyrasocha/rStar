At the start of lunch time (after those additional cars arrived), half the cars went meaning that only 70*1/2=<<70*1/2=35>>35 stayed remaining parked throughout lunchtime. Therefore the difference made which was taken away would mean 70-(the amount remained)=70-35= <<70-(70*1/2)=35>>35 vehicles leaving over the course or duration of lunchbreak so it means we can infer thanhese same as all others thus making them still remain hence answering me question!

        " he counts 70 (50 initial + 20) vehicles. Since half went away during lunchtime means you divide 70 / 2 which equals 35 remaining cars. Thus before counting this last time, it would mean  70 original count minus 35 leaving equaling as such; so initially we found another way stating subtraction starting off with twice value since halving only takes us back down to earlier state yet not reflect new arrival or subtractive process leading up hereafter.

Thus before any changes occurred as per your last statement about them leaving half away \u2013 there were still only 50 present. As such while you haven't stated what changed precisely between being able to confirm the original amount and determining exactly which halving took place , logic suggests that most likely prior actions meant subtracting numbers not yet mentioned but necessary ones included : i)   the same addition performed earlier; ii) & possibly also considering further events unnoticed here involving possible car departures or arrival post initial counting if needed . But without explicit detail regarding timeline specificity / action causality relationship among occurrences over time intervals indicated sequentially through narration structure employed etc beyond simply mentioning increases followed immediately afterwards reduced quantities yield inference implications pointing back again towards needing subtraction instead adding directly off provided start values themselves due inherent contextual emphasis focusing solely onto net change effect rather direct account balance impact overall despite latter part\u2019s description seemingly attempting alternate method interpretive approach perhaps confusing audience readers unless clarified specifically otherwise clearly understood expected intended analytical pathways adherence following normatively accepted conventional problem solving conventions applied universally applicable across diverse situations regardless individual circumstantial variation adaptations requiring flexibility tailored appropriate responses according respective unique challenges encountered faced necessitating differentiated assessment adjustments respond aptively fitting situational needs accordingly achieving desired satisfactory resolution satisfying objective goal attainment thereby preventing potential discrepancies arising causing undue difficulty hampering achievement progress resulting unnecessary complications delaying success outcome potentially hindering future endeavors negatively affecting prospect perspectives stance hence making clear explanation essential ensuring comprehensive understanding facilitated effective decision making process integral promoting favorable progression trends conducive beneficial influence positively enhancing long term results desirability thus explaining why presented example serves illustrative educational purpose aimed ultimately teaching lessons learnt valuable insights derived insightful experience gained helping us apply similar strategies repeatedly successfully avoid pitfalls previously overcome facing similarly tricky obstacles moving forward improving our abilities handling various scenarios effectively utilizing knowledge learned accumulated wisdom earned applying acquired skills practicing honed techniques mastering craft proficient manner perfecting precise processes refining execution style streamlining efficiency boosting productivity output quality",

        " 70 cars since 20 new ones arrived. Half as many went away means half remained which we calculate using multiplicative inverse so it becomes (1 / .5) or simply multiply by 2 instead , thus having only double fewer remaining i.e., divide by 2 making them go down to  70/.5=35 vehicles still present. Hence, Hunter counts this as three times less than what came initially meaning no vehicle was actually seen leaving but rather doubling up hence zero countable occurrences. Final ",
