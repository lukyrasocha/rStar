It's important not just to remember which types of flowers she keeps but also their original quantity before removing any due to either loss or natural conditions as specified in the problem statement. When I calculate this up...it comes out wrong.\r\rFor example,\rHere would look like my approach if i didn\u2019t consider excluding losses/natural events while adding totals.: \r(x)((y+z)/i)=A; Total Number of Petals Exposed;\rwhere :    y=Number Flowers Pick initially     z=Petals per flower Initial Quantity Picked   X=(Initial Quantities Lost)\r\rIn short..you multiply ((NumberFlowers)*(petalQuantity))to get the initial amount exposed ,and THEN divide ALL THAT BY NOW EVERYTHING INTEGRATED CORRECTLY EXCLUDED YOUR ERROR WITH MULTIPLICATION! :) To clarify, let's break down the calculation into steps based on the information provided about the different groups of flowers and taking into account the ones Rose dropped along the way. Here's the detailed solution following your instructions: First group consists of 3 roses with 5 petals each => \\(3 \\times 5 = 15\\) petals. Second group has 4 daisies with 6 petals each => \\(4 \\times 6 = 24\\) petals. Third group contains 5 sunflowers with 4 petals each => \\(5 \\times 4 = 20\\) petals. Fourth group includes 6 irises with 7 petals each => \\(6 \\times 7 = 42\\) petals. Adding these together gets us a subtotal without considering anything being dropped: \\(15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101\\) petals. Since Rosen dropped 1 rose, 1 daisy, 1 sunflower, and 1 iris respectively, reducing our count accordingly results in removal of \\(1 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 18\\) petals since each category contributes its entire set value minus one dropout scenario. Finally, deduct the removed petals (\\(18\\)) from the overall sum obtained previously (\\(101",
        " of (3*5) + (4*6) + (5*4) + (6*7) = 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals before anything happened. Since she dropped one flower of each kind, we need to subtract 1 petal per type. This results in (15-1)+(24-1)+(20-1)+(42-1)= 14+23+19+41= 97. Therefore, Roses Vase contains only 97 Petals as this was all the ones she successfully put together.
