Each kill yields 10 points, thus making her point accumulation (for enemies) equivalent to 10*(E+8). Similarly, since Berries collected also contributed towards overall score, this adds further dimension as we assume both players collect same amount which would equate it not impacting relative scores. Finally considering time factor being negative implies penalty here & its magnitude i.e., bigger delay means greater decrease in points scored during said period; implying having lesser or equal counterpart can result favorable scoring condition even if others manage higher quantity yield per unit interval thereby increasing disparity resulting larger delta value representing performance differential/difference wrt opponent under identical resource accessibility constraints irrespective individual merit metrics etc..

Since Berrys cost both players 3BavgBerries per player , then scoring S=(B+3)\u22c510+(8)+((T/2)\u00d730 )and similarily getting Score (ES)-Score (EB)= S-(Esore).

Additionally, if Ava collected three more berries (let\u2019s say B) it means she would get additional 3*5=15 points over Emma due to these extra treats which adds up as another point gain advantage relative to Emmenetric time. But this doesn't affect any calculation related to scoring based upon performance times, though we consider its effect here because otherwise, without information about actual count of Berries both player can gather or Time taken by them , We won't able to establish comparision factor exactly .Now let us assess situation accordingly assuming Both players took X minutes till completion(which actually varies during practice session while attempting ) since exact timings weren\u2019t provided within problem context : This implies remaining Game Timer was ((X Minutes/Y Seconds))*(Difference Of Their Completion Times)=((X mins / Y s)*4 sec).But Since It Is Same As Initial State Only Different Player Finish With MoreSeconds Remaining Which Provides Additional Score According To Problem Contextual Statement Given.(i.e Even Though Delays Are Equal Each Players Would Have Gained Onerous Points From Those Extra Sec)(ii.)This Will Be Multiplied By Threshold Value i.e., Timing Conversion Parameter Or Unit Rate Here=(Based Upon Information Available)/ Total Possible Units Performed Within Set Period(Also Called BasisUnit),In Present Case,(Game Clock Running When All Enemies & Treasures Defeated),(So Setting Ground Zero At Fewest Necessary Parameters Assuming Base Metric Accrodign ExamplesLike \u2018Time Taken per Level'(To Evaluate Overhead Expended During Execution)),Here;Assuming One Particular Standard Common RuleFor Usages Like Video GamesPlaytimePerLevelIsUsedAsBasisMetricFollowing Conditions Must Apply:(a)We Should Ignore Fact That Last Four Seconds Were Not UsedWhen Computation Beginning Stage And Thus Don't Need Considerable Amountof CalculationsAt EndStageAlthough Actuals Values May Result SimilarOutcomesGivenCalculationalProcess Was ReducedByEfficiencyImprovementsAndPlayerSpeedAdjustmentsWhichWouldLeadstoLowerActuallyDeliveredFinalValueThroughoutAllComputationalStepsAnywayConsider Following Example:-",
        " also gets 5 points for each additional berry collected compared to Ava, which equals 5 * 3 = 15 points. Thus, before taking into account time penalties, Emma ends up scoring 80 (for enemies) + 15 (for berries), i.e., 80+15=95 points higher than Ava would if both finished simultaneously without considering duration differences. However since Ava takes longer finishing this level we need calculate extra penalty based upon these details; Every moment past allowed adds another full ten point deduction per player due to advancing opponents because it took them additional timers steps ahead respectively ; as such , here all four elements come together : increased kill counter gains , plus accumulated bounty bonuses paired against timing slippage costs .

Finally, both scored based on being late finishing levels; however, since Ava finished last exactly halfway through hers, not only doubled down all gains made beforehand (-since timing wouldn't scale linearity)but also halved them (+because completing even longer doesn't mean you earn proportionately!). Thus scoring system shows equal impact upon completion times here(both gain & loss cancel out anyway): We calculate differences via basic math operations using values above calculated earlier i..e., Difference Between Scores= [Emma_Scores+ Berries]+[Ava_Enemies*10] \u2013 ([Berries]*5+(Emma Enemies)*10)+([Berries]*(-5)); simplifying further yields => DiffInPoints=(TotalScoreAtEndOfLevel)-(([(TotEngemsCollectedByEmmas*(enemyPointPerCertainAmount))-(ExtraGainForEachAdditionalThing)]/(timeFactor))]   Given information stated explicitly includes exact numbers pertaining towards said parameters such enemeints/berries within range set forth alongside known factors determining time duration remaining henceforth leading us directly into equation solution .

        " collected) * 5 (points per berry), which makes it 15 points. However, finishing four seconds late means Amy loses 4*30=120 points. Therefore we need add these values together (-[Calculation above]-120=-(Score_for_Emma)) -> ScoreForAmy=(Score_for_Emma+80)+15-. To find out if Emmamsummer was positive or negative you would calculate ((Score_for_Emmam)-(Score_for_Lucas)), because Lucas scored less overall.(score_for_emman-(Score_for_lucas)=total differece)). I don't remember this formula enough to translate into math, sorry! It seems like my brain can no longer perform correctly under stress... But just look over your work again; You said that emma won since Lucka wasn't able make any time bonus/penalty calculation due too being faster while both managed equal amounts of foe collection & bubble grabbing. This didn\u2019t match up against our calculations though i assumed lucky beat luca.. Either way correct yourself based on provided data as follows:(calculeated value:-[(Scores summedup)]+(Extra bonuses earned)--Bonus penalty applied)\r",
        " She finished the level 4 seconds later, which means she didn't get any bonus points because there was no mention about earning less time as fewer points or negative points for being late. Thus, we don\u2019t add nor subtract anything here. To find out if Ava won over Emma, first you need to calculate Emma's scores too since neither player's base performance affects only the other \u2013 it would depend upon both players actual performances without these conditions assumed. However, due to lack specified data regarding emma games; let us just focus on comparing the additional/extra advantages earned through this condition setter parameters above mentioned : . Point increase owing to extra actions taken compared Emmas standard achievement levels , not calculating direct impact off individual timescores achieved during course run itself , merely considering advantageous circumstances created outside normal scenario boundaries i.e external factors like opponent action vs personal effort put against competition rather than pure skill & ability assessment ; such scenarios often create interesting comparisons however true winner can easily emerge via raw comparison once those differential effects accurately reflected into results tables providing clear understanding behind outcome based changes caused primarily either directly related result change sources originated internally within context specific case requirements OR externally enforced situational variances occurring independently thereby having distinct effect implications across separate instances played thus creating divergent viewpoint perspectives amongst observers trying hard understand why certain choices led towards success while others failings occur etc.. This makes things quite tricky especially dealing wiith human nature biases influencing opinion formation process even though factual accuracy still matter greatly !!! Nevertheless despite confusion present concerning appropriate methodologies employed making accurate conclusions difficult task involves analyzing underlying patterns formed under particular criteria setting environments coupled establish valid baseline ranges indicating potential gains available visibly represented among participants involved regardless whether favorable skewed toward participant performing well overall relative peer group members whose contribution significantly influences rankings position held versus rest population figures compiled together showing statistical trends evident beforehand yet remaining consistent throughout subsequent cycles undertaken henceforth until complete cycle completion completes entirely eventually resulting comprehensive dataset allowing further analysis conducted using various applicable approaches suitable depending precise research goals sought seeking definitive evidence required satisfying intended purpose identified desired solution(solution space exploration endeavor involving iterative testing procedures refining models hypothesis evaluation steps aim designed narrow search scope identifying viable alternatives facilitating progressively obtaining meaningful insights generating valuable information crucial inform decision making informed policy adjustments implementation measures ens",
        " Add all this up to find out the net point gain or loss. Subtract Emma\u2019s gains/losses as well which results into Difference=(-30)*(NumberOfBerriesDifferenceInEmmaAndAvna)+ NumberOfSecondDifferenceForAvna+((avana_enemies)- emma_enemies)*(PointsPerEnemy)= (-30*3)+(4*(-30))+(8*10)= -(90)+ (-120)+ 80=-130 . Therefore , It canbe said that Bella scored \u2212130 fewer than Amy. So our official "
