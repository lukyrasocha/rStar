But we need not break down every single day here because instead we can use exponential growth concept which suits better for such situations. When one unit (a human) multiplies other units(infecting 6), it leads us directly into Power Rule multiplication situation like `total_count=initial_number*(rate^days)`. Here rate represents individuals getting infected per current count while also considering time period or days passed. Rate would simply translate into those being newly made sick i.e., becoming victims henceforth due to preexisting cases (`newly afflicted`+already existing). Therefore , you might state power rule formula without explicitly mentioning exponent term `(base*power)`because exponents actually represent quantity affected rather than indicating discrete steps towards increased health crises .

Therefore you apply multiplication directly rather than exponentiation based rule since exponential model isn\u2019t applicable here due no compounding factor within daily cycle itself . Hence multiply base value i.e..

        " r^n`, where 'a' represents the amount (ten) initially affected; 'r' signifies the proportionate increase per time period/unit interval (each individual causing disease transmission effectively multiplies the count); \u2018n\u2019 indicates lengthy duration or unit intervals passed(days). Hence it translates into calculating [10*((6^3))]=10*(216)=2160 individuals contaminated following this viral spread trajectory over a span of thrice daily periods. To sum up, your question asks about counting all those exposed during these specified durations without isolation measures affecting numbers \u2013 hence my method above assumes perfect conditions for virus propagation leading to theoretical maximization.
