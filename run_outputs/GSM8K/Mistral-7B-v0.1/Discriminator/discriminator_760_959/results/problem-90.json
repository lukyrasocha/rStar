        "; i.e., subtract (from the original amount) ten(x/-)times one(the factor being taken off), twelve (twice four). This means we calculate 10*1=10 goats removed from Farm X while adding back the same times twenty-fourteen (=two tens minus sixes))goats to represent the remaining quantity in Farmy Y which equals to remove all but four (+4,-10+(-14)). We find out this way our resultant equation would look like [(FarmX_original numbers)-ten]+(farmY[its initial counts -(minus)] twentytwelve)=total count hence when put numerically it turns into , [55-(10)]=[45--12]=45 plus (-4)=41 total goat stock.So, 45-10 equated against Fmry Y\u2019s forty-five substracting its negative eighteen ([((45)+18);=(nine thirty-three))]result yields ninety three [-33]. Therefore multiplying [[[(Nineteen Thirty Three)_new count][minus)(fifty]]]+[[Total Number Of Goats initially found _above](forty eleven)] resultsinto eight hundred seventeen[-seventeen].[[(September Thirt One)[New Stock Count Minus Fifty)](Two Hundred Seventeen)];([Hundred Eighty ElevenMinusedSixtyOneEqualsTwenty])];([Final Tale Two HundredAndEighteen]).",
