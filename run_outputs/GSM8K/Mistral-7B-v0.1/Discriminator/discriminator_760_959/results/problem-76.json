This means that X=20 . Substitute these values back into both instances identifying what amount one person produces. We see immediately that since \u201cX\u201d represents Rory \u2018created,\u2019 this equals 20 Clay Dish creations. Hence, substituting again gets Jada making doubled quantities , so therefore getting :  2*X=40 Clay Dish Creations which would equal four times or forty items combined along with kora\u2019s twenty item count!

To identify the value of 'x', substitute it into our assumption statement above which becomes; since Jada makes 2*Rory, replace Rory(r) with r so we get j=2r meaning Jada's amount equals double whatever quantity of clay dishes Rory comes up with i.e if you let Rory take out say k sheets of paper...you can multiply that figure times three (k*n)=the same thing but multiplied by n instead of adding another sheet.

Solve when you find out what x equals. Since Rory\u2019s amount times three needs to equal one hundred fifty-five since no other information was presented about quantity being shared or different amounts I assumed here numbers would line up evenly if divided among them totalling thirty eight per person which works best through trial & error until finding appropriate values using equations such as those provided above combined .
