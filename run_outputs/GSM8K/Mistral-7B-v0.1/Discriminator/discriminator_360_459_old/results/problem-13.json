Each remora measures six inches so together their summed length is \\( 2 \\times 6 \\) inches \\(\\text{or}~ 12\\) inches. To find out what portion they make as a part of its full size you just need to divide one quantity (the amount of interest) by another (that\u2019s going to serve as base). That means dividing `remoras` totals over entire creature height using formula \\[ {part\\over whole}=\\frac{{length\\_of_remoras}}{{height_sharks}}\\] Plugging values we get \\[\\frac{12}{120}\\] Simplify the fraction getting \\[\\frac{1}{10}= .1= 1/10\\] Change decimal representation (\\(x/y=\\), etc.) back into percent notation [\\(\\% \\rightarrow \\underline{x}/\\overline{y}\\)].
