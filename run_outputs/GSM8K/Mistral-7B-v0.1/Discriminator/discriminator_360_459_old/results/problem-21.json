Hence its weight can be determined using multiplication like this;  48 divided over 8 multiplied (.75), or simply one third times forty eight equals sixteen grains when converted back onto integers.. Therefore adding their values twenty twelve plus seventeen grams together comes out equaling thirty seven grains altogether!
