Finally let me rephrase my previous statement which might clear any doubts still persisting amongst readers here ; only those who respond once per round contribute meaningfully till n rounds taken; others just cause noise without adding value What I want you guys understand correctly here---only one reply counts within single loop until desired depth reached Otherwise repetitions start contributing nothing essentially making entire effort redundant due both redundancy caused extra cost involved & non effective use resource wise allocation towards achieving same goal Instead repeating oneself multiple times leads towards never ending cycles thus effectively rendering whole concept useless Besides doing basic math sums like addition/subtraction seems easier option considering large scale operations whereas multiplications ensure scaling factor remains constant hence keeping overall impact consistent across varying levels Thus following correct approach helps maintain consistency throughout process regardless quantity level Hence above clarity provided assists better understanding underlying principles related problem solving approaches required while dealing similar situations Hope all make sense !!! Best Regards .. :) ... My apologies beforehand but realized posting simple direct sequence formula failed noticeably missing out important detail about avoiding duplicates While yes certain methods could technically detect duplicate entries somehow however most efficient way yet proven practical involves using tracking systems themselves designed specifically purpose such cases Where tracker sets flag mark already registered entities accordingly allowing further efforts focused instead solely gaining unprecedented results Without doubt these complexities highlight necessity behind thorough planning steps necessary right off bat prior initiate phoning action Ensure absolute zero overlap indeed guarantee complete uniqueness achieved Everyone else seem okay though , keep trying despite challenges ahead Good luck Moving forward remember : Quality > Quantity Precisely Measuring Results Validation Required Thorough Planning Diligence Demand Flexibility Perseverance Teamwork Essential Practical Knowledge Patience Always learning Never settling Keep pushing boundaries No excuses Compromising standards Will lead too far Achievement Desired Outcome Seems feasible",

Similarly calculate till third & fourth stages also obtaining following results consecutively: R1=3*3R2=(3)*(3)^1R3=(3)*(3)^2R4=(3)*(3)^3.
