Multiply weeks/months times rate equals our figure to add or subtract. It tells me I lose my mass linearly so when figuring out what caused changes one might consider using multiplication rather than addition since if i went down consistently no matter wether you go upwards(rate) instead of just adding all your losses would affect less.
