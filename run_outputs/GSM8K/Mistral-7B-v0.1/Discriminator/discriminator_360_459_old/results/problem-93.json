Hence, so it leads us up to calculate as follows:-140 minus 48 equals negative 92 Which essentially tells us that Bill doesn\u2019t even cover the required quota if only using those existing stockpiles hence making no new purchase necessary since otherwise subtraction could lead zeroes instead of negatives thus indicating exactly sufficient quantities provided all things stay constant but unfortunately not practical within reality due to unforeseen circumstances causing fluctuations including evaporation leading towards increased consumption ultimately compelling him into acquiring yet another supply batch.

Since everybody doesn't necessarily drink twice during every visit, considering maximum requirement would make us able to provide enough supply if unexpected demand comes up due either unnoticed arrival or sudden increase in consumption rate among attending members..
