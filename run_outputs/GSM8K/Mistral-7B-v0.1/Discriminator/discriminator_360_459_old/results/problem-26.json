Because we know time equals distance divided by speed; calculating this means dividing the overall mileage across which James jogs during one entire week by speed implies converting all distances back into equivalent units before conducting further calculations (in this instance feet or meters). Since our current values represent metrics already expressed within common American standards such as pounds(weight measurement)for body weight etc.), direct conversion might seem unnecessary but serves primarily when dealing exclusively with larger spatial volumes like kilometerstotallymeasuresgreaterthanonemileper meterorkilometersmoreacrossanabundanceofsurfaceareawhereconversioncouldbecrucialtodetermineappropriatevaluesbetweencompetingunitslikemetersvsfeetandsoonothersuchaslifespanamongorganismscalculateddifferentlyaccordingtopersonalfactorsleadingpotentialvariationalifeexpectancyresultsrangingfromdecadesintosingledayswithdistinctinterpretationsrelatedtotheindividualstudied.

To find out exactly how long James runs over those 5 days based strictly upon their pace (i.e., excluding breaks), all you need to know was already mentioned; since speed refers solely to 'distance traveled relative to time taken', not necessarily counting down rest periods or break times included as separate variables within your calculation scenario.
