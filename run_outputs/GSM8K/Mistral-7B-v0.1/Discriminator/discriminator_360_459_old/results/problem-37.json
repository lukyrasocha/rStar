Since this occurred across multiple time periods known as 'weeks,' you would want to multiply this dollar amount by those same frequency figures--in other words, since Paul made similar journeys repeatedly over sixteen consecutive occasions or instances ('days'), it means one whole instance was repeated eighteen separate individual intervals('time frames'). Thus multiplying our already calculated value into account all seventeen full cycles/repetitions which results finally yielding back us again its original computation just shifted forward within different temporal contextual scope without changing numerical essence---i.e., reiterated calculations remain constant thus maintain integrity whilst also remaining sensitive towards nuance brought forth through shifting perspectives upon consideration such factors like chronology etc..

To solve this problem we need to recognize that each element refers to either digits or terms used when multiplying numbers, but not directly related mathematical operations involving addition like our original question asked. We know 'sixes' refer to multiples of 6 (like 6x1, 6x2...)and similarly 'twos' might mean pairs/multiples of two (such as 2x1, etc.).

Finally divide even payments equally among all passengers before adding up totals so no single trip gets undervalued or misestimated overall expense sum due partial contributions made towards shared commutes throughout workdays since everyone benefits alike financially whenever someone opts against public transit methods instead opting personal automobility options available within most urban metropolises which often include owning/renting vehicles based off individual preferences according current needs circumstances existent daily around us everywhere whether private home ownership occurs directly inside residential neighborhood sectors nearby business districts situated centrally across towns country sides rural areas suburbs etc..
