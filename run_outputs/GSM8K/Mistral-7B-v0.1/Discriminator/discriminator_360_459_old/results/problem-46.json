        " Since one dog requires only half as much (one) pairs since these include both footwear. Hence; six animals need three complete sets which amounts to ($12*3)=$36 in monetary value worth. Thus, It would take $36 to purchase enough shoes/booties if buying brand new single items otherwise using second hand ones might cut down this amount considerably depending upon their original quality i.e condition before wear was already inflicted.. But considering no information about any kind or sale discount(offers), we assume here just purchasing those newly made customized bootie accessories matching exactly individual leg lengths ensuring optimum comfort while skiing off mountainous terrains during winter season without incurring additional expenses due repairs/weldings required post use under harsh environmental weather conditions such wind blasts blowng ice particles across skis edge causing potential damage when used heavily over time .. so going back full circle lets us finally round out our calculations keeping above assumptions intact & thus providing comprehensive summary .
