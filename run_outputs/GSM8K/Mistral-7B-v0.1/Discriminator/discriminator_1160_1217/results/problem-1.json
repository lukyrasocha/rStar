Because we\u2019re told here Abraham gained \\$50 as profit due to sale therefore if you divide both sides of original equation by $\\$50$, resulting ratio represents pricing rate; namely $(\\frac{\\$$80}{\\$_50})$, equivalently $(1\\tfrac{3}{5})$ or simply 1.$\\\\( \\\\frac{3}{5}$. To find what portion was sold secondly according to the narrative take note that one quarter ($(\\frac{1}{4})$) remains undistributed meaning three quarters ($\\frac{3}{4}$), i.e., triple quantity expressed via numeral values($\\frac{3 \\times 80}{4}$)=$\\underline {60}$sq .m^2)$. Again since sell yielded $\\$30$, dividing sales proceeding over cost basis results reveals quotient representing valuation unit rate:$(\\frac{\\$30}{\\$_60}=\\frac{1}{2})$. By multiplying obtained ratios together allows calculation corresponding revenue acquired upon full dispositional eventuality thereby:$(1.\\overline{3})\\;\\rm{(unit\\;price)} \\times (\\frac{1}{2})\\;\\rm{(volume\\,rate})=\\frac{4}{3}\\,\\times\\,\\frac{1}{2}=0.67\\,\\mathrm{\\$} \\;/ \\, \\mathrm{sq\\;m}$.

Therefore, Abraham initially earned $(50+30+$3*<<80-(40+20)=20>>20 ) or ($80+$60=$ <<80+60=140>>$140). Hence based on these transactions we can conclude that it took him roughly twelve months before he finally gained complete revenue over this piece property as stated within question stem stating 'after a month'. Subsequent calculation shows he accumulated a net gain equalling just under twice what was paid out during sales; i.e., ~($3*20)-2*$30=(~$60-$60)/twelve), yielding approximately equal profit realized through each transaction when compared against initial cost invested thereby validating original claim regarding income generation rate tied directly back solely unto purchasing price point itself without any regard whether time frame involved actually played role concerning same outcome achieved throughout full cycle analysis process provided herein upon completion only following careful review performed above showing otherwise not necessarily true assumption made early though certainly false enough resulting miscalculation errors occurring instead whenever taken verbatim approach employed firsthand leading ultimately towards incorrect conclusion rendered unnecessary thanks largely because proper methodology applied earlier failed therefore leaving behind no doubt about why such mistake occurred however perhaps better understanding comes forth along way too quick pace thus far since getting caught up mostly likely trying something new like calculating values quickly whereas most p le wouldnnt bother even checking math unless absolutely essential which could explain lack basic knowledge needed simply due fact nobody understand stuff well until experience learns things naturally bit hard sometimes especially considering human nature tends heavily toward lazy behavior whatever its form becomes regardless age group level education background personal circumstances etc..

His profit would accumulate up until reaching twenty transactions because the cost wasn\u2019t factored into calculating possible returns.

However, since you seek only numerical outcomes disregarding these temporal relations, let me assist accordingly based solely upon those parameters exclusively focused on computational procedures without integrating supplementary chronological inferences related to particular historic incidents like presidential inaugurations associated with known instances of late occurrences potentially affecting subsequent hours of operation\u2014such hypothetical conditions don\u2019t typically align directly with direct mathematical operations involved herewith specified",
        " Abraham starts out owning 80 square meters of land which he divides up into thirds (since we first see him sell 'half', or one slice of three). Half plus quarter amounts to fourteen squares; therefore thirty-six remain because twelve minus fourteen equals negative two but squared returns us back to eighty [square feet] owned entirely since negatives don't actually appear when dealing with area]. Thus ,he earned [(\u00bd \u00d7$50)+(\u00bc\u00d7[$30])+(\u2154x($3)],or,[(\u2013[\u2153][80]+$12=+[24]=+$20)=*$80=$160 overall. Hence, Abraham will make $160 if he manages to complete this sale arrangement perfectly without any loss due to inflation rates changing etc.. That\u2019s not very realistic though \u2013 normally business would lose about twenty percent every year so let me throw it down mathematically instead : ($2^2*log_e(e^(160))) / log_(e)^($2.40/$4),which rounds off roughly around ~~-$24~~to~$-(240)*\u2248-.76=-$.

        " $3 per m\u00b2. To solve this problem we need calculate (total value) \u2013 ($50+$30+($3\u00d7the rest)). First divide quantity divided as follows : \u00bd\u00f7\u00bc=\u00bd or multiply both sides by its reciprocal; multiplication results into division problems having same result .Then using basic math operations ,we find out what part remains unsold when starting wit 80 sqm ; Half which equals  40sqm & one fourth also equaling 20 sqm so combined these quantities subtract them like mentioned above i..e 80 minus those two numbers you get your reminder squared inches , therefore since I used whole number values my subtraction resulted within such single digits integer range thus leaving me with no decimals nor fractions involved however if working through non integers could possibly produce decimal answers perhaps even round off downward etc depending upon whether either denominator divisible perfectly according exactly once only making calculation extremely easy hence why doing calculations via fraction vs dividing directly yields simplest form possible solution without messy steps needed later trying figure everything neatly organized properly together\u2026but anyway onto calculating amount actually received back instead just yet simply put take whatever piece size still needs purchased plus already paid $$$ multiplied over again times rate charged currently being sought here namely three thirty cents USD btw sorry forgot add tax charges included please excuse!
