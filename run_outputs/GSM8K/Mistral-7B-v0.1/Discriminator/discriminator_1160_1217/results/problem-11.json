Given what was said about being 'the remainder equals exactly 1000 sq ft', subtracting these last 1000sq ft makes sense because nothing could fit into space lesser without leaving unaccountable residue! Therefore adding every bit together like before but taking away extra spaces found doesn\u2019t yield correct totals. Hence considering such considerations alongside stated facts above allows us conclude something different; namely since any discrepancy occurred owing largely due partly towards misunderstanding implied assumptions related specifically regarding measurement units applied whilst undertaking calculations pertaining smaller sized remaining part(likely kitchen etc.), therefore accordingly calculating exact overall household footage via direct addition might appear contradictory hence indirect inferences concerning possible misconception originated around interpretative clarity needed while analyzing provided details critically thereby impacting accuracy consequently affectively challenges established methodologies otherwise commonly adopted when approaching similar problems generally involving geometric calculation requiring comprehensive understanding vis-a-vis context specific nuances surrounding utilitarian purposes sought through numerical assessments aimed facilitating informed decision making process based upon collected data derived thus ensuring efficient resource allocation optimized against multiple objectives pursued concurrently further contributing significantly toward minimizing unnecessary expenditure enabling increased accessibility maximization promoting improved wellbeing potentially influencing broader societal benefits including environmental sustainability enhancement initiatives albeit contested debates persisting over optimal balance striking harmony aligning divergent interests navigated judiciously amidst dynamically evolving landscapes constantly shaping intricate interdependencies dictating course corrections necessitated responding adeptness reflective expertise underpinning critical examination skills essential adapting strategies accordingly safeguarding best interest preserved holistic approach advocating collective progress championing shared prosperity inclusivity embracing diversity cultivating mutual respect honoring dignity affirmation preserving liberty rights justice fair equality opportunity advancing human potential fostering peaceful coexistence securing stability nurturing growth development transformational change spurring positive evolution driving global betterment catalyzing innovation inspiring collaboration sparking creativity igniting passion fueling dedication engendering commitment harvesting success achievement reap bountiful reward celebrating triumph lauding",

Let\u2018s try calculating what its size would represent when compared against individual measurements defined previously; let\u00b4s say our equation reads `Living Room Size X Bedroom Sizes= Total House Space`, rearranging terms further results into `X [size per single unit/bed] ^ NumberOfUnits[single units]=TotalAvailableSpace`. To find out the value of X plugging all values available yields `(SizePerSingleUnit^(NumberofBedrooms+\u201cliving\u201d))^NbdRoom`/(TotalearHouseArea). Replacing known quantities leaves us finally coming across : `((SizeperSingledevice)^TotalDevices)/totalhousearea` . Using these guiding principles , substitute your previous calculation i.e.( Bedsize*No_ofbds)+Livingsize=[Totallvgthespace]. By simplifying you get:(Liveingroomspace)*nbdrooms=(totalhousesapace)-( No Of bdrs*(singledevice spaces)). Substitutin values:`[(x)^5]*([number o f rooms])=(square footage)[unknown]`.
