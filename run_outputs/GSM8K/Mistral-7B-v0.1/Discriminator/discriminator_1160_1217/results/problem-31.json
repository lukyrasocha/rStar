What was the relevant and irrelevant factor in determining the price of May\u2019s haircut and color? Relevant factors include the original length of May's hair before cutting (since this directly influences the amount charged), the cost of processing ($30 per inch) because it provides us information about the calculation needed based upon hair reduction level, and explicitly stated additional charge related exclusively to colour($40). Irrelevantly, specific terms such as \u2018hers or mine,\u2019 names like \u2018may,\u201d personal attributes if any aren't mentioned regarding payment capacities.'
