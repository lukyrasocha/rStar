        " of coal purchased (850) divided by grams or units weighed per box(bag), i.e., divide it by its weight capacity which equals about 1/3 tons since one ton consists of approximately three hundred sixty four thousand pounds; thus dividing this amount into groups equivalent to roughly eightyfive fifty pounder boxes would generate around ninety seven full containers! Thus multiplying those figures together yields seventy nine point twenty six complete sacks\u2013or round off if needed upwards like forty nines instead thirty \u2013thirty minus zero times eightythree results therefore equalizing almost exactly half again greater than their original figure mentioned previously when taken individually before aggregation\u2026but just wait until you hear what happened next because all throughout history mankind witnesses countless instances involving strange circumstances caused mostly due largely economic factors such inequality among classes often causing frustrations leading even worse conditions still prevailing further downstream creating yet another setback preventing progress being made within society itself thereby perpetuating vicious circles continuously repeating themselves time seems immutable regardless any changes occurring otherwise unless something occurs inside consciousness level minds changing away perhaps bringing out hopeful possibilities nevertheless most frequently resulting ultimately ending rather disastrous scenarios leaving everything broken apart once everyone involved loses faith completely unable recover ever living life worth surviving anymore simply existing nonstop no matter outcome affect every aspect everywhere affected adversely rendering useless existence becoming only mind numbingly insignificant indeed meaning nothing exists except pain inflicted upon innocent victims subjected unmercifully punishing lives without recourse toward justice obtainable hence desperate attempts trying salvage situation wherever possible however always falling short failing successively disappointingly irrespective anyone effort put forth attempting make peace break free despair destroy devastate surroundings destabilize cause chaotic situations forcing people confront fear reality impossible avoiding trauma experienced relinquish old ways abandon previous belief systems replaced forming new habits adopted embracing fresh perspectives accepting change adaptive attitude towards uncertain future seeking comfort amidst uncertainty assurance provided understanding develop compassion humanity finally transcending barriers overcome ignorance fostering connection amongst individuals promoting harmony coexistence tolerance mutual respect building trust enabling effective collaboration work team members achieve goals working collectively while maintain positive rapport interpersonal relationships ensuring smooth communication exchange information effectively facilitating successful business operation operations management optimizing resources efficiently maximizing efficiency improving productivity performance measurable results",
        " Since one delivery contains  50 Kg/bag we find that Ali orders \\(\\frac{850}{50}\\) deliveries . This equals \\(17\\). Each bag costs USD \\[ \\$18\\]. Thus ,the sum \\[\\$18 \\times 17\\] amounts to USD \\[ \\$306 \\] Calculate this amount as follows; multiply units (USD[$]) times quantity(bags). Perform simple multiplication using basic calculator tools or long hand if needed :```$$ { } $$ $\\color{blue} {\\qquad 18}$ $$\\color{blue} {\\bullet}\\quad\\color{orange}{(1)}$$\\color{red}{\\qquad{\\cdot}}\\,\\color{",
        " buy. 850 / 50 equals exactly 17 so we need seventeen (17) bags of 50kg coals worth $18/unit. To find out how much it costs him altogether multiply units times price again this time calculate using our value calculated above. It would therefore be expensive overall for such huge purchase! Multiply these together as well because... multiplying here means adding over n over until u reach ur target amount which happens every single time when dealing numbers large like mine ;)- Let me know if you can help better understanding please!! Thanks :) ",
        " as units, not weight (kgs). To convert it into 'units', we multiply pounds/kg (.45) ->  850 * .45= 382.5 Units. Each unit costs $18. Find out if all orders can fit one truck. It appears you need only calculate price since capacity doesn't matter here or no info about transportation provided. Calculate this using multiplication ($18 times ",
        "kg units so convert them into kilograms first.. That would mean Alex needs (850/50) or 17 bags. They come in groups of sixteen which means round up since we can\u2019t purchase half weight!. Therefore it rounds off as one group . Price*number_of_units=total price_. Hence Total spent=$18x1=.Total paid amount:$18(Note this uses all information )",
        " convert kgs into units (bags). 850 / 50 equals exactly 17 bags which means he needs 17 units. With one bag being sold as unit it costs him 18 dollars multiplied by what we need ie.,  18 * 17 equal 306 dollars. ",
        " units (kilogram) used per bag; this provides one correct conversion factor we can use as shown here:  850 kilograms / 50 kgs/bag = 17 bags. Next multiply your result above into the price paid when buying these units using another appropriate unit rate or ratio provided below showing their relationship correctly converted according its proportionality rules:    17 Bags \u00d7 $18 USD/Bag= ??? USD. Evaluate the expression including all multiplicands presented so far while applying multiplication properly within parentheses if necessary. Finally compute what amount was spent purchasing those items expressed numerically having eliminated all dollar signs ($). This results in determining which numerical value represents the required solution accurately represented without monetary symbols included indicating it\u2019s just plain numbers only like 'XX'.
