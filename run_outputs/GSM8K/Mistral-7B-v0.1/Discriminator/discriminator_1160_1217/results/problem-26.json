        " 3 = 9 miles.  On Tuesday and Thursday, he ran twice as far which would add another 5 miles times 2 equals 10.   Therefore, adding these together makes it equal to 9+10=19. Thus we can see Sam runs altogether (Monday through Saturday) 19 mi during one full week(on Sunday).So finally our correct answer was mentioned beforehand but just not written out fully like I am doing here. We don\u2019t need to write everything including what happened over the whole course of seven days since only three different amounts or numbers appear within its equation so no complication occurs due oversight making things difficult when writing down all separate events throughout those specific amount(days), instead if anyone asked simply summing values such quantities listed previously pertaining specifically related directly towards calculation needed; therefore following logic process allows us straight away without having any problems solving problem using basic math knowledge required!

        " remaining running activities makes it  5 (Tuesday) + 5(Thursday)= 10 miles. Summing these both together make its     9+10= 19 milkies Total amount which samahe was ridden .the ",
        " From Tuesday and Thursday (5+5) equaling ten .So ,all together it makes :  9(from Mon,Wed & Fri)+10=19 mikes.. The answer is: 19."
