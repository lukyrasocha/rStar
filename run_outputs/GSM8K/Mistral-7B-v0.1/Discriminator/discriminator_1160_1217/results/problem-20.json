Let g=the quantity of freshly purchased products i.e., all remaining but spoiled ones equal w*(g+(w))/(2*w), as only half product remains fresh ((2*.5)*x=(w) so divide it out). Here if you replace 'W' which means worth or value (=price\u00d7quantity here; don\u2019t forget about volume!) into this equation. Next we plug everything back together & multiply both sides by W: frac{(q)(p)}{[frac{f}{(f+b)]}. This translates into Fresh Milk Refund Equation: [(refund)/([profit]).
