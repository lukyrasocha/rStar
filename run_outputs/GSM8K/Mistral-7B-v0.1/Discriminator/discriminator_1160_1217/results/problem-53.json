Given that all but last installment are already collected via Steven\u2019s yearly settlement plan means only one transaction remains undone meaning; since outstanding balance before completing series stands at $581 subtracting regular expenses till completion period leaves leftover funds available for extra charges thus resulting into required single bill totalling worth(i.e.$581-$275=$306+additional fees); hence during twelveth round ,he promises himself returning doubled principle along wtih accrued interests thereby clearing off any past dues leaving both siblings free & happy once again!

We want to know the value once all fees/interest charges are included before repayment begins during the eleventh cycle\u2014this can be seen as follows ((principal loans*rate)+remaining balance). Hence $(($300*$0.02)$+(all costs))=(3+306)/monthly payment=$309/. Therefore when finding the sum needed upon reaching the last scheduled date if no other actions take place such adjustments made earlier throughout periods totals becoming=((previous period cost)+next fee)[or]($(new rate*$balance$)]. Meaning since everything else remains constant over time herein includes neither reducing nor increasing any previously agreed values,(so new term price=.calculated base plus next installment)(we see just previous conditions remain unchanged despite accumulating expenses hence why we use present rates alongside current account balances), thus using those principles shown above results in the equation resulting being (=(.3*306$) + (.2*$(306-$25)])=$(91.8$ + $.2x$).

        " calculate this value determine the difference between what Stephen promises (the annual equivalent payment) compared to just one regular single instalment ($25): Annual Equivalent Payment = Single Installation Amount / Number of Monthly Installments; so we can say : Total Repayment = Principal Amount or Initial Owed Money (A) Anually compounded Interest Rate ((r*100/N)) N \u2013 Periodic Interval Count(in case here periodicity equals year); hence our equation looks like following calculation steps below ; Step 1 Multiplies annually occurring times within Borrow Duration using count(); Since Stepen\u2019s repayment occurs only once every other month (=every second interval). We know thus all time intervals equal six (from January till December), excluding February which lies exactly halfway through these terms as indicated above during borrower obligations due dates.
