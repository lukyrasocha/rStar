Therefore, the dentist fixes fifty percent or half of James' natural teeth; it can also say fourteen and a fifth or 5/9ths of his set, if expressed proportionately but not converted into percentage form yet since you asked just simply 'percentage'. However, upon converting these fractions back into decimal forms when necessary, herein lies our required solution because only decimals correspond directly to standard notation used within per cent calculation framework \u2013 thus concluding such conversion would yield exactly .50 being synonymous entirely equivalent both symbolically numerically across divergent representations including , %.

        " To find out what percentage this represents out of all his teeth (which we know as being 'x'), you divide these capped teeth by 'x'. That means dividing 11/30*100%.
