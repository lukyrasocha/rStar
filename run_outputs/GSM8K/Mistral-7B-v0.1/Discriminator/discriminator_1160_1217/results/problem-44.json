        " Team Alpha found which was stated to be 40%. Calculate this amount using multiplication; 700 times 40/100 equals 280. Subtracting these initial finds leaves us with (700 \u2013 280) or 420 shells still undiscovered. Next we consider Team Finders who uncovered 60 percent out of those leftover shells. Multiplying their share yields (420 \u00d7 .60) equaling 252. Finally subtract both totals from overall discoveries ((700\u2013(280+252)) yield our last group, the Goggle Techons finding (700-(280+252)= 16).

Convert these percentages to fractions to help solve it \u2013 40% means out of every hundred or ten instead of forty which makes calculation easier especially because we know no decimals can appear since our denominators won't match up so simplify accordingly; divide both sides evenly across until only integers remain within one another thus making calculations less complicated while still being accurate enough such algebraically simplified forms enable us better visualize answers visually/graphically when drawing graphs based purely upon variables without actually solving them numerically using math operations but rather through pure logic / reasoning skills utilized during mathematics problems like ones involving linear functions etc..

        " calculate their share; subtract it from the initial amount to get what remained. Calculate the quantity retrieved by Team The Finder out of this remainder using percentages (but consider only whole numbers since fractional amounts don\u2019t make practical sense). Subtract both these quantities obtained by Teams Alpha and The Finders respectively against original count so you can know exactly about the output or contribution made towards shell collection i.e., contributions \u2013= leftovers => leftovers represents outputs/contribution of group known here(Goggetter). This result serves best if converted back also within context boundaries thus : Result=(Leftover)*TotalCount -> Groupname_X's input equals \u2018Result\u2018 Here 'GroupAlpha','TeamFindings',and finally ,\"TreasureHunters\". Each name stands strong representing different entities responsible for collecting individual shares mentioned initially .

        " (team Alpha) Collect the amount of seashells not collected by this team (the rest). Multiply the above result by what we know about Team Finder\u2019s ratio to get their count . subtract those numbers together ,which would leave us just enough information needed to solve our problem . Since I need only one question solution so let me generate first part quickly ..so : Total No Of Seashells= Taken %*total$/100  ..........    or .........      =     **T**where **i** means independent variable       Let i represent no of collection made upfront                        By team alpha(A)=40*$T / 100                         Rest_sea($R)$=Total$ \u2013 $TeamAlphacount ;               Which mean $$ R=$T$-$$TA ; $$\\frac{RT }{100 }-$$\\frac {AT}{100}$$=\\frac{TR \u2212 AT }{100}=$\\alpha S.$$ $\\bf{\\therefore \\quad}$ This implies that Remaining Sea ($RS$) = ***Remainder=(Rest sea+AlphaSea)$$ = (\\frac{ TR\u2212 AT }{ 100}+ )40 \\% $or....... $((\\frac{ TR\u00a0-\\text {at} }{ 100})+\\frac{(40\\,*\\,\\frac{TR -\\text{{at}}}{\\text {independentVariable}\\_, T}}{100})$\u2026 which further simplifies to $\\frac{(tr +\\textbf{-}\\textit{$A })}{Tr}/100$. \u2026let B denote NumberOfCollectByBothTeamsSo;NumberOfCollectionMadeUpForrest=*(numberofcollectmadeupfortheothertwo)-NoOfCollectionsMadeUpFORbtheseamberoultainyouturnthenumberoftotalcollectionsremaining$(AfterALPHAtakesHisSharesFromTHEMOTEADS)$.FinallyThen you use algebra again taking remainder times 60%, since That group takes half of anything leftover And You End Up With THE",
