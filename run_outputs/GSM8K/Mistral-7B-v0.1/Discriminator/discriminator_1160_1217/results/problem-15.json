It was mentioned that Team A could only score one fourth of what Team B managed; since we know Team B scored four times as many (or rather twelve) when you account for both halves combined, hence three quarters or Three Fourths (.75), meaning .75*4=three per quarter means  3x3=total nineteen points made by Team B throughout both periods compared to twenty eight overall by Team A implies therefore if one considers just the initial phase identified before considering all other factors equaling out across time, subtract seven minus twice equals once point goal difference favorable towards us herein described scenario.

Calculate the goal ratio established during halftime for Teams A & B respectively based on their last games as mentioned here; let\u2019s say Team A was C_score , meanwhile Group B score is G_Score . Accordingly : FH = {Cx^0.7y ; Gy} -> SHFG(first-half-goal). With no explicit numbers provided we cannot accurately calculate individual values but can only provide this formulaic expression using placeholder terms. Given that information alone isn't enough to solve our problem since specific numerical details required aren't present. However usually when solving such problems you need data like actual goal counts or average ratios across multiple matches pertaining to performance trends under different game scenarios etc..
