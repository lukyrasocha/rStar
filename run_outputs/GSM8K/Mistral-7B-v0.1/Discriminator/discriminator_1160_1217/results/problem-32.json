Since however Mrs Jones earned extra $$$ via completing her tasks every working period -- those funds could amount significantly higher once all overtime compensations accruing among them considered collectively alongside possible sick leave benefits available thereto arising out owing solely unto being well treated consistently throughout said employment tenure\u2026 Therefore ultimately let us assume:- Total regular earnings obtained within single calendar year i=regular_salary-$base+bonus=$a..b._i^-+vac-pay=(regular_{salary})*(no{month}-o){days})\\cdot$(percents)(regu{\\~}lar_{\\text{%}})$-(oversea\\{travel\\_income\\}\\cup(expenses)+tax)={$}_R$-($T+$V)$.

        " these hours without considering overtime pay or sick leave. Multiplying this value (hours) times unit price ($1.5/hour), we find 180 x $1.5 = $270 as gross income before bonus receipts. Finally add bonuses received during April for no unexcused absence according to company policy. Since it was stated that Jane didn\u2019t miss any shifts throughout April, which means compliance to the policies. Add together their base wages plus performance rewards earned based upon meeting specific employment guidelines, thus getting net compensation amounting up tot $270+$10= $$280   ",
        " this information alone we can multiply (number of hours \u00d7 price per unit) as follows; (180 \u00d7 $1.5). Therefore, Jen earned 270 dollars through normal activities during September while completing all assignments received positive completion bonuses amounting ($10), bringing her grand earnings down to $(270+10=$280.)
