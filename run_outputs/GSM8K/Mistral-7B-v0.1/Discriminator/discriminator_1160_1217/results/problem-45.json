        " miles. Total walking distance required so far: 1+4=5. As Bernie wants all four dogs to take equal walks (on average) across any combination of distances totalling no more than their collective requirement over three rounds; it follows as such this means: ((firstdog)+(seconddog)+x)=((thirddog)+y), or simply put,(1+4+(sum of other combinations)) / 4 . From which we see our goal sum becomes (9+z)/4 , since both 'other combinations' values would always make themselves balancing counterparts when taken together i.e.(summed up value)-[(value being subtracted])/(total sums possible-(difference)), hence z=(solution needed). Also note:(a^m)*n equals n^(cubic rootof m*number )/exponentiatedto cbrt M, meaning cubing takes away another set exponentiation thus resulting into division only operation remaining. Thus solution satisfies its condition whilst also meeting constraints imposed upon itself without violating them either! We obtain Z=(SumOfOtherCombinations); therefore X+=Z ; Where : [TotalRequirementForAllDogs]=NumberPerDay*(RequiredInEachDirectionByEachIndividualDogAverageMultiplier),(Thus MeanValue)^2 / [(Divisor)]-[[Subtrahend]].

Therefore, we calculate `(mileage for dog one + morning plus afternoon+ evening times )` divided by `3`, so it becomes ((1+(4*x))/(3)). Accordingly setting this equation equal to the known avg., we find solution as follows : set `(1+(4*x))/(3)=average)`. This solves further into `'(1+(4*x))= averge * 3' =>  3=(1+(4*X)),'` hence X='(`3`-1)/4'. Substituting values here you get X=`2/4` therefore ,\"the fourth Dog requires,\"=`animal milages walked minus animal milk equivalent*`/`animals totalling up to 3`, meaning `\"0\"` miles (`or no walks`), since all four combined require exactly `three miles.` Which makes perfect sense logically if every individual animal\u2019s exercises meet its expected duration yet still leaves ample space for our remaining pet; i .e ; keeping everyone happy without forcing any extra hard work onto them due only having enough time available!
