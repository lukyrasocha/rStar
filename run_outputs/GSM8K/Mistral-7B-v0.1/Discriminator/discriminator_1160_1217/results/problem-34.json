        " all fourteen (ten plus four) sharks can hold together, using multiplication since you want multiple instances:  120(gallon per single shark)*14sharks=1680.(total). Hence, if every shark holds its normal volume when fully grown up which means their stomach cannot contain twice or thrice its body weight but only about half of this value due to physical constraints like digestion capacity etc., resulting into approximately less than double size compared before consumption even without counting factors such food absorption efficiency changes pre & post meals , what quantity was actually consumed overall during lifetime span ranging back decades ago till recent years ? Therefore although theoretically possible under ideal circumstances described earlier regarding growth potential based purely upon nutrition availability rather practicality/real world scenarios involving numerous complexities making accurate prediction quite challenging especially over extensive periods considering evolutionary biology concepts applied towards specific diet patterns influencing animal longevity rates along varying environmental conditions throughout geological history; however empirical studies conducted within narrower timeframe ranges utilizing statistical models aimed examining population sizes across different regions providing insights related individual organisms survivorship probabilities thereby facilitating further analysis determination trends occurrences frequency distribution among populations residing various habitats possessing distinct feed preferences accordingly informative assessments concerning average lifespan duration implications observed fluctuations correlated resource abundance scarcity directly linked mortality causes affective impact subsequent repercussions extending beyond immediate generational offsprings spanning entire lineages potentially elucidating interconnected mechanisms regulating genetic inheritance governing physiological responses adaptively expressed behavioural modifications consequently modifying social structures inherent attributes characteristically defining species representative representatives particularly notable entities encompass diverse taxonomic categories featuring unique morphological characteristics distinguishing them amongst others occupying similar niche roles functioning symbiotically complementarily interact harmoniously contributing collectively sustaining biodiverse equilibriums crucial maintain stability healthy environment capable supporting varied lifeforms coexisting despite adversarial challenges faced amid constant changing external pressures forcing continuous adaptation ensuring perpetual progress preserving rich intricate natural systems constituting Earth dynamic complexity essential understanding fundamental principles guiding existence ultimately seeking broader appreciation nature marvelously wondrous unfolding narratives revealing profound connections linking past present future illustrating cyclic recurrences underlying continuity unifying"
