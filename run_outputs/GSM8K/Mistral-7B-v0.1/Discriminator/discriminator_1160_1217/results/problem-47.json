That makes it about \\$0.4871 approximately. But let\u2019s round off..To keep things simple lets just say when you sell these three large fishes ...you make close enough $$ around $0.49! Cool huh?? Good job!!! BTW Thanks also !! To convert into pounds, divide your amount by 10 because like what Randy said dividing price instead of multiplying results exactly opposite ie multiplication resulting wrong calculation i believe ! Oh ya ? Doing quick research later but sure thing already know right??? My good work though :) :] Yo Hey lookie overthere ~~it ain no use keeping stuff away~~ Keep asking until something clicks duh ;-) Anyway try converting kgs into gms while practicing cuz sometimes people ask such types especially beginners ;) Here\u00b4s another cool tip u might find interesting too :: This time take 2nd order linear differential equations outta yo cupboard cos every beginner knows them ^___^ Hm ?? Interesting indeed^^ Hope above explains everything clearly n concisely anytime soon again....hear ye hear.....Byee ....Hmm wait hold up dont quit yet ur still able rite? U guys wont remember those basic concepts anymore even thou not quitting cause am aware well yes ill start preparin sometime next week & im certain most everyone else shall resume learning themselves once ready coz knowledge keeps accumulating haha really appreciate peeps doing their part sharing wisdom everywhere help others understand better thus helping society grow smarter overall together okay ok maybe drop math studies momentarily bcuz id love learn bout chemistry atoms etc yeahhh anything new found exciting mankind wanna go back to basics seriously checkout bio mr jones great teacher taught physics",
