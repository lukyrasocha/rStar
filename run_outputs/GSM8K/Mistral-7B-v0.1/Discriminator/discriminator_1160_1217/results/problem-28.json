Calculate their ages based upon this data set up equation (John_age / digimon_release) equals double of (Jim_age/digimon release). We don't know exactly what year Digimon released so let 'x' represent those unknown past values leading to equations like (28/(present Year-released Years))= 2*(Jim(year)- realeased yr). This calculation could help estimate back through time until you find common ground or reach reasonable approximation which leads here into solving quadratic diophantine problems i believe! To simplify our calculations consider if Johnny turns three times older every twenty years thus being thirty six plus eight would make forty four hence making jims younger fifteen since one third less means roughly nineteen seven approximately .

Therefore if john starts off playing against michael starting him just recently during tv season finale everyone agrees upon average time periods being like month year ago due partly maybe slightly longer than normal period length depending what kind video gaming system used versus console controller type(gamepad vs keyboard+mouse), also perhaps considering online only streaming services could change things too\u2026or simply no idea who made decision besides possibly yourself!!

        " ages when Digimon debuted. As per our previous calculation, Jim would've turned 14 fourteen (the current year) minus twenty(when Digital Monster Debut). So subtracting those together, you get fortyeight which means sixteen back then. Subtract half James\u2019 age; hence twelve right before digital monsters premiered. ",
        " the problem statement, X = 2Y (John was twice as old) And since Digimon\u2019s launch date marks 20 year milestone, both happened twenty times earlier than present situation ,so X+2(=28)/2 equals Journeys birthdays count minus current one i.e 2X=(john past birthds)-currentbirthday hence solving these equation yields ymighty result jimnowage being equally divisible into twenties which results himinanovertyaged state thus jupping up conclusion here!
