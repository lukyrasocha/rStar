        " pens so we know it (5) multiplied by 5 equals the quantity or (5*5). This results into 25 red pens; this becomes our first variable(R), which stands for Red Pens. We see next if the number of Black Pen Packs=twice as many(T) as those of red pen paks.. Since R represents twentyfive, multiply these numbers together.(i.e., T=2*r)=2*(5);this simplifies down to tenBlack Pen Paks;Now remembering what the question asked us initially,.the resultant output equation would read something like=(Red+blackpenpack)*numberinaperspereachpack.....This reads:(RedPenPack+(TwiceThatAmount))thenMultiplywithNumberInEachPack...........which ultimately leadsto:[R]+[(T)(5)]=[R]+[T(5)];whereas substituting values yields....we get [R]=[Total Red]=25,(t)+[TB]=total black pen count...,and substitute once again,you finally landupon.[Final",
        " pen packs because we need this information (the initial part mentions both). We know it says that these same amounts as before but doubled; hence identify what operation involves multiplication so you can determine the numbers involved. As stated above 5 blue packets are present while having half which signifies multiplying them i.e., \\( \\frac{5}{2} \\) . This means identifying whether division or subtraction would work here since its implied otherwise within those sentences stating use operations other than addition or dividing already known quantities like multiply. Multiply them together instead using \\(\\left( {5\\times{\\textstyle \\phantom {\\rule{0.222em}{0ex}}}5} \\right)\\), thus resulting into getting ten times fewer items being presented inside said boxes compared against earlier obtained values mentioned initially throughout discussions pertaining towards particular situations concerning color choices made upon certain purchases including instances involving specific brands available during shopping trips taking place across different establishments over varied regions spanning multiple time frames encompassing diverse locations worldwide based solely off facts depicted via written text describing personal interactions occurring among individuals who share similar demographic profiles originating predominantly reside abroad near identical geographic vicinities sharing close social circles whilst engaging themselves recreationally outside one another\u2019s homes primarily located alongside roadways leading directly away further distances thereby making travel easier owning vehicles commonly used every single week without fail due increasing gas prices affect entire population globally regardless location unless specifically specified otherwise explicitly contained anywhere else apart maybe limited scope covering smaller parts only related closely enough either way overall remaining global situation remains basically unchanged besides small portion affected somewhat less severely thanks mostly indirect influence caused mainly through economic consequences stemming heavily influenced greatly indeed often completely dominated financially whereas few exceptions exist occasionally happening rarely nonetheless usually just temporary short term fluctuations lasting max around several months generally followed immediately sooner afterwards nevertheless still significant long terms effects continue longer periods significantly impact largely permanently except possibly locally sometimes quite drastically disproportionately far beyond average expectancies normally expected normal circumstances usual cases typically occur therefore even though rare most certainly wont happen instantly rather quickly gradually eventually likely forever altogether however nonexistent absolutely zero chance whatever happens next definitely won\u00b4t make difference somehow anymore whomever concerned please don$&quot !!!!!!
