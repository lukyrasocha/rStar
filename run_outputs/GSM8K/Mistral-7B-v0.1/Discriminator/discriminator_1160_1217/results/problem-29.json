However we cannot count none as consumed because siblings already claimed their shares even if no apple remained undamaged nor complete due being halved! They collectively devoured every portion imaginable resulting upwards towards our desired integer value thus concluding ultimately; Two brothers completely ingested four portions while Docia nibbled merely single morsel hence totalling together six fractions combined yielding precise culmination worth twelve sectors outlined beneath numerical declaration \u2013 Twelve segments constitutes solution presented herewith forthcoming discourse entitled 'Solution To Mathematical Problem Related Quantifiable Numeric Expression Derivations And Allocations Within Provided Excerpt'.

Their combined count needs to fit within what remains among these three remaining portions as none may account individually exceed it while collectively not surpass twelve.
