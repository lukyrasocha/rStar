This logic carries forward up until the seventh year when a seven-year-old tree quadruples their output becoming four times as productive compared to younger versions resulting in generating 4 * 50 or adding another hundred fruits leading us having reached our cumulative figure thus far of ((2+4) * previous amounts yielding eighty additional fruits overall).

However , if all factors remain unchanged except 'the ninth-year scenario ', which means no new growth takes place within said time frame \u2014 but rather continues upon hitting adulthood instead (for example : having reached maturity already ). Therefore considering things together again yields something similar ; namely such increased output being based exclusively around either half-, doubled,- tripled etc., so long till full saturation occurs prior proceeding beyond into middle stages.. Hence despite seemingly increasingly higher numbers upwards coming along later still maintain certain baseline levels due primarily towards maximum carrying capacity set among young seedlings themselves even though perhaps limited somewhat owing partial compensatory effects available via external resources elsewhere too...
