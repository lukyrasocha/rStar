Well if last time around our initial sum was doubled like 'four times table', well let me tell ya again; multiply what came out before per minute rate factor*time duration. Which translates mathematically into:(previous_sum)*growth_rate*(additional_duration)which turns algebraicaly back once more=(double previous_value)+(quarter extra)!
