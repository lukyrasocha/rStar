        " to create an equation based on words like eight plus or minus (addition or subtraction) which forms part of your sentence structure etc.: Eight more than four times X equals forty translates into an algebraic expression as follows: `four*X+eight=forty`. Convert all terms using base ten numbers (`eight` becomes `8`, `forty` becomes `40`). Therefore you obtain the following simple linear equation:`4*x+8=40`. Next subtract/take away '8' because adding means we want everything else apart form our variable term; thus `-8`: `(4*x)+(-(8))=(40)-8 ===>  4*x=-28 `. Again divide both sides by four(`4`), so if any operation remains same upon dividing either side therefore can simply cancel those out : `[4*(x)]/[4]==[-28]/4 --> =>    x = -7` . ",
        " this amount equals forty (x*4+8=40), you can rewrite as follows: First, subtract eight from both sides so we get;  4X=40-8 ==> 4X=32 -> Divide both side by 4 . Hence our value becomes ; X=8 Which represents what we want Find out whether your solution makes sense check if your derived variable agrees when plugged back into original statement i.e.. Four multiplied thrice(which means three group) plus another one or twenty \u2013 thirtytwo?.
