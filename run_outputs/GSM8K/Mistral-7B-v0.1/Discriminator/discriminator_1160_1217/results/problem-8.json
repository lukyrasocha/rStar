Substituting these relationships into our equation results in this system of equations which can be solved as follows; first calculate Blue Rope according to its relationship with Yellow one using simple algebra like below :   y(BlueRope)=y+7    RedRope=Red*Yellow=(4)(Yellow)+((4)*(-7)) //from above equals ((4)-(-28)))//which means it represents {Red}={Four*(y+7)}=>We already known that their sum is equal to:{Sum} => ({Three})={One}+({Two})+(({Zero}))       or equivalently     37cm=={(four}((y+7){CM})+((y+7){CM})+(yCm))          simplifying yields    37=-3cms/4                         adding '7'' around values you get ==>              Adding up all terms           37='(CombinedLength)'             becomes        '{Sum}'='(Subtotal Ropes Lengths Combined )',                Where           '{CombinedLenth}' stands for Summing them {'Left Over','Difference'} together               while           '[{SubTotal},{Ropes}]' denotes those subvalues before combining/'Adding Up' ('GroupMembers'),{'GatherTogether','Collectively'},they represent ['Them'] whose summation would form the whole set value -->>>>'{[RightSideofEqualsSign]:=[ValueOfWholeSet]}'.

Isolate R first; multiply both sides by 4/(5), so [(4)/(5)] *[37] becomes R=[(4/5)].
