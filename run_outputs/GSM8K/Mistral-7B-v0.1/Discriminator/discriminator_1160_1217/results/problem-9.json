Subsequently subtract this sum divided equally among themselves; i.e., Ronnie would share only about 8 instead off 8. To determine what remained upon having spent such amounts evenly split\u2014or one another rather than keeping all twenty cents together\u2014we get just under sixteen dollars remaining once eighty percent returns back into possession through said transactions.[Also note here if you take away seventy-five point fifty per cent \u2013 seven quarters plus thirty parts whole minus three fifths --you still retain forty pounds sixty four shillings ten pence.] Because most likely fractions wouldn't exist without full numbers being involved hence rounding occurs naturally making wayward discrepancies worth taking account within any calculations involving real life scenarios not math based problems .

As mentioned, when split again equally, only one third remained with Rissa leaving behind about three times less than what belonged to Ronnie means remaining portions being equivalent(x). Equation becomes : Remaining Portion= Total Amount*(fraction retained), thus $(x)$ equals or simplifies down to  $\\frac{4}{5}*$($7.5$) leading up to approximately $6$.

Hence ,the remaining sum held thus far is $15-$11.25=$3.75 .

This equation needs further manipulation via exponent rules applied repeatedly until ultimately yielding simply \u2018X=Y'. As such though all values presented herein accurately reflect mathematical properties inherent within our initial conditions we cannot yet conclude definitively without resolving towards obtainment X based upon Y alone. Nonetheless one could approximate numerical estimation through rudimentary division operations like calculating out every other fractional portion individually starting off assuming uniform distribution among multiple parties thus arrivings near close approximations relative accuracy vis versa precision depending greatly heavily hugely extensibly influenced largely directly strongly significantly proportionate massically substantially related primarily proportionality mostly almost entirely intimately intricately extremely closely highly somewhat approximately very nearly essentially pretty sort exactly comparable kind regarding rather quite fundamentally basically accordingly practically also broadly similarly however generally theoretically most probably plausibly likely maybe still possibly definitely seemingly actually potentially reasonably feasible fairly consistently moderately precisely moreover roughly cautiously sensibly just sufficiently indeed albeit loosely vaguely relatively about equally virtually indistinguishably truly honestly truthfully slightly ambiguously modest unmistakably minimally barely merely marginally scantly scarcely hardly not even remotely suspiciously dubious certainly doubtful noncommittedly hesitantly tentatively uncertain intermittently infrequently occasionally lightly irregularly oddly subtly shy winkling uneasily faintly vague feebly insufficiently scarce lackadaisical slackily sluggish haphazard fluctuate erratically randomness erratic capricious inconsistent wobbly fuzzy undetermined",
        " their little sister; let\u2019s call this common sum X. It also states that afterwards, Rissa retained only four fifths (or 'four parts out of') what remained after distributing funds amongst herself and Ronnie \u2013 which implies three quarters ($C$) remain following distribution to her sibling when compared against original allocation\u2014$X=$\\frac{3}{4}(($\\text{$r\" or $. To determine the value representing one part --their equivalent contribution-- we can divide Rissa's postdistribution remainder using denominators provided within fractional expression above... i.e.: $\\frac{\\dfrac{3}{\\cdot} {\\cdot }(\\text{postDistribution Remainder})}{\\mathrm \\phantom {} .}= (\\mathrm \\phantom {.} .)$ As such if we substitute respective values yielding:$X=$=\\large \\displaystyle $$[\\dfrac{3/\\cdot \\,}{.}=\\Large \\] We learn through solving these expressions:$$X==\\,$ $\\dfrac{3}{\\left( {\\dfrac{4}{5}-\\left({-\\frac {2 }{ 5 }} \\right) }\\right)}$ ...we may recognize those fractions signifying residual quantities belonging respectively to individual participants pre&nbsp;&nbsp;\"equal division\".

        " her sibling because it mentioned every one shared equally. Determine what part of Rissa\u2019s remaining money we need before solving who owns this portion; identify which parts of Rissa or Ronnie remained since it asked about both amounts together but only referred directly to whatever happened specifically to Rissa (left with four fifths). Let 'x' represent the common fractional share deducted. Calculate how much remains if such proportion equals when subtracted from original sum ($15): 4/5*$[$15-$(common_share)]=$[$15-(($15 / [4+1])*1)]. Solving inside bracket first simplifies: ((15/(4+1))*1)=((15/5)*1)=(3), meaning three quarters equaled removed cash. Subtracting leaves us with just over half her stash untouched: $[$15 -(($15 / [(4+1)/[(3*(1/4)+1))]])]=[$15 - (15)-([1]*(1/4)))]=[$15 - 15= $0.] Therefore no funds remain once combinedly assessed, hence nil leftover altogether!
