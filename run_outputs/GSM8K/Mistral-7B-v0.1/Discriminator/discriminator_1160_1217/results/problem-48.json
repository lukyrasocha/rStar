        " sold them individually (not bundled), we know it makes sense to treat this as division into individual items instead of groups or sets because these problems usually ask about cost based on quantities like packages. We can divide up both sides accordingly using cross multiplication resulting in X / (X+Y) = CM/$ . Solving results in 8(CM)/[11] , which comes out to being approximately  76$ cents plus something extra called interest perhaps due to additional expenses such ass taxes etc since no information was provided regarding discount offers hence assuming standard practices apply here also not taking anything else except mentioned sale prices under consideration thus coming down essentially almost exactly matching initial amount spent meaning virtually zero gains overall without specifying further parameters surrounding business transactions especially market factors influencing consumer demand pricing regulations complying standards applied overhead rates involved operational efficiency margins impacting profits made strategies adopted ensuring product differentiation attractive features competitive position maintained maximizing sales volumes generating revenue growth while sustaining value creation optimizing performance benchmark setting guidelines defining best practice adherence promoting excellence fostering innovation driving progress contributing towards holistic development enhancing stakeholder satisfaction yielding positive financial returns establishing long term success paving way forward securing future prosperity investments safeguarding interests creating durable wealth accumulation potential providing stability amidst volatility strengthening resilience mitigating risks capital preservation building portfolio diversification reinforcement risk allocation optimization reward sharing encouraging fair distribution equitable accessibility broadens participation scope amplifies reach effectuating multiplier effects facilitating synergistic benefits propel acceleration momentum advancement elevate status empower transformation spark creativity ignite passions fuel ambition unleash energy harness drive motivate action achieve goals realise dreams conquer challenges surmount obstacles overcome adversities celebrate victories cherish accomplishments savour sweet taste triumph overcoming odds prevail despite setbacks defy gravity climb mountain scale height summit peak soaring higher beyond limits transcend barriers breaking through ceilings shatter glass window frame walls fall back rise again relentless determination persistence courage bravery heroism integrity ethics justice principles honesty trustworthiness accountability responsibility stewardship guardianship caretaking management operations logistics supply chain procurement inventory control quality checks inspections audits records keeping documentation reporting processes systemisation streamlining",

Hence , let me rephrase my previous remarks regarding why would our answers seem wrong ? Multiplying values represents **scaling up something bigger or smaller whereas addition implies combining things together which just sums everything else without scaling anything... And remember folks whenever working through fractional calculations always keep track their meaning behind being parts / portions instead getting caught up too busy doing computations themselves.. First off notice here scaled prices don\u00b4t work well unless using decimals because these represent percentages divided evenly across various items henceforth requiring further adjustments later due lack consistency during those operations!! Which means adding numbers becomes useless until such time scales become possible otherwise remain constant within limits set forth initially ; thus proving essential concepts related ratios matter greatly over mere numerical manipulation alone ... Also take note any attempt change quantities apart form proper proportional changes leads us right back onto confusing grounds quickly enough thereby invalidating majority results produced sole far away ideas .. As conclusion therefore one learns quite crucial lesson learning mathematics often requires careful observation along side understanding underlying principles governing certain situations before commencing new approaches especially while dealing complex scenarios involving multiple factors coming under play simultaneously influencing decision making process heavily impact upon outcome derived ~~simply put knowing basics first helps navigate easier roads forward eventually arriving hopefully satisfactory conclusions finally !!

        " magazine ($72) times one (the original whole). Next multiply this quantity(one or 1 )times eight over eleven , which was three parts out of ten because seven twelfths minus fourteen twentyfourth equals seventeen fiftieths . Convert your improper fraction into a decimal using long division method. Your remainder becomes part of your next digit. When you complete your calculation convert back our value inside parentheses as it represents cents per dollar; therefore if we find out the rate here\u2019s how I calculate : First identify denominator and numerator within fractions above ; my resultant equation looks like followings:- One hundred twelve divided by fifteen equals percentage equal sixty six point one percent so remember when buying something wholesale retailers always mark up sales goods but don \u2019t buy anything unless discount less than forty-sixpointeightpercent off means better bargain ! Also make note about margins before making any purchase regardless type whether online business marketplaces sell physical products only shoppable items such social media platforms offer digital good services mainly videos livestreaming entertainment content streaming channels etc all involve revenue sharing agreements known commonly trade credit financing arrangements used amongst merchants worldwide hence understanding financial systems works well especially relatable terms specific industries interest rates pricing structures economic principles general economics history laws legislation taxes regulations policies international relationships political party affiliations campaign organizations news stories headlines daily newspaper sections current events weeklies biweekly monthlies annual reports books journals periodical publications websites blogs podcast interviews tv programs radio shows music albums songs lyric sheets lyrics musical performances live concert record albums soundtracks movie scripts short films documentaries fiction nonfiction essays poems letters personal correspondence memoir travelogues autobiographies guidebooks dictionaries encyclopedias textbooks novels historical accounts research papers academic articles literary reviews professional opinions editorial opinion columns commentary book reviews critiques evaluations analysis theories concepts conclusions experiments results procedures methods observations measurements data collection techniques information processing algorithms computer software tools applications programming languages coding frameworks libraries documentation protocol standards guidelines recommendations best practices standard operating procedure rules policies codes conventions customs traditions belief system religious faith philosophic school tradition ethical values moral judgment human behavior emotional intelligence creativity inspiration innovation artistic expression science technological advancement medical knowledge healthcare provision diagnostic imaging radiology surgery pharmacy chemistry biochemistry",
        " (11/8) times $72 equals ($). To calculate this mathematically, multiply $72 by ((11)/(8)), or simplify it as follows [(($72*11))/(8)] which comes out equaling $(]. Simplifying further yields $ninety$ [$(=$] as her sale amount per magazine if we consider 'each'. Since no unit quantity was specified initially; thus one would assume only single units sold here making '$ninety' refer solely to the monetary worth received when all articles are offloaded without factoring possible additional expenses such taxes etc., into account \u2013 therefore not necessarily indicating pure dollar gain but rather retail value extracted upon market exit based purely on transaction parameters alone!
