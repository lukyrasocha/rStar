Each half (of an hour) loses him twice this rate or instead gains zero because no new ones replace them once these lose their shape as 'melt'. Therefore, effectively within any specific time frame, Jay\u2019s net increase remains constant which equals 20 minus losses due during production. As stated above loss equates only for those manufactured so while calculating gaining lesser results isn't justified; hence calculate increment based purely upon creation rates leading us towards creating all required units without considering diminishment until complete formation allows assessment against accumulation goals herein presented being \u201860 Snowball targets.\u2019 Hence starting off calculation sequence looks like below snippet \u2013 if X=hours needed yet Y denotes desired outcome target i.e., count/target(C), equation translates into Cx=(X*rate_per_hour)-noelters+straylings).

        " hours needed without considering melting rate yet. Without knowing when any snowball would start/stop being affected by freezing temperature (or not), we calculate as if all made useable instantly; therefore dividing required quantity over created quantities per time period yields this result -- divide 60 desired snowball count / 20 counted per hour = 3 hours initially assumed necessary under perfect conditions.) Calculate actual building process adjusting accounting rates of produced against reduced ones. We know one doesn't last so calculating based off real life average durability factor becomes relevant here ; since two frozen during fifteen minute mark happen twice within our set span thusly implying overall loss due lessened effectiveness(i.e., subtractively removing their combined worth cumulatively) affect both initial productivity & future estimations--a necessity upon consideration!

However you could divide this into small steps if desired like : First find when just ten additional snowballs need made( i.e. subtracting initial count).

Next since any interval doesn\u2019t lose its entirety while melting add back only two nineteenth losses.(Since original plan was also reducing loss/time) .Finally multiply both results obtaining roughly quarter minus eleven fifths period which equivlent close enough value using common denominator method ,giving slightly less time than expected due roundings involved during calculations...

Therefore, subtracting half the rate he makes them \u2013 since not all produced snowballs would remain over time due to the fact that they don\u2019t last forever \u2014 determines effective output per unit timeline i.e. effectively only producing about \u2018one whole plus half another.\u2019 Hence you deduce roughly 20/2=**10 snowballs made per hour.

Since 2 melts during these times, or rather as such since only fractional time gets passed when considering this context, you could just add them up until they counteract into fewer than zero; i.e.,  1st ten seconds -> no change, second increment (-2+0.3)= -1.63 , third increment(-1.63+0.3)= -1.33 , forth decrement=-1.33+(0.3*2)/2 (= -0.98 ; rounded off here because decimals would represent parts less significant hence pointless anyway); fifth iteration:=round(( -0.98)+(.5))=. ~0 => still increasing due to rounding while mathematically actually stopping below Zero value.\r\rSo yes eventually its likely enough .

This would mean about four complete iterations occurred during these six seconds because if you multiply .33 rounded off times 3 ,you get almost equal as half(half=round down).So without melting considerable time frame enough needs accumulate till reaching desired target. One iteration equals roughly ten second intervals when considering all variables considered here; thus adding another couple cycles may also add several units towards our goal although eventually diminishing somewhat depending upon rate versus amount being gained over any specific period\u2026but essentially getting closer! Therefore working backwards through jays process helps us understand better why its taking longer rather than shorter amounts etc.. Essentially factoring out most likely relevant events yields something like below:-Having built initially near zero using normal conditions while keeping above average productivity levels,-Overall estimated net gain increases significantly once certain factors come into play such perhaps wind speed affectin ingredients materials usage patterns)-Even allowing slight reductions due mainly having additional weight bearing effects causing higher stress across various areas.-This could either directly contribute positively helping maintain integrity albeit negatively slowdown creation slightly increasing cycle requirements justifying extra effort required along way forward still seeing great progress compared previous estimates prior calculations...Thus despite initial slower pace appearing possibly quicker ultimately seems reasonable based available data present regarding said dynamics involved even though exact precise values cannot yet pinpoint exactly optimal outcome under varying circumstances....

Oh oh! Here comes yet another twist:) What happens once all existing pairs form stable bondings?? That indeed changes dynamics significantly because bonds might strengthen overtime resulting less frequent losses against natural factors such as cold weather causing them unstable hence needing additional checks(even reconsideration)for overall efficiency measurement thereby providing better insight into real situation scenarios..

Solving this , you\u2019ll find out \u2018t \u2019 equals about three quarters of 4 hours which converts into around half an hour approximately when rounding off figures involved(to keep things simple).
