Given these calculations, determine the amount of those without any striping as follows using subtraction operation first part minus second part equation |(Total Number of Fish)-Red Striped Fish| equals no striped fish count =|(66)-(22)|which results into  44 non-striped fish Calculate the quantity among them possessing blue stripes through multiplication operator considering just portion having it multiply this figure with fraction representing proportion showing off occurrence frequency ratio namely resultant value obtained when performing division process [Blue Streaked Fish]=((Fraction Having Blue Stripe)/Totals Without Red Strikes)= ((5/11))*44 Resultantly coming up with precisely calculated volume equal to (Numerator*Denominator)/Denominator=(5*44)/11 thereby arriving upon summed aggregate equalling exactly twenty four entities bearing said coloration Compute cumulative assembly including both types exhibiting marked patterns Sum combining initially found groups holding either particular markings thus achieved totality expressible numerical equivalent derived via summation technique yielded conclusion herewith acknowledged aggregated measure being collective existence amassment represented by arithmetic addition proceedure consequent outcome realized manifestly observed numerically articulated henceforth presented explicit quantitative descriptor indicating comprehensive collection inclusively encompassing subjects embodying differentiable phenotypical distinctiveness specifically characterized within mentioned prior qualifiers Final ",

        " remaining fish (fish without the one third which was removed) have blue stripes. Let\u2019s start solving it according to these conditions; as per firstly mentioned let\u2019s find out amount or count of red striped ones so calculate half of original batch(ie., 66 / 3); this results into=22redStripedFishInOriginalTankNow we need to get another information about second part i.e.: We know only (1 \u2013 fraction having Red Stripe)(i .e.; Total FishNumber\u2013fractionOfRedStripedOnes), so next we take away all those redstripped numbers & subtract them from OriginalTotalCountThis shall result into new RemainderAmountForSecondPartHere you can see :remainingBatch=(originalbatchnumber\u2212halfwayNumbers)=totalnumbersofFishesRemaining=66\u201322thisResultsintonewResidualCountAfterSubtractingHalfwaysNumbersNewFirstConditionalValueFromOriginAlphabeticallyWe also stated above Condition TwoAs far As Understanding goes&nbsp;&ndash;thereareonlythosewithBlueStripesThatMakeUpFifthAnnDividedByEleventhSo here lets put both values together By using simple ArithmeticRuleWithJustAStringFormatToSeeWhetherResultMeetsConditionThirdCriteriaAccording To Both ParticularConditionsYou Can Check HereCalculationIs Done And Final Result Is::",
        " groups according to their colors using math calculations based on conditions (condition 1; condition 2). Calculate the amount of one group as follows:   NumberOfFish_WithRedStripes=TotalNumberofFish*RatioForOneGroupByConditionTwo / ConditionThree . Therefore , we get : NumberOfFish_withRedStripes = (66 Fish) *( 1/3 )/( 1+ 5/11) = 22 Red Strip Fish ; calculate the second quantity similarly but use other ratio value found above instead of initial TotalNumberofFish parameter: RatioValueFromAboveSubstitutedIntoFirstQuantityCalculationUsingOriginalFormula= (22); Second Group QuantityResult = 5/11*(Conditionsone+(Secondgroupquantityresult)); hence it equals about fifteen or sixteen striped fish depending if you round down vs up. Combine both quantities together to find out all kinds totals here because this represents combination values combined under single entity called 'AllStriped'. You don't add them separately since combinations would lead wrong results otherwise due different types exist thus making calculation irrelevant! AllStripedTotalCount=(NumberOfFishwithRedStripes)+((conditionsthree)/Conditionstwo)*NumbersFishWithBlueStripes As calculated earlier around ten being our best guess within range limits provided set forth initially problem statement... Thus concludes solution process aiming precision yet acknowledging potential variance margin which could further refine result estimates once applied real world contextual scenarios potentially influencing overall outcome accuracy..
