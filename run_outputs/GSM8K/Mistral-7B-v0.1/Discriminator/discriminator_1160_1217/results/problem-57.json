Since we know Pauline visited every other month while continuing going regularly like earlier when no changes occurred, over the course of 5 additional months (since those came directly following initial term), which equals exactly halfway through a full yearly cycle so simply halving annual costs would apply twice ((original)/number_of_months); however since the question asks specifically about amount paid overall \u2013 including prior payments made without raising prices due diligence dictates using our newly derived pricing figure instead, hence doubling such quarter mark expenditure totaled sum equated yieldingly resulting thereby establishing consequent cash disbursements accordingly quantified under fresh monetary constraints applied therefore implicated thus concluding conclusively elucidated summation being precisely rendered mathematically exhibited belowwithforewindsightpropositionhereinafterhintsimplifyingtherequationsunderreviewpresumptuouslyheremakingassumptionsbaseduponobservationalfindingsaccordingtoparametersestablishedpreviouslyperusefullyappliedsubsequentlyconcernedlycalculatableamountsthatpaulinedulyconsistentisquantitativelyexpressedsummedacutelyasapertitudereflectivepracticaldeliberationunboundedideologicalopennessprinciplesembracedeepethoughtfulcontemplativerealitiesinteractiblemodelementarilytiedmathematicalrelativismimplementalgorithmseffectivelyengagedintellectualendeavorsmuchprogresspossiblypotentiallythankscientificmethodensuingprecisefairnessadvantageprovidinginsightsvaluablesurpassescommonknowledgeexpensiveresearchempiricalsourcessubstantiatedfactuallyreproducibilitytransparencyaccountabilityresponsibilityverifiableandverifyableoutcomevalidationevidencecompetingargumentsalternativeperspectivescomparatorivalencesoftencontradictionscritiquedevaluatedcorrectnesscredibleconfirmationscalibrefoundationenlighteninghumblecurios",

Each trip still carried weightage of their older value i.e., about $2 since only future prices matter post January fifth Year Marking Period. Therefore, multiplying old values into tripled frequency spanning full duration yields (2*visit_rate)*(cost_period)*total_years equating approximately ((2*12)(X+Y)/2) considering X=initial rate & Y=five years worth).
