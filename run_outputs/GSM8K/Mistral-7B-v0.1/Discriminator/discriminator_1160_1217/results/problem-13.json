        " initial information provided. To find out how many pods we get per dollar, divide the amount of pods (100) by their cost ($12): This provides us with approximately 8.33 pods/dollar when rounded off . Since it asks about running multiple washing operations with these units within our budget , let\u2019s multiply this value with another factor related mentioned in the question which says a larger pack contains twenty percent(or 0.2x times as often )more units hence requiring recalculation : Multiply first instance results (- approx.8.33 unit/$.$X1),with second one(- approx.(1+0.2)=  1.2.). Do so until achieving result around hundred (since its specified). As such; By doing above calculation ((approximately))we reach into round figure close but below than needed ; thus multiplying again((approx.)*($=~$10))$Y=$ nearest ten near required would mean further iteration till exact values identified,(nearest even tens without fractions or decimals $(~$)yield next stage calculations..This yields:($($$*$ ~)$Z=$ approximate quantity found)(to establish precise count); finally apply whole division process onceagain.$(\\dfrac{total \\, pods\\;\\!}{pod\\,per\\;cycle})$this leads towards desired outcome via accurate approximation ensuring no needless wasteage during computation.; At conclusion-$ $\\displaystyle \\underset{\\Delta X}{\\mathrm {gaps}}^{\\circ}$are minimized yieldingsound estimate reflectiveofintended goal&outcomebasedoninput data & assumptionsstatedthereinwhile adherensto underlying mathematical principlesusedforproblemsolvingpurposehereandthenceaccuracyensuredamidmathematicalanalysisdonehitheretowhich alignsspecific requirementsassertsundercurrentpretextprovidingavaluableoverviewhighlighttingprecisiondemandsentitiesengagedinthemanialprocesstargetingidentifiableobjectivesviacorrectmeasurementprocedurethat upholds integrityoftheinformationpresentedwithoutnosinglackcautionnorunexpectedmisinterpretationspossiblyleadingtowards unintentionalconsequencesimpactinfinalresultsaccordancetothoseexpectanciesassociatedtheremainsatisfiedwithachievedstateassummingeveryvariableconsideredaomultiplefoldcheckintoaverycriticalparticularcontextnamelyp",

We know everything else just like before but changing our units slightly because we need them all as fractions rather than decimals which makes things easier when doing math problems! And also don't forget about those extra 'percentage points'. They actually represent different values here compared back home too (as seen above). But still workable though since these differences aren't significant enough otherwise.. It seems weird indeed right?? Well ok well maybe not quite yet--maybe once someone explains me why exactly percentages mean something completely opposite according no context other cases/applications etc....but wait till later.....Anyway onto division calculations I guess!!! :D First up lets figure uh yes divide both denominators into thirds instead ????
