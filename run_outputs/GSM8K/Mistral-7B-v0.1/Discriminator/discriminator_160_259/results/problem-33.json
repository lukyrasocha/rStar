We first take half which leaves us with _x_= 18*0.5 or _x_= 9 because they removed just over a third i.e., approximately ~~(2/3)___ instead~~___. From here we can see that roughly three quarters remain (_y_) but since exactly seven aren\u2019t specified as \u2018painted,' let\u2019s assume all eight would match their original color leaving _z_ equaling eighteen; similarly adding eighteen again totals thirty-six (thirty flat minus twelve mismatches). What remains unaltered however represents only single group composition so when summed within itself becomes doubled compared against its alterated brethren \u2013 thus ending our tale twentyfourfold greater amount!

From here evaluate how our subtraction operations would affect the quantity if removed altogether as follows; removing first term (i.e., sixth operation performed) leads to sixty being obtained leaving only eighteen birds pertaining to later addition hence forty eight when both terms involved including second mentioned removal proceedings involving twelve animals previously identified within data provided yield conclusion reflective outcome amount corresponding specifically to said inquiry made upon presented information supplied containing numerical entities specified under prior conditions elucidated thereby resulting therefore required calculation necessitated thus accordingly executing such actionable requisitions entail subsequent quantification process rendering specific resolution consequentially deducible whilst adherent compliance mandated regarding established criteria inherently stipulated intrinsically contained otherwise implicit contextual parameters dictated encompassingly contemplated comprehensively considering overarching ramifications implicitly underlying interconnected relationships implied subtly insinuated covertly conjectured discernible yet abstractedly hypothesized surmised presupposed assumed tentatively inferred plausibly perceived speculatively suggested postulate theoretically proposed assumption unsubstantiated hypothesis validated verifiable corroborative confirmation substantiated empirical validation testimonial affirmance attested acknowledged evidenced factually vetted conclusively authenticate establish credibility fortifying assurance guarantee security ensure dependability maintain accountability uphold responsibility protect safeguard secure guardian defend champion advocate represent assert claim justify warrant cite reference quote authority validate legitimize authoritative source verify documental evidence present indisputable proof admit testimony qualifiy statement ratify approve concur grant consent agree settle dispute resolve conflict mediate reconcile harmonize balance reach consensus achieve agreement find concurrence discover common ground determine solution identify problem solve devise innovate invent design engineer create construct build manufacture craft assemble fit install repair fix troubleshoot diagnose remedy recover rehabilitate resuscitate revive rescue salvage recycle reuse repurpose regenerate renew restore sustain support strengthen bolster solidify empower enhance improve upgrade develop advance progress promote catalyze acceler",

Next calculate those changes through consecutive mornings as mentioned in story. First change occurred when half (one third) was removed which means remaining amount would be original minus what is taken away/half i.e., `remaining_flamingos=initial flamingos*[number not removed]/(total)/(original quantity)=18*(2/3) (=36 / 6)` Which simplifies into six less than double the initial count equals twelve `(removing \u2154 equates taking care off three layers so remove second layer leaving only top most portion)`. Hence first removal decreases flameingo numbers making them become equal since both sides add same but opposite signs amounts ie; positive decrease became negative increase.`Final state` therefore consists of previous base plus addition resulting equivalent totals due equivalence conditions set forth eg(`Base+Addition eq`) hence outcome being zero if none else remains absent thus creating absence imbalance (`final difference becomes Zero`).
