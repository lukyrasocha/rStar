Next identify another operation/process required besides just peeling; here we know Bobby needs also 'cut them'. Determine the average time per process requirement(peeling+ cutting). Since Peeling requires double as longer than cutting according information provided hence taking around ~90 second means Cutting part should require significantly lesser i.e., Around 30 Seconds which matches our observation correctly . Subtract your calculation derived above regarding pure 'Cutting task\u2019 costing merely 60 Potato_no*(Time_per_Potato)= <<60*((1*60)*5)/60= 5>> hours & add calculated earlier result based upon sole peeling action mentioned ,which results into Final ",

However we also know it takes him less than a second per potato when actually chopping/cutting them; exactly specified as taking around 5seconds(about). Thus multiplying 60*5 yields another quantity representing those additional seconds used just for slicing which equals 300 seconds in total. Subtract these values together because Billy can\u2019t spend longer choosing whether or not to slice before putting away what he already finished dicing first off since both activities happen simultaneously once complete respectively during our calculation phase thus ending up reducing overall processing duration down accordingly.

Next calculate the time needed to cut up those 60 potatoes into small even squares/cubes since this process can also happen simultaneously as he continues to peel new ones. To compute this we use the fact that taking out any n^th power root when raising both sides exponents equal implies you multiply their bases. This means if 2^(t/n)=m; i.e., m grows double every unit of time 't'. Our example yields thus ((yield_time)/(cutting rate))=((minutes)*log base sqrt(2)(total yield/rate)). That works because our operation allows us to find reciprocal operations such like multiplication divided by logarithmic transformation back to linear space while preserving ratio across whole group undergoing simultaneous processes allowing faster growth rates than conventional division approach.

        " already peeled potatoes into fourths. As it takes around 5 seconds (which equates to approximately .083 hours) to cut them once, doing this process four times per potato amounts to .083 \u00d7 4 or about ~.33 hours/potato. Multiply the estimated cutup timing (.33 hours / potato) by 60 potatoes ((.33 hours / potato) X 60 potatoes=~19.8 hours). Finally add both processes together! Hence 90 minutes (peeling alone; approx. 1.5 hours)=+approx.~19.8(cutting)/hour*total=~19.8\u00d71.5=29.7hours\u2248Total Processing Time\u2192Totalsuperimpose Together->202.5 hrs =~or equivalently just under 6 days.

Add together these times, i.e., Peeling Time plus Cutting Up Time equals Total Prep Time needed; which comes out to be 90 minutes (or 1 hour and 30 mins.) + 5 Minutes=Total prep TIME being '1Hours_and__Mins'.

Therefore, if we convert this into hours and remaining minutes \u2013 since there are 60 minutes in an hour\u2013 it comes out as around 1 hour and 35 mins exactly. But considering 'minute precision', you might round down any partial hours/mins when doing such calculations due to real world practice constraints; hence your original computation stands correct as well without further breaking down additional minutes apart already obtained during whole hour conversion process itself!

        " minutes to peel all 60 potatoes. This equals 60 * 1.5 = 90 minutes just to peel them. Each potato also takes about 5 seconds to cut up which would equal 60*5 seconds or 300 seconds. To convert this into minutes we divide by 60 (since there are sixty seconds in a minute) yielding 300/60 = 5 additional minutes spent chopping the vegetables. Thus overall, considering both actions taking place simultaneously as part of prep work means adding times together resulting in 90+5=95 minutes needed.
