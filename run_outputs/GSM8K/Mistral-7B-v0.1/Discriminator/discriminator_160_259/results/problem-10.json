        " hat, calculate its price like this :  25(c=jacket)x3->$75 (cost of one jacket). Next find out what the pair consists of together ($75+$25=$100), because we need their mean value which amounts to half($100/2)$. Finally ,add all these items up; you get:$25+$75+$50=$150 Total Cost. The answer is: 150.",

This result tells us that this would indeed lie exactly midpointly so when one computes $(25)+75$, he/she automatically arrives at twice the value already found above without directly calculating it. Hence add these results together to get $75+$25 equal to $100$: this amount needs to finally split evenly across both items since we computed its average beforehand; hence divide all equally into pairs such as shown below: $$\\frac{\\left(\\begin{array}{l}2\\times25\\\\ \\\\  2\\times75 \\end{array}\\right)}{\\left\\{2\\xrightarrow{divide\\;each\\,\\text{pair}\\,of\\,the\\;\\sum}(75)\\right\\} }$$ $$=\\frac{{2\\times25}+{2\\times75}}{100}=\\frac{50}{2}= \\$25.$$ Thus adding up everything leads back againto the same price previously assigned per pair thus showing consistency here..
