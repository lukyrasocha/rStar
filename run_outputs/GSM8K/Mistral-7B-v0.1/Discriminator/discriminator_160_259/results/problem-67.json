With upgrading his meal further for additional costs ($3.00), this raised his overall expense up till becoming approximately $14.00($11+$3).

Two salsas costed him twenty five cents twice equals fifty cents ,so he owes $10.50+$0.50=$11. His additional upgrades came through spending thirty percent i.e., 0.3$* (his subtotal here)   That means we need first calculate what would come before this charge ;i.e subtracting these fees against our current value of \"$\"(this comes under taxable charges )     It amounts to ($11-$3)=$ 8. This leaves us with a bill of $8 plus he can apply towards using gifts cards worth 5 Dollars $.    Therefore Subtracting all these things $(5)-(8)$ results in $-3$.

Next when upgrading all this was another $3; thus adding yet another 3 bucks to make the current amount 11+3=14$    And lastly if our customer wants chips & a soda as well that comes free once charge goes above/equals ten dollar bills($10); therefore meaning before applying any gifts cards or payment method available ($in this case its a Gift Card) ,the bill would automatically go down below zero making us subtract twenty seven cents off the overall balance hence reducing the initial due till about fourteen three quarters(or twelve six hundred seventy thousandths).
