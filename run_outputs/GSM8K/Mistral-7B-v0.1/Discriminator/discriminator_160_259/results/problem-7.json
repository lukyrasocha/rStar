        " later Using another hint which states that the combined ages of the siblings would increase by four every year), it follows through using mathematical logic reasoning since if B represents brookes current age, seth\u2019s presentage could hence represented by \u201c2B\u201d . Adding further details into this equation , namely time \u2018t+2,\u2019 or plus six months you add onto these figures making them \u201d(2b)T=28\u201c\u2026..solving thusly makes b equal eight meaning therefore that Seth \u2019s current age would come out accordingly at being doubled; twelve yes indeed!

        " this sums up to 28 (meaning both increased their respective ages), we can set it like so : 2x(BrookesAge) + 2+2=28 , thus simplifying to get brookesage equals seven . And since seth is twicetime older than brooks whose age currently stands at 7 meaning eightyfourth year. Therefore the right solution turns out being  8.",
        " both together currently equals (2*Brooke_age) which implies it\u2019s equal to ((2*(CurrentSum-YearAhead))/(TotalPeople), we can therefore write equations based upon these facts. We get :  ",
        " if both get older (which happens when you add 'two'), it means currently one year younger than that; so right now we subtract those extra birthdays yet to happen \u2013 i.e., just before these future events occur. This makes Brooke\u2019s present age roughly equal to fourteen minus twenty which equals negative six... No wait! That doesn't make sense!

        " their ages again before calculating Seth\u2019s present age (twice Brooke\u2019s). Let's denote Seth's age as 'S', which means Brooke's age is half of it; so we write this relation as B=S/2 or rearranging terms becomes S=2B. We know according to problem statement when these people get older two years hence their combined age equals to twenty eight i.e., (S+2) + (B+2) = 28 . Substituting our term derived above into new equation gets us =>(S+2)+((1/2)*S+2)=28 OR simplifying further leads to ((3/2)S + 4 ) = 28 , subtracting  4 off both sides leaves you having .....=> (3/2)S = 24 multiplying through by fraction invokes ... ......->3*S=(24*2)->>>~3*S=====\u21d2>>>= S ======--> >>>---=>========\u2014-- ==> Finally solving last expression provides ~~~~ >>>>>>>>>>---------- -> > ",

It also tells us this combined figure 'in X years', meaning when both parties become older than currently (that time being T \u2013 N or something like P minus N equals Y), totals up to Z; hereafter presented numerologically ((T+N)+(P+N)=Z) becomes clearer because future dates can only be calculated once present figures (current data such as date \u2018X\u2019 plus n units equal resultant prediction denoted through variable letter/number combination.)
