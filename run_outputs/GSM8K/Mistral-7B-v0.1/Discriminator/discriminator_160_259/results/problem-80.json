Use subtraction operation to determine the exact count of extra candy owned by John compared to James. By plugging back our discovered value into original relationship regarding James \u2014i.e., Jamie owns six additional treats\u2014 we find out James has exactly \u2018Robert+sixmore', therefore 27+6 equals precisely thirty three candies. Find the numerical data depicting the surplus quantity present in John relative to James through subtractive process\u2013 so effectively take away or remove the entirety obtained in reference one (thirty three) from all belonging to second party (fifty four).
