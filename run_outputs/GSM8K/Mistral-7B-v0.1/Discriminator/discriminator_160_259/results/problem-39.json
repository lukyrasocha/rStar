Since he edited 1000 sentences this means he worked 1000 / 2 = <<1000/2=500>>500 sentences on one publisher, either A or B. Calculate how much he earned from publishing A using multiplication based off their agreed upon payment structure. His earnings working as Editor (A) can be found via simple division since we know our rates:  1 dollar per cent equals hundredcent; therefore $.05 becomes .05*100c=.5$ When multiplied against quantity of words works out like so (.5d)*(500)=$.25 This process allows us multiply our decimals directly into integers without worrying about changing context through regrouping across decimal points As you see I used \"$\" instead converting every time back intends just because your question uses it but makes no clear distinction if indeed needed At anyrate use all possible relevant info available Findings workout nearly identical when calculating income associated w Publishing Business (B): Market value *.1*$ [all quantities] results similar values Working editorically for business b yields approximately $(2.5k+5)/2=$1250+$250:$<<(0.1*(1000))+(1000*(0.1*1)-(((.01)+(.1)))=(250+1250))>> ($1250+$250)$ That leaves us finding difference between those totals We subtract these findings together:(~)(1250+250)-($(1250+$250)$$ To solve simply combine terms within parentheses first adding resultant whole numbers::$(1500)-(1500)=$$ Result remains zero! Contrary to popular misconception not having additional monetary impact Zero always represents lack of change No matter amount involved Thus while initially appearing complex such problems typically boil down fairly quickly provided proper attention Their complexity stems largely due implications outside original scope But none exist here leaving only accurate solution being exactly 'nothing extra!'",
        " pays 5*2= <<5*2=10>>10 cents per sentence. Next find out how long it takes Mark to edit all those sentences during one workweek if both employers together paid him X cents.

        " (and hence Publisher A), which would be half the total because Mark edits equally for both publications. Thus, Editorship divided evenly across these sources results in \\( \\frac{1000}{2} \\) or 500 sentences being attributed to either business. Therefore, calculate earnings based on this calculation through multiplication; multiplying quantities times price provides the revenue earned over time period considered within problem statement bounds.
