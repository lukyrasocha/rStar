I guess this time we don't need subtraction or addition. Just remember all operations cancel out equally if performed opposite one another within same contextual scenario hence no new information can create change therefore result stays consistent as initial state. That means still considering only starting values here makes most sense without introducing further constraints such changes due perhaps through deletion/installation cycles per session activity history over specific timelines etc.: i.e., maintaining constant variable count until otherwise specified directly altering system parameters (new software installations included).

Therefore adding them back into existing calculation would involve both actions taken together rather than isolation based individually as shown earlier example involving just single action(like 'Deleting unused').
