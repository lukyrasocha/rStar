        " means it would take John (3*60) / 2 = 90/2=45 moments to complete collection all Peaches. Since every moment equals just ONE PEACH , this result says we need only consider UNIT MOMENT FOR THE QUESTION . This results into getting us REAL answers as; john gets exactly FOUR FIFTY CHEESE CORN BROWN! Let me correct my approach : Firstly I realized mistake was miscalculation under term 'moment'. Each hour contains  60minutes(NOT seconds). That makes our first operation different than previously written here.. Correcting above equation thus yields ; Total collected peces equal Time Spent Collecting multiplied By Rate At Which They Are Being Collected.(Each Unit Of time equalling rate.)Thus correctly calculated calculation becomes **TotalPeacesCollected**=(TimeSpendingAtCollection)*RateOfPeachcollection=. Calculated values become :-In Our Case:-Here we know value of both variables which include mentioned parameters hence calculating their multiplication directly follows below formula expression:(A)= (**B***C*) ..where (*here represented Multiplication Symbol*)..Calculated Result thereby yielding desired output namely **totalpechescollected****is->(90pcs).As per question prompt stating 'How Many?' asks about amount therefore rightfully expressed unit shall remain same denoting entirety simply numerical quantity without incorporating any adjectives or qualifiers...
