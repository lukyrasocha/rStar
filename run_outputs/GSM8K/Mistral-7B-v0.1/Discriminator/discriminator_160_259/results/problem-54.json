This answers my question but can someone explain better or show me another way? I really want clarification since you answered correctly yet it\u2019s not what i was looking for . What other ways we could get to this result ? Sure thing! Another method would involve considering rates of change rather than amounts directly due to leakage. Here's one alternative approach: Let S represent the amount of water in the smaller pool initially, so the bigger one holds 2S because it starts off having twice the capacity under normal circumstances without any loss through its hole. When time progresses, let us denote 't' seconds passed. Given their respective flow rates into the environment (draining), our equations become thusly: Bigger Pool Flow Rate (Less Water over Time): -(B)(dt)=-(2S)*(-(4 gal/ min))*((60 s/ minute)/t )=-120St Volume Loss Equation per second.(Small Pool Static State: Not Draining Any Liquids Over Time). Smaller Pool Keep Its Initial Capacity Constant:(S). And according to your narrative within [this problem], these volumes aren't equal anymore post leakage incident--the larger contains fourfold liquid compared to the diminutive counterpart---thus rendering [(2S)-(4gal*(60sec/mintue)*T)]/(4)+[S]~\u2248([FourLargePoolsHugeCapacity]/[(OneTwiceAsMuchWithNoAuditibleWaterFluidizationFromItOverTimeAndGalacticFlow)](OneUnitOfInitialVolume)),where T equates solely when said volume changes\u2014which occurs exclusively upon fluid extraction events transpiring subsequent immediately past event moment.[So using algebra here yields:]=> **Solution**   => Solving Algebraic Problem Through Step-By-Step Method With Alternate Approach    <=     Henceforth derived via initial conditions followed upward linear rate conversion based differential equation theory application results concurring accurately with antecedent solution verifying theoretical model alignment validity regarding specified stipulated temporal sequential condition progression influence extrapolation resulting yield quantitative determination thereby confirmable equivalency corroborated exhibits proof supporting conceptual understanding reinforce critical analysis",
        " means leakage rate was one min^-1 or 1 per minute (it didn\u2019t run during this period), hence when we calculate volume difference remaining it remains true till present time so if old condition said B > S but new says D=B*4(D meaning distance) than obviously original size would also increase which contradictory statement , let us assume amount removed wasn't directly related just remove whole capacity resulting in ration becoming unchanged . As ratio changes remain constant without removal implies capacities equal always no matter what else happening only removing part reduces sizes keeping proportionality intact despite having different initial values unless stated contrary ..thus irrespective other conditions mentioned can never change fact even if initially doubled bigger already contained greater quantity thus every subsequent calculation solely based off changed factor ie loss due draining doesn\u2019t impact our logic here because its effect irrelevant relative comparing against larger unit itself not affecting comparative relationship \u2026here comes key detail !!!
