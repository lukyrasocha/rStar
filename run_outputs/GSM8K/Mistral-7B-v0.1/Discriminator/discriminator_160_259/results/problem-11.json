These calculations serve not just educational purposes but also stimulate curiosity about various biological structures among living organisms especially those belonging under arthropods phylum classification including centipedes,scorpions etc., thereby underscoring scientific interest surrounding such unique life forms encountered daily around us without necessarily requiring extensive lab experiments associated typically linked towards understanding complex genetic modifications exhibited upon exposure certain environmental conditions affective repercussions visible externally only amongst otherwise seemingly similar groups like arachnids classified alongside amphibians & fishes family tree indicating significant evolutionary development stages having occurred over billions years timescale leading mankind till date discoveries advancements made possible owing greatly due research efforts spearheaded academics scientists globally inclusively contributing immensely human welfare enhancement beyond mere speculation limited imagination confined primarily based traditional methods historical observations alone failing completely replace modern computational numerical techniques applied systematically yield accurate predictions benefitting diverse domains alike conservation biodiversity strategic planning climate change mitigation renewable energy sectors transport infrastructure agricultural practices medical treatments vaccines drugs potential medicinal benefits derived naturally occurring compounds thus establishing clear links between multidisciplinary fields fostering integrated approaches promoting innovations driving progress across spheres directly correlated tangible improvements citizens quality lives society sustainability environment preservation global peace stability security public safety overall wellbeing healthcare prevention disease treatment adverse effects side effect relief pain management support emotional mental stress coping mechanisms resilience trauma recovery posttraumatic growth optimistic hope transformational experiences personal empowerment mindset shifts catalyst positive behavioral changes hab",

This time we also want their individual quantities so remember your previous work/steps here as well since these numbers won't change whatsoever while doing such calculations which could save quite some effort especially considering large datasets one might encounter during experiments or simulations involving various types species within diverse habitats across earth depending upon particular parameters being analysed etc., however knowing only basic arithmetic skills alone would suffice even though learning advanced mathematics helps understand certain nuances related scientific computations too :) . Add those totals :  640+540+(3*10)=1,230 Hence ,the first part was wrong !!! We don't need additional operations besides simple addition / subtraction throughout steps provided earlier whereas correct summation involves adding calculated values directly afterwardswithout repeating any already obtained results througout process(or using them elsewhere).
