        " minute; according to what we know so far, Kalinda places about four (or close enough) pieces every minute into the puzzle. Calculate the speed or pace at which her mother works -- since I already read offline your text saying 'Her Mom puts together only half as fast', you would divide Kalinda\u2019s time by two \u2013 hence calculating twenty minutes/hour instead of forty minutes/hour. To solve this question find out how long until both get through their share if everyone finishes up same amount in one hour--it needs multiplied onto three hundred sixty divided past sixteen people altogether just like earlier shown multiplication tables chart above. Add these speeds when put together equals thirty-two times fifty point something plus fifteen points eight ten minus seven sevens oh . Make sure all numbers match exactly even down right side lengthwise before subtracting anything else! Last but not least remember convert units whenever asked within less than seconds whether those measurements involve decimals(?) Or fractions.(easier said). Good luck everybody :) This means They work simultaneously...so Total Time taken= Minimum Of Both Times Calcultetd Earlier.... Hence We Have :Time Taken By Mother=(360)/((32*4)+15)=3Hours Rounded upto Nearest OClock!! ",
        " the puzzle (360) by twice Kallina\u2019s speed because her Mom places only half as fast; i.e., 4/2=2 therefore together both girls work at four people a minutes hence multiply their rates [k*m]=(4+2)=6 . This means combined they can solve six pieces every single second so divide your original amount(360)/their collective pace or efficiency,(i.e.,).6.(practically three hundred sixty divided into groups of six)(in other words find out what would you get when one group consisting of 6 objects gets assigned thirty sixy things.)This yields us ninety. Lastly convert seconds into years knowing standard measure units hold time being twelve months comprised within these periods known commonly called Years while counting upwards through weeks make note again seven tenure segments exist in such cycle also identified using \u201cdays\u201d abbreviated hereafter D since we need larger unit than Hours remembering Standard Measurement Units holds Thirty Six Tiny Timestamps making Eight Periods before reaching another Unit bigger even further yet Known As Century Certain Calculations yield twenty Four Time Slices containing Twelve Nine Point Zero Second Interval Between Two Successions Therefore dividing our previous figure Ninety By Forty eight equals exact division resulting in Equation Bellow..Final ",

This calculates into (360/4)=90 minutes since kalinda adds one piece every .12 or 2 full seconds , but we know that moms speed is only half what kalyndas so calindas works twice as fast therefore halving kalindras time means no needing any calculations here(360/(4/2))=180 minutes But adding both their speeds together actually takes less than what you get when calculating using solely Kalindi\u2019s skillset because doubling rates doesn\u2019t result to actual calculation times being doubled , thus divide overall task among both mother and daughter :calculate remaining amount required divided by combined rate;that becomes remainder value /[kalindez+mothers]ratenegative reason why people love cats",

This suggests no difference exists among choices offered henceboth individuals achieve same goal under optimal conditions assuming full capacity utilization without considering factors such interruptions etc !
