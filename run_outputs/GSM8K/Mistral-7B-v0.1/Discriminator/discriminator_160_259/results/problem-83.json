So far u r good . But why worry abt calculations involving percentages or any fancy math concepts until ur really familiar enough & confident using 'em otherwise risk making mistakes easily instead getting through basic algebra quicker ? Just remember one thing always use common sense whenever dealing situations requiring logic reasoning : keep track off things related specifically TO THE SUBJECT !!! Example below:- To solve problem mentioned earlier try following method :- Calculate value X y based upon variables Y , Z thus reducing possible calculation errors caused especially due misleading results arising indirectly sometimes leading into wrong conclusions ; similarly apply same technique again while answering subsequent ones too :) Note addition operation shown above may help understand idea even simpler :-) BTW also worth noticing adding negative quantities directly subtracts their absolutes ie -(X+Y)=-(X)+(-Y)(see explanation link provided alongside post title ) whereas multiplication preserves sign unless product itself becomes positive hence resulting difference observed commonly seen throughout literature explaining complexities involved behind seemingly simple operations such us division etc..
