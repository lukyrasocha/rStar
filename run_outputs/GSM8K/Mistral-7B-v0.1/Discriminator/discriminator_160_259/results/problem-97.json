        " ate 30% of the redwood\u2019s wood. Since every foot represents another piece of wood weighed separately (due to its uniformity), first calculate what % translates into actual inches since height was provided as 'feet'. This means one unit corresponds to .1 sections which equals 1 ft/section. Convert the percentage taken away due to being consumed by pests using decimal form(%. Use simple division to convert.) Calculate what remains post damage(inches) Weight would come out equivalent if you multiplied the remaining dimensions back together.(ft*sections). Multiply converted loss against original measurement.*Weight per item or section calculated earlier=Final figure ",
