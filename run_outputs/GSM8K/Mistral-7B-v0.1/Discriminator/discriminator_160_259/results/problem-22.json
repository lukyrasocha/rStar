Add two since this represents their situation presently rather than looking two years ahead or behind, making him eighteen overall in terms of his present state not past.

Therefore, I conclude based upon typical maturity milestones observed , it could take time before hitting peak physical health attainment; hence considering this factor may slightly push up Jean\u2019s estimated range closer towards higher twenty seven instead simply adding plus three even though mathematically right \u2013 keeping context important here rather going strictly numbers related..

Notice my notation used throughout includes brackets placed within []to help clarify conditional dependency relationships among variables ; therefore not misconstrue condition implications due logical grouping errors caused via traditional math precedence ordering procedures !!!
