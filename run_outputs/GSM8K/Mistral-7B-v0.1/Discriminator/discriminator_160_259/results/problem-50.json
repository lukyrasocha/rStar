This means all together this week (for the purchase), Sarah earned 20 (from babysitting) plus 4x (mowings). Given that Jackets alone are priced at 30+4*$2=$38($2*each shoe)+$3(jacket)=$41. With current savings, we need $41-$10= $31 additional amount needed over saving account. Overall it required $\\boxed{8}$ extra jobs till Mom pays enough $$$. We solved using substitution method as below : Firstly assuming , let no.of_times_needed_to_mow=(n); Secondly writing our equation which equate both revenue methods;  =>No_extrajob/Totalworkload() ;=> ($\\frac{( \\color[red]{{$}  20 +\\quad n}{\\text{' }})}{{\\text{' }}}$)=\\frac{{Extra\\_revenue}}{${Final}_{cost}}$; Finally putting actual values & solving . By isolation properties applied twice along side substitutibilities made into solvable system i.e.,$\\begin{array}{clll}\\frac{\\textcolor{blue}{( \\$ {    \\\\       {   }{         (\\\\ )}\\\\     \\\\      [ }{&}&[{ }{$$}]} &\\qquad\\;+\\;&quot;and:\\\\=&&\\,\\left.\\;\\dfrac {\\textcolor{black}{[\\ {$]}}{\\text{' '{}}}\\right)^{-1}=\\left\\{\\!\\!,\\\\{}:\\hspace{-0pt}\\,\\&&\\int_{\\mathbf{[}\\,]} \\mathrm{(}^u\\, \\, du)\\end{array}$ Solving above equations , yields us desired value N..

Subtract values obtained above hence $(70 \u2013 54); From our calculations show us that even after working both jobs twice again without forgetting adding previous saving , sara doesn't reach up till target goal! We conclude thus : Given data implies further hardships ahead until full balance hits '$70'. ",

Total earned after babysitting four times equals (number_of_events=babysitings)*(amount_per_event)=($5*4)$=$20$. Add together the initial savings and earnings through both activities so far ($initial_funding+$babysitting_income), which means `$10+20`$, making up $$=$30$. Finally identify remaining funds necessary to reach goal; subtract this summed budgetary current figure ($final_goal-$current$)which yields `(remaining amounts needed)->[total cost-(saved fund)]=[x]`, therefore $[70-$30]=[$40]. Each instance or \u2018lawnmowing\u2018 session generates another ${$4}$. Hence divide resulting difference [cost still required/$amount gained])(`needed divides gained`) meaning `[num sessions=(cash gap divided into gain)/gain]`$(n=%5d)`solves ([calculated num periods](%d)), yielding result `((budget gaps devided against income))(%d);%.f`.
