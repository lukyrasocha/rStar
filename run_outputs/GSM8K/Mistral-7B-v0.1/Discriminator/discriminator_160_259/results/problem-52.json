        " rectangular area measuring X meters \u00d7 Y meters (X stands as placeholders here). We need this information later but aren\u2019t sure yet whether it matters right away or not. Take note however \u2013 one side seems considerably shorter than the other, so we can expect our numbers involving length L to differ significantly from those related to width W, such as if EQ=(LxW)=(1.5\u00d76)square metres=9 square metres; also FH=(\u221aLC)(YR)=(\u00bd\u200byards)(10 feet)+(CBE+FGE){1 meter}=\u2154yd\u00b2+(\u00bcyd\u00b2). This means CBED would measure double its original size since ED was increased twice due being next both sides having lengths greater than halfway through their respective segments. However because CD equals DE regardless what proportion these figures take up within ABCD EFGH , similarly DCE remains constant irrespective upon changes made inside CE itself while still maintaining ratio equality among all four angles throughout geometry principles applied above when defining various points regarding triangles formed accordingly below via intersection lines mentioned earlier whenever applicable depending circumstances dictated specifically case specific factors involved during calculations process performed subsequently based particular requirements specified forthcoming further down shortly discussions held relating topic under review thus far explained prior pertaining issue addressed currently addressing present discourse presented subsequent explanations furnished preceding ones thereby providing clear insight intended audience members likely familiarity topics discussed past history behind concepts utilized explaining why certain steps taken seemingly reasonable considering previous actions undertaken previously stated example illustrated henceforth shown following detailed descriptions provided just moments ago accompanied immediately appearing visually represented diagram included alongside narrative verbal description outlining same principle demonstrated already observed repeated pattern established amongst similar situations encountered repeatedly experienced time intervals spent studying literature available online concerning theories developed recently developing scientific methods employed discoveries made new technologies devised implementing findings derived results obtained using innovative techniques adopted worldwide research conducted continually expanding body sciences encompass global community collectively pursuing knowledge advancement achieved every single minute daily never ceasing striving progress make despite obstacles faced challenges overcome barriers surmounting hurdles overcame finally succeed master skill required practice needed refinement improve abilities strengthen core competencies essential building foundation critical understanding basic principles fundamentals underlying comprehension necessary grasp theory apply methodology effectively conduct experiments evaluate data analyze conclusions interpret significance meaningful insights garner wisdom accumulated wealth gains acquired capitalize",
        "\u2019s dimensions are 1.5miles long by 6 miles wide. To calculate length= perimeter; P=(n+2)a so (perpendicular sides)=(P)/(parallel sides). Substitute known values into equation. Periphery calculation: [(2*1.5)+(2*6)] or [3]+[12] equaling 15 . We know time equals distance divided by speed using units we can substitute numbers directly as follows Time required : Distance walked (meters or km / Speed)(hours), this means divide m by kps. As you see dividing meters (or kilometers!) by kilometer hrs it results us unitless quantity called \u201ctime\u201d here its not really needed but helps get rid off dimensional analysis stuff. Multiplying them together gets actual value without extra work ! Here doing multiplication doesn \u2018t actually mean multiplying these terms ; I used division only since one factor was already computed , hence leaving me just needing product over quotient i obtained previously earlier mentioned formula simplified enough avoiding further simplification process making math easy even easier enjoyable learning both interesting facts helpful applications real life use cases scenarios everyday experiences too sometimes practical situations solved quickly efficiently solving problems practically rather than theoretically academic theory nevermind getting answers correct right wrong whichever way matters most important thing always applies learn well understand concepts deeply master skills useful tools knowledge essential ingredients towards success achieving goals reaching targets setting sights focus drive ambition purpose direction motivation energy passion determination tenacity grit persistence resilience character strength courage bravery leadership qualities integrity honesty trustworthy relationships meaningful friendships family loved ones relatives extended kinship networking community connection social interactions human bonds empathetic compassionate caring kindness generosity charitable deeds philanthropy acts altruism benevolent behaviors selfless service volunteering donations help contribute society improve living conditions enhance quality lives betterment societal welfare public good overall commonweal global brotherhood world citizens shared responsibility collective action cooperation collaboration partnership solidarity unity harmony peace fraternity fellowshiptogether creating utopian idealistic vision hope optimism future prospect possibilities opportunities potential benefits reward positive outcomes happy ending happiest result best possible outcome worst case scenario disaster catastrophe tragedy calamity misfortune bad luck unfortunate circumstances unhappy situation sadden occasion sorrow heartache",
        " third condition. This means you need to calculate perimeter (P) using P=2(l+w). Here we know 'l'=(long side)=6 miles; w=(wide side)=1.5 mile. Calculate length :   P=2*(6+1.5); thus ,    P=2*7.5 ;     Therefore , p=15. Hence it takes him . i.e., time required=distance / speed = distance covered / rate as formula implies here since both distances measured same units so can divide easily hence          Time needed                             or      T=d/v         =>       T               ---->            =============>        T           Speed              Distance             Or equivalently,(because our measurements all converted into mph ),we would also use unit conversion factors.(note this isn\u2019t necessary mathematically but helps us understand what happens when we plug everything back together.)or simply put,time spentwalking equals walked divided through speedspeededividedthroughspeedmeasuresper hourinhoursthereforeTimeSpentWalking                DivideBothNumeratorAndDenominatorByMilesSpeedThenWeHaveSecondsLeftOvertoTalkToSomeoneWhileWaitingForTrafficatAStopSignInParallelWithAnOncomingCarThatEatsFivePeopleDrivingAsOneSpeedingAroundTurnAfterExcludingSevenMinutesAtBreakDownOfLightBusBeforeEnterINGInterstateHighwayHeadingOutOFCityBoundryAreaHalfRenewalCostIsSubsequentlyDoublePrincipleCitedEquationFromBookApplyingConceptExplainHowThisScenarioRelatedDoNotAssumeUniformVelocityAcrossEntireDistanceOrConsiderVariableConditionsImplicitlyUnderstoodVariablesIntroducedButNeitherDefinedPreciselyAreChallengersYourSkillsPutYouHereJustRightNowWhere",
