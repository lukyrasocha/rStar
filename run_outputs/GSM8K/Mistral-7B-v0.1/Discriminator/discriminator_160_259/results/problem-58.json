Adding up their ages presently sums to $21+63+42=126$. Addition happens yearly hence when you increase this resultant value adding thrice (considering future scenario) makes it equal to $(126x3)=378$. Dividing both sides with four indicates us towards our intended solution making them avg=$378\\div4=94.5$, so considering time increment due to passage over time(i.e.,threeyear period),it goes like $avarage_{time}=94.5+3$;which means averaging these numbers results into roughly,$a_n\u224897.5$.
