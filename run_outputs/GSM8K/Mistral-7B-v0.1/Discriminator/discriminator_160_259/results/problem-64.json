To calculate overall spending we multiply individual costs times time spent using them respectively, i.e., (Benji\u2019s Cost/Hour)x(Amount Of Time Benji Uses Equipment)+(Carlos'Cost / Hour) x (Amount OfTime Carlos Spends Using It). This works out as ($18Per Hour\u00d7NumberOfHoursUsedByBenjithisBoat)(+($30 Per Hour \u00d7 NumberofhoursusedcarloforthisCanoe)).

That means we\u2019re looking to find values such as when Carlos spends four times what Benjie (ben) spent because 4*$18= $72 which exceed our threshold but not quite yet; here $(x+y)>=(0.5)-(($2+$z))=>[((x/4)+(y/$5)]$(a)(b)=ab. However this isn't practical due to nonlinear factors influencing time needed since rates don't equalize quickly enough without additional assumptions or constraints like using fractions greater than .5 leading us instead directly towards solving through linear equations yielding z= ((0.5)$+(p*q)/(r^m) => [z>(0.5)* p/c ; q > m*(i+n); n<=d]. This scenario calls upon basic algebra skills employing substitution methods ultimately isolating variables within quadratic expressions while ensuring validity based around initial financial ceilings thereby preventing unrealistic duration results whilst maintaining accuracy across varied durations necessitating thorough computation efforts especially amidst complex systems possibly involving exponential growth functions thus provoking deeper mathematical exploration regarding optimal utilization strategies concerning limited resources coupled wth desired outcomes minimizing operational expenses accordingly though still enabling adequate usage under set parameters hence achieving maximum potential benefits subjectively tailored according individuals needs preferences habits & interests albeit also requiring careful consideration accountability oversight compliance standards etc considering safety health environmental impact economic implications technology compatibility accessibility inclusiveness societal norms political climate ethical considerations global context interdisciplinary perspectives historical trends philosophical paradigms spiritual dimensions psychological constructs emotional intelligence cognitive behavioral theories scientific methodologies data analysis statistical modeling quantitative research qualitative inquiry literature review synthesis critical thinking reflection introspection mindfulness meditation existentialism absurdism solipsism skepticism empiricism rationalism phenomenology deconstruction postmodernism futurism utopian idealism apocalyptic vision transhumanism technogaianism ecofeminist theory neoliberal economics social democracy progressivism conservatism libertarian politics communitarian justice solid",
