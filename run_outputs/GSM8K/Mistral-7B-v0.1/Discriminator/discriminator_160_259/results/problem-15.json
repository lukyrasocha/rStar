By showing explicitly what numbers represent particular expenses & revenues associated w specific action(ex: buying material), users gain intuition upon seeing numerical representations beforehand being combined together resulting potentially reducing misconceptions later encountered while doing math mentally especially during exam situations requiring quick mental arithmetic rather than having chance o review concepts involved thoroughly first prior attempting calculation procedures within problem itself thereby saving crucial thinking space needed once exams begin commencing again possibly causing mistakes due lack understanding initially established early enough thus increasing probability success rates improving overtime through practice exercises employing said methods instead guesswork based solely off instinct alone hoping correct decisions emerge spontaneously nonetheless frequently failing every few instances despite best efforts applied consistently throughout lifelong learning experiences achieved via education programs offered colleges universities public schools various types community institutions private entities amongst numerous other platforms available online free access anywhere worldwide accessible instantly retrieved almost instantaneously regardless location geographical boundaries existence physical presence individuals themselves merely connecting globally sharing knowledge freely among populace irrespective nationality religious beliefs gender sexual orientation economic status age ethnic background social standing familial roles profession occupation hobbies interests preferences habits behavioral traits characteristics general life patterns personal qualities strength attributes weakness flaws deficiencies challenges hurdles barriers obstacles blockades impediments handlings setback backfires failures disappointments letdownings hardships struggles trials tribulations travails vicissitudes adversities calamities catastrophes disasters ruinations distractions delays delay punctualities tardiness lateness postponements retardation interruptions omissions lapses negligence carelessness errors blunders mishaps faults defectiveness slipped up stupid faux pas clumsy acts accidents collateral damage unforeseen outcomes unplanned events serendipitous occurrences unexpected",
