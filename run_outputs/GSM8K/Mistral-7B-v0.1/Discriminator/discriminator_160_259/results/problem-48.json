        " cakes Rose bought on Tuesday. According to the question, this was triple the amount purchased on Monday (i.e., it would equate to Friday\u2019s figure). Calculating this means you need to multiply 4 (Monday) by 3 which equals to 12 on Tuesday. Next identify rose purchases during wedge. Remembering multiplication takes precedence over addition or subtraction within these operations, we find Rose ordered thrice as numerous items on Wednesday than she obtained on Tuesday; hence multiplying 12 (Tuesdays figures) by 5 comes up 60 (Wednesday purchase numbers), thus resulting into 'rose_ordered_onwednesday'. Lastly compute roses overall ordering magnitude through amalgamation summing respective quantities garnered across weekdays i.e \u2018cumulative orderings(mondays+tuesdays+wendeds)` This operation demands computing sums of values attained sequentially without employing any particular arithmetic function/calculator tool since no such tools can substitute manual computation process when dealing directly textually presented mathematical problems requiring mental calculation capabilities.) Combining results collected throughout separate periods delivers us cumulative order amounts \u2013 here expressed mathematically -> cumulative orders := moonys->orders=monday+tihsday*orders+=wensdaytotal_ordering =>  ",
        "; therefore, multiply 3*Mondays_cakes (or use multiplication). That results into 12 cakes sold on Tuesday. Next identify the amount of sales recorded on Wednesday. Use similar logic as above, multiplying Thursdays_purchase by 5 which yields you getting 60 items purchased on Wednesday. Finally sum up these amounts using addition operation ((Mon) +(Tue)+Wed)=Cake Total Overall Lastly express this calculation numerically i.e., calculate your solution based off values obtained during process thus resulting equation becomes like below CakeTotalOverall= Mon+Tue+Wed By plugging numerical values found earlier we obtain our overall quantity calculated equals to Fourteen so rose made fourteen purchases altogether over span Three Days",
        " Define \u2018x\u2019 as amount spent per customer since it changes based on their age according to tax law details provided above (for which we already calculated specific prices before). We know Alice pays less because Alice falls into lower income bracket whereas Bob receives higher rates due to increased wealth. By setting up equations like those used previously, one can represent these conditions mathematically hence determining respective spending amounts 'a' and 'b'. Solving them using substitution method or system elimination would result in particular values indicating exact amounts respectively paid out/spent upon purchases i.e., items purchased minus applicable discount totals representing true cost implications brought about via alterations made within pricing scales linked directly towards socio-political contextual factors such us government regulations imposed aiming towards equitable economic practices amongst citizens amidst differing financial standings prevalent during democratic setups thereby ensuring no individual being disproportionately affected when seeking essential services offered publicly free under constitutional rights guaranteeing accessibility regardless disparity levels experienced daily both individually & collectively through society comprising varied group memberships influenced heavily shaped social stratification structure dictated historical precedents leading modern societal frameworks established throughout past centuries impact present dynamics perpetuated across forthcoming generational cycles further reinforcing underlying ideologies promoting inherently humanistic principles found pivotal influencer interpersonal relationships personal development growth opportunities beyond immediate realms fostering sustainable progressive advancement enabling continued evolution aligned harmoniously existing global cooperation mutually beneficial exchanges facilitated transcendent shared aspirations inspiring innovative creativity collaboratively driven initiatives generating productivity positive outcome transformative change realized universality applying inclusive strategies recognizing multifaceted diversity honoring uniqueness appreciating variation acknowledging difference embracing pluralism navigating complex challenges coordinating efforts resourcefully effectively coherently concertedly orchestrating symphony ensemble working together unified purpose single mission goal deliver optimum results maximized potential capitalize synergistically leveraging combined strength advantageous efficiency gain significant value contribution elevate overall quality life enhance happiness uplift spirits hope renew confidence fortify resilience build character integrity personhood cultivate virtuous traits promote ethics morale encourage proactive engagement participatory governance responsible stewardship active citizenship mindful actions intentional behaviors deliberate choices decisions meaningful legacy lasting influence construct new",

Add up the amounts of individual cake purchases throughout these time periods. To find out the overall quantity, add together your obtained values i.e., summing them yields 4 + 12 + 60 equals 76; thus, this represents our cumulative or 'total'.

        " 4 (the quantity on Monday) multiplied by 3 which equals 12 cakes on Tuesday. Next, identify the number of cakes purchased on Wednesday. According to the problem, it was stated as being fifty percent larger than what was bought on Tuesday. That implies we need to find half of the amount sold on Tuesday i.e., one half times twelve or six additional amounts. Thus, if you add those extra quantities from Tuesday onto what was initially bought indicates ten units. Combine these purchases over these periods; so when summing up your results this involves adding together 4 (from Monday), plus 12 (Tuesday\u2019s purchase) and finally, addition of the last value representing ten cake buying sessions during Wednesday. Doing mathematical calculations yields forty minus eight equal seventy four indicating exactly that count.

Lastly rose purchases yet again but only half (`one time less than four`) last weekend which symbolizes Friday before Saturday i.e., WEDNESDAY CAKES `(FRI_CAKES = HALF*YESTERNDAYS_SAME(ONE_SUCH))`.
