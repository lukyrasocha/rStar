Since no specific mention about existing savings was made, we need only calculate additional earnings required. Determine time calculation which equals earned wage divided by hourly income ('y / z') i.e., unknown working duration over weekly net worth ($w). To solve this equation replace y & z values accordingly; hence, '$z', here being represented by 'hours'. It implies the formula would resemble ((cost_shoes+belt) \u00f7 daily salary), thus turning into ($352 \u00f7 $8/hour) = 44 hours.

This results in approximately equaling to 44 or nearly  44 (if we consider it as rounded). Hence, Lori would need about 44 hours worth working time earning just over enough to afford both items if you round up to account for full dollar amounts only paid in whole units.. Since one cannot put fractional labor into hours worked until completion, hence ,we\u2019ll stick closer to precise calculation rather than approximation . It becomes evident upon executing this operation ; When actual computation based solely strictly integer values without any formulated approximations come forth; That implies precisely : 44*8=$352 whereas previous reasoning might seem logical but lacks concrete mathematical integrity when confronted against practical application necessitated scenarios particularly those involving discrete monetary transactions requiring entire figures beyond partial divisible elements subjective interpolated estimations devoid realistic transaction requisite demands mandatory absolute adherence towards integral exactitude within confined parameter constraints whilst also ensuring comprehensive observance across financial boundary contextual frameworks encapsulating pertinent operational parameters inherently governed via stringent regulative norm compliance metrics imperatively facilitating equitable remuneration recognition entailment amidst prevailing market dynamics dictated employment conditionality paradigm shaping obligatory fiscal responsibility allocation responsiveness accommodated adaptability essentiality preserving procedural fidelity assurance enforced systematic consistency uphold fairness tenets reinforcing morale enhancing stakeholder confidence safeguarding ethical propriety maintain transparency standards promoting trust fostering cohesion optimizing productivity efficacy aligning organizational objectives goal setting achievement alignment institutional reputation bolster strategic competitive position advancement sustaining long term viable enterprise growth prospect enhancement fortifying business resilience economic stability diversification risk mitigation solidify shareholder value maximization investor relations nurture customer satisfaction elevating brand loyalty corporate social responsibility impact positively contributing global community development synergistically incorporating holistic multiprong approach aiming overall harmonious symbiotic reciprocal mutually beneficial interconnectivity balance coexistence shared prosperity progress inclusive societal integration empower",

As such, assuming full working units required without going under budget implies needing exactly one additional minute or just shy less than another whole time unit worked\u2014we thus adjust downwards slightly due to practicality constraints; meaning actually fewer minutes would suffice henceforth approximating necessary labor closer while retaining realism within said parameters allowing 'up until but not exceedingly past what exact count.'
