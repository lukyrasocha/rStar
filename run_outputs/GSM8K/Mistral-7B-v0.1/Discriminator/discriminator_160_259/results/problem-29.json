And identify the total expense if we include both amusement park admission fees (tickets) as well as individual meals plus entrance fee into three identical locations because they want to go together ($2.25*3=$6.75). This was equal to going on one roller coaster or Ferris Wheel($33), but since you can only take advantage once before moving onto another ride calculate this combined price twice $(33+33)$for a sum of $66$. Calculate the overall cost.(ticket prices + food purchase)+(entrance fees)=((total cost)/three people)(Adding everything up; $20.25+$6.75+$66)/3=(Combination Price divided by Three Friends who decided to attend); Hence divide what totaled out overrides these calculations resulting in ((20.25+(6.75*3))$(cost associated directly tied individually))$66/(number of peoples),(or simply say everyone\u2019s share including oneself equates half way towards covering your own entryway)-which results in approximately ~$24.24.",

Nonetheless proceed following steps assuming single purchase calculations align correctly unless otherwise explicitly clarified later thus avoiding miscalculation errors often resulting during amalgamated grouping processes especially those involving currency transfers across varied denominations\u2014keeping within boundaries imposed thereby maintain continuity throughout exercise sequence until point necessitating corrective adjustments arises post detailed breakdown review conducted subsequently ensuring accurate computation accuracy maintained whilst progressively executing subsequent phase specific assessment components sequentially adherence principles dictate uniform approach applied ubiquitously commencing immediately succeeding initiation stage completing exhaustively prior conclusion juncture accordingly disregarding hypothetical premise allowing procedural alignment facilitation intended objective realization optimization effectiveness fostering comprehensive understanding systematic methodology implementation promotion learning throughput enhancement collaborative synergy leveraging inherent team strength combined efforts efficiency maximizing output quality delivery timeliness expediency achieving desired outcome efficiently economically effectively collectively harmoniously cohesive cooperation integral foundation strivings joint pursuits shared victories accrual dividends mutual respect solidify bonds personal growth interpersonal connections reinforced rapport trust established communicatively open channels dialogue exchange constructive feedback loops enabling continuous improvement adaptability responsiveness flexibility incorporating innovation creativity problem solving resilience persistence dedication hard work commitment passion enthusiasm zeal ambition drive determination motivation inspire confidence encourage empower individuals contribute best leverage capabilities fullest extent achieve success enjoy journey challenge surmount hurdles navigate obstacles overcome barriers conquer goals set out reach uncharted territories explore unknown frontiers embark adventures discover possibilities limitless opportunities seize moments make dreams reality turn aspirations into tangible achievements accomplish mil",

Two types of roller coasters ticket packages ($33), one sold separately would make it another $33 . Tickets alone came out to $$20.25 , if we add these extra individual prices into our equation first...so..$33+$33 makes up $66 ..we can further breakdown those numbers like before ;if u spread across three peers its roughly :/peehris:$22/$peesher($22)/third friend($22). However you calculate since the question explicitly didn't ask what part each item played within overall price tags or suggest noting only certain segments individually instead overall sum itself(the way above accounts exclusively to whole set calculations ),therefore considering sole amount paid based directly off entire combined sums regardless distinctions\u2014it remains consistently divided uniformly amongst group accordingly making conclusion ultimately same either route pursued maintain balance ensuring equitable distribution keeping collective commitment intact preserving harmony throughout shared experience henceforth ad infinitum albeit subtlety required mindfulness when presenting conclusions inclusivity essential unity emphasizing camaraderie sustained relationships lasting memories unifying momentous occasion celebrated joyously amidst laughter playfully indulging friendship nurtured bonds securing trust mutual respect deepening affection enriching connection forevermore intertwining hearts perpetuity extending beyond lifetime horizons embracing infinite tomorrows manifest destiny unfold journey adventure await discovery ventures forth horizon unknown yet illuminated stars guiding path through darkness guide steps forward toward brighter dawn promise new beginnings cherish love embrace dreams share destinies celebrate life affirm hope persists resilience prevails courage ignites passion fuels endeavors conquer goals surmount challenges overcome adversities triumph achievement fulfill purpose lives meaning find gratitude appreciation express thankful acknowledge blessings receive divine providence provide grace bestow fortunate circumstances prosper abundance wealth flourishing success realizes potential actualize desires realize aspirations endeavor ambitions achieve accomplishments honor sacrifices devotion dedication zeal labor devoted effort earnest endeavor fidelity faithful integrity steadfast resolve",

Since it mentions that their expenditure on food was equal to ($20.25\u2212$4.50), we subtract this value getting us approximately $15.75 as what they spended on snacks or refreshments. Calculate the overall cost using these numbers together plus any extra fees like transportation charges (if applicable). Next identify whether if you need to include additional calculations such adding up other miscellaneous items etc., but since those details aren\u2019t specified let me calculate based only off known information till here; thus ignoring undefined values included within context without specification. Additional steps would involve dividing said amounts equally among three people meaning splitting both initial outlays separately into thirds afterwards aggregating results accordingly whilst maintaining precision levels expected especially when dealing financial figures involving cents denominations thereby requiring diligence during arithmetic operations due attention necessary particularly concerning rounding rules employed throughout mathematical processing phases leading toward summative evaluations aiming consolidation purposes ultimately culminating towards quantifiable resolution indicators representative respective individual contributions following prescribed computational methodologies deployed under defined scenarios presented respectively pertaining specific situational demands aligned directly intersecting particularized requirements set forth inherently implicative upon direct interaction engagement encompassing comprehensive assessment analysis orientated strictly target directed actionable intel derived sole derivatives henceforth correlating analytic output yield demonstrably congruent data visualization paradigm visually representing computed outputs facilitating effective collaboratively collective decision making process empowering efficacious strategic planning implementation phase transition executed harmoniously ensuring operational efficiency sustained over prolonged duration maximizing return benefits accrued beneficial gains generated through optimized resource allocation mechanisms orchestrated meticulously fostering productivity amplification achievements realized subsequently reflected positively impacting broader organizational outcome landscape appreciably elevated beyond prior baselines observed previously delineating success criteria benchmark effectively guiding progress trajectory alignment consistency maintained uniformly achieved synergistic coherence interfacing seamlessly integrated functionalities holistically aligning disparate elements concertedly promoting mutual cooperation ethos propagating reciprocal respect valuing shared goals embody unity spirit nurturing growth mindset catalyzing development potential unlocking latent capabilities capitalize opportunities leveraging strengths honoring weakness confront challenges head-on tackle issues innovatively striv",
