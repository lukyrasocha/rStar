Calculate the mass required/perimeter needed / daily intake using multiplication as follows: Multiply rate times time: Weekly consumption can therefore calculated this way (.42857pounds x 1week). To convert rates from units such as weeks into smaller components like hours, you calculate them differently based upon unit conversion factors which include fractional ratios used here because; One hour consists of fourteen workable periods divided evenly among six forty minute quarters making thirty working minutes equals seventeen twenty second increments consisting either twelve eighty seconds intervals plus fifty sixty fourth portions within equal distribution across eighteen complete segments resulting nineteen third octaves spaced equally apart spanning three score years thus divide their overall quantity before multiplying when solving problems involving different measure systems.. Therefore if we multiply our previous result obtained earlier hence ((35lbs)/d)(wk)=(([(.42857lb)]*[(one wk)^(-1))])=([{.042857})]which converts all other measures stated above expressed throughout most common conversions applied universally accepted worldwide thereby achieving accuracy whilst ensuring efficiency due primarily derived through standardization practices inherent toward facilitating global commerce particularly those products requiring frequent delivery including foodstuff medication supplies automotive lubricants avionics equipment spare parts etcetc Thus simplifying further allows us ultimately reach precise results since lesser values denote larger sums corresponding specifically regarding volume capacity while remaining consistent against variable length dimensionality varying according both temporal duration lengths associated sequential order numbers denoting particular specific instances occurrence events occurring instantaneously contemporarily intertwined subsequently producing congruence despite diverse representations utilized elsewhere typically seen during numerical notation employed alongside distinct methodologies customary practice frequently observed regardless geographic locales promoting uniform understanding commonly adopted around globe irrespective national boundaries prevailing otherwise restrictively constraining cross border integration potentially undermining cooperative efforts fostering collective advancement globally recognized benefit accrued mutually advantageous circumstances arising out interaction sharing resource pool collaboratively enhancing respective individual capabilities increasing cumulatively productivity level consequently creating substantial long term sustainability opportunities beyond traditional limitations hitherto imposed previously challenging formerly hampering development prospects moving forward optimistically",
