Find out the combined amount consumed by Steve and his girlfriend if we know he eats double what she does which means together it makes up three portions (because one portion is him since he eat's all). As such steves girlfriends consumption would make half or (42/2) equaling  21 tomatoes. Together both consume 21+ 42= 63 tomatoes every week. To find the required no. Of Vines divide their overall requirement i.e., 63 Tomatoes / Tomato production rate(i.e , 3tomatospervinet)= 21 . ",
