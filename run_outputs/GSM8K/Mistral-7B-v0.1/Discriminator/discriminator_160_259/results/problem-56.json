By June (six months later), assuming no further late fees accrue nor other such conditions arise within our simplified version these calculations serve well enough under circumstances allowing consistent regular repayments throughout entire term duration until ultimate settlement date comes round hence not requiring any amendment considerations; thus six months translate into simply multiplying sixty seven cents times three resulting equalling twenty eight point zero four thirty seconds minus eighteen plus ten percent translating ultimately leading up reaching forty thousand ninety dot twelve divided amongst whole periods equals seventeen fifteen hundred .

At this point we know that if paid regularly every three years, which amounts approximately to $460 ($(165x12)/3), all debt can indeed eventually get rid off since the whole sum needed equals exactly twice what Janeth promises upon leaving but not including any other possible complications or fees such inflation etc; thus concluding our calculation without having further considerations into these factors because unless specifically stated otherwise those kinds don\u2019t usually occur here nor generally affect ordinary transactions like personal loans taken care off directly between individuals only among them themselves instead institutions).

However, we can approximate using equal payment method over 1 year i.e., calculate average daily or equivalent proportional change which might not accurately represent real life scenarios but provide useful insight into basic financial planning approaches often seen in budgeting apps & personal finance plans etc.. Here's one such simplified calculation process : First determine principal amounts/values throughout time periods based upon compounding formulas below formula=P((r)^(n))where P represents present value; r specifies periodic /compound interst rates ; n indicates timesinterest applied . To illustrate assume initially jane owes us cash totalling 'principlevalue', hence when calculated ,we get initial result correspondingly reducing later due changes made during repayment phase thus enabling new balances getting derived every consecutive interval through above procedure mentioned earlier till completion date expected according timeline set forth previously making sure overall outcome matches agreedupon expectations whilst maintaining integrity towards original agreement signed amongst parties involved thereby prevent possible disputes arising post settlement occurrence resulting potential loss either financially economically legally consequently having both sides feel satisfied regarding transaction completed satisfactorily providing last word clarity about future relationship once again reinforcing trustworthy nature demonstrated hereunder ensuring mutual growth together moving forwardwards happier lives beyond mere material gains achievement goals pursued collectively contributing productive efforts benefiting all relevant stakeholders positively impact society alike encouraging further development helping human kind flourish globally uplift standard quality education healthcare medical services accessible across regions irrespective borders geographical landmarks boundaries whatever physical constraints obstruct normal routine living experiences generally associated traditional societal norms hinder innovation encourage progress fostering creativity imagination learning inspiring diverse opportunities empower individual choices decision maker abilities critical thinking skills developed via lifelong learning attitude embody positive energy personality traits promoting teamwork collaboration cohesion community building social interaction communication exchange sharing knowledge ideas concepts opinions philosophies moral principles ethics religious teachings customary practices cultures traditions folklore music arts literature poetry prose fiction nonfiction books anthologies essays poems letters journals chronicles biographies memoir autobiography historical documents archives records primary source research secondary analysis commentaries critique evaluation review feedback suggestions recommendations proposals reports summarization abstract",

        " original price ($2000) amounts to (1/10*1)*$2000=[$]200$. Since this was applied over a year or twelve times [1]*[12], every single payment includes not only part of principal but also part of compound interests until termination of debt contract(in our case up till sixteenth repayment).

We assume here no other transaction occur such deposit withdrawal etc., so simply fill every thing inside our formula equation thus,(Remainder)=$2000+((12month)/2)\u00d7($165/$year*(rate))=>,$2000+$12x ($165 x .0083)$= ~$2551 Assuming everything remains constant throughout period mentioned.$",
        " Firstly, let's calculate how much Janeth agreed to repay including interest (extra charge). It would be: original loan ($2000) plus extra charges which account for 10%, so add another 1/10th or simply multiply 2000 \u00d7 0.1 equals 200. That means janet promises to repay back the full initial sum together with these extras totalling up as follows :  2000+200= 2200 . Secondly we need find out just what part Janeth pays every month since this seems like it might help break things down into manageable units. We know one installment payment period lasts eight weeks but usually bills get paid weekly rather than fortnightly , however here only twelve month periods worth sixteen times occur within those same time frame thus providing slightly different options; therefore dividing both sides even further yields something around $.27 per day when taking care also consider rounding rules applied later along side other complications such varying lengths across various types etc., if someone borrows say '$5k over year ' instead youd probably want them earn about half their income rate meaning roughly 1 /month/$wks$days ? Therefore calculating through all factors mentioned above reveals our solution being actually less complicated yet involving somewhat indirect manipulation methods ; hence making sure everything remains accurate throughout calculations !

Given this information we can calculate how long until payment begins again using formula $\\frac{Principal}{Monthly Payment}$. This returns us value X equals approximately  5. Here you could see something interesting; if only Principal was divided over n (number of Month) instead of getting actual accumulated principle ($x$) , result stays same...because everytime any sum lesser than initial loan+interest accrues happens during course of time period(say N),so actually calculated Pn still leads back up close to original calculation..which basically confirms our previous observation that no matter what order values come out when used inside math operators like \"/\" symbol before being evaluated against integers such ..as \"$\\cdot$\".

        " (annual interest/number of months) which equals ($200 / 12). That means Janet would owe approximately $16.67 per month just as simple Interest because this assumes no compounding effects due to continuous repayments every month. But since we know she pays back exactly what includes both principal sum plus accumulated interests throughout all twelve months together equaling only $165 times 12 or $1980 \u2013 subtract off original principle loan amount being paid within one year including calculated interest; $((($1980-$2000)+$200)/12)=$-166.67/(year).
