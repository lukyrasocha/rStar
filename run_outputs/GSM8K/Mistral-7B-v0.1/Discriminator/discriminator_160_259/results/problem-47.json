This situation needs additional constraints such as quantity/count ratio or any relationship involving quantities instead of simply stating individual item weights like what was asked before i.e., 'Weight'. However assuming everything else remains constant here would mean every singular piece carries equal contribution to whole mass regardless their distinct type; thus you merely multiply count (* n*) against known single measurement (** m** )to yield cumulative sum(*n*m).. Given condition however requires cross comparisons implying difference exists thereby necessitating differentiation amongst them .

This would mean adding up another amount equalizing out any remaining discrepancies resulting only upon reaching either side through division/subtraction methods within certain boundaries set forth throughout history\u2013and thus creating additional layers beneath original ones until finally arriving directly above ground level...
