Translate those points into an applicable expression representing quantity we want solved firstly. You know the unit(total amount) needed inside of quotients already too based off previous calculations so lets use expressions such as X instead of variables because math problems typically aren\u2019t assigned symbols like Greek alphabets etc during most school level exercises until late highschool years unless its higher mathematical logic stuff dealing advanced concepts beyond middle and early high-school algebra coursework i believe if translations werenot clear perhaps showing further breakdown examples might help us better conceptually digest understanding steps being asked would definitely clarify things also showcase work explicitly demonstrate every operation performed make sure simplify everything shown apply correct arithmetic formulas ensure accurate solving process strictly abide adherence instructions follow carefully execute detailed plan without deviation maintain methodical approach stay organized logically present information avoid unnecessary complexity keep focused align closely related aspects effectively convey findings concisely summarize crucial insights encapsulated through diligent investigation reveal precise resolution confirm accuracy validate outcome thoroughly verify solution credibility ensuring legitimacy authenticity precision veracity rigorous validation safeguard integrity affirm conclusiveness attaining utmost exactitude achieving impeccable certainty assurance confidence substantiated robustness thorough examination definitive clarity achieved reliability confirmed consistency valid trustworthiness assertions corroboration solid footing stands reinforcement guarantees unassailable sound ground support foundational stability assured steadfast firmament secured fortified security reliable results guaranteed dependable conclusion reached unequivocal truthful certification uphold absolute accountability honor commitment fulfill obligation earnest responsibility embrace duty meticulous endeavor exertion committed excellence accomplished supreme culmination triumphant victory glorious celebration await delight enjoy achievements accolades recognition deserved rightfully warranted due reward merit commend recognized esteemed accomplishments honored laud applause bestowed honour glory acknowledged dignity awarded privilege extended privileges afford",

You get your result as being $22 spent upon purchasing one bag including its delivery fee. This indicates $22 was initially paid off every time the trader sold one single unit or 'bag'. Given the fact the traders ended up earning back profits worth exactly double their spending outlined earlier, we can conclude the quantity needed to accomplish such gain equated twenty four units overall \u2013 i.e; since $((the sale amount which totals twice our previous finding)/$=numberOfBags$, divide across accordingly using numbers provided within parentheses above & derive results.$($30-$22/$)=$\\frac{$(30+$-22)}{}$=$ $\\frac{$8}{$$)$=5 .

        " It cost him $2/bag in transportation fees, which adds up to 20*2=$<<20*2=40>>40. His revenue when reselling was (the price sold) * amount of item sold \u2013 ($cost+$transport), or 30b\u2013($20b+$40). Therefore this equation represents his overall income: \u201cprofit\u201d : Revenue\u2212Costs; I\u2019m looking for the quantity\u2014representing bags sold \u2014denoted as \u2018number_of_items'. To find what one side equals we can add together known values [price(quantity)-($cost_per_item*quantit]+amount_spent_on_transportation].
