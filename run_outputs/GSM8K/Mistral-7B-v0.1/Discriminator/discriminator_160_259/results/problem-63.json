To find out what one third amounts to when applied to this expenditure we divide our original budget of '$15000', namely \\[ \\frac{1}{3}(15000) \\] (one divided into three equal parts), which results in '$5000'. Summing up both budgets yields $[(15000)+(5000)]$, or dollar sign plus four zeroes minus comma equals sixteen thousand as represented below [$(1+$($\\tfrac{1}{3}$*($1+5)*1=[$])]=['='[+']]=[][[]]=$[].

        " $$$15,000$$$. We calculate one/third (or multiply) this figure. One-third multiplied by $$$15,000$$$ results in $$\\$5,000\\text{.}$$ Hence when we add both amounts together ($$$15,000+ \\$5,000= \\$20,000)$$$, it shows us what was spent over those months. Thus the correct option would indeed be C.$$$\\boxed{\\$20,000}$$$ .",
        " advertising for the second year as one-third (or divided) of what was initially spend. From this case we know it means dividing ($15000/3). This calculation yields : $$$=\\dfrac{1}{3}\\times$$$\\(= \\$5000 \\divided\\) or simplified into $$$\\frac{\\frac{15,000}{1}}{3}$$. Dividing both numbers results thusly into $\\frac{15,000\\cancel{{}}{}}{\\text{$}{\\$}}$. Perform division operation next so $$\\frac{15,\\cancel{{}}000\\!} {3}=$$ =\\$5000 Spent over the course of these two years add up all expenses involved during these times period i.e., (\\${}\\)+\\$({})$. Substitutin values here gets us \\\\(\\$5000 +\\$5000\\\\)\\($$). Hence , adding everything leads to finally getting our solution.$$\\,\\,$\"The ",
        " one-third as much (which means divide it into three equal parts) which translates mathematically as dividing 15000/3 equals roughly ~$5000(rounding off). Finally calculate their combined spendings over both years which involves adding up all expenses thus coming out at approximately $15000 plus about $5000 sums upto around \\$20000$. Thus we see here that regardless of breaking down operations this way or doing them directly without additional computations; our result remains unchanged because mathematics fundamentals remain constant i.e., addition operation isn\u2019t affected when performed sequentially vs simultaneously since basic arithmetic principles apply universally! Therefore \"$20,000\" could also rightfully become \"\\$(a little less than exactly)\" due to rounding differences based upon numerical precision etc used during intermediate calculations but still serves adequately representing overall cost aggregation per stipulations implied within provided contextual scenario framework set forth thereby yielding conclusive valuation metric expressly intended suitably reflectively coinciding faithlessly congruently corresponding satisfactorily cohesively correlatively succinctly signifying entirety inclusively integrative sum amalgamated accordingly accentuating holistic financial accountability effectively efficiently precisely punctually pragmatically promptly pertinently prudently persistently plausibly practicable feasible henceforth commencing subsequent undertakings confidentiality compassionality cordiality diplomacy graciousness hospitable honeydew humility integrity kindliness loveliness mercifulness munificence nobler obsequiousness pacifism perfectibility peacefulness politeness pure goodness quiescence sanctimony temperance tenacity utmost worthwhile wealthiest wisdom workmanship Xmas yen zeal zest\".",
        " times their previous cost which equals $(1/3) x ($15000)=$5000 . Find the sum paid over both periods; you just need to add together all amounts expended during those periods.. Therefore, we get $$($15000+$5000)=$$$20000 as our solution. To check if it makes sense let's rephrase : This business outlay shows clear dedication towards increasing consumer engagement through strategic ad placements resulting in higher brand visibility and potentially improved market share over time considering influx factors such as economy shifts impacting purchasing power among target audience demographics., meaning investment directed towards promotion may yield significant ROI due to heightened interest generated thereby leading increased sales performance reflective trend across similar industries subject to same economic variables within period under review .. Given this context ,the proposed financial allocation proves appropriate based upon prevailing industry benchmark standards indicating average budgetary commitments hover around mid six figures annually when aligned against key performance indicators associated success metrics namely conversion rates paired alongside bottom line growth attainable goal trajectories expected post implementation assuming no external negative disruptors encountered (economical downturn etc.) hence validated overall value derived surpasses estimated costs involved thus making said scenario optimal approach choice despite upfront fiscal burdens required initially prior initiative commencement phase completion subsequent data analytics driven decision cycle adaptations made subsequently realigned focus areas likely necessary enhance long term sustainability further fortified position held vis viva competitive landscape whilst fostering robust internal culture promoting proactive continuous improvement drives inherently beneficial catalyst positive change facilitator propelling forward momentum essential element driving organizational evolution crucial stakeholder relations cultivation critical aspect core objective maximizing profit margin objectives ensuring enterprise solvency preserving customer loyalty imperative operational efficiency maintain viable commercial operations prerequisite survival vitality lifeblood corporate existence without question fundamental principle guide actions decisions directions path traversed journey undertaken every challenges opportunity seized navigated hurdles obstacles overcome ultimately achieving desired outcome successfully accomplished venture well executed endeavor fiscally soundly structured plan meticulously craftily designed finely tuned execution masterfully performed culminating grand successful victory celebratory fanfare triumphantly emerged victoriously unscathed financially intact operation continuing progressively ascending its"
