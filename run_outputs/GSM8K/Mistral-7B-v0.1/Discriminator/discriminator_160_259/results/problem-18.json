To figure out their collective share based upon this information you just need to add them all up. Thus, combining Bo's, Monic's and Rani's individual totals leads us to get ((Bo's total)+Monic's Total+(Rani's)) = ((40)+(16)+((26))) equaling 40+16+26 equals <<40+16+26=82>>82total crabs possessed combined..
