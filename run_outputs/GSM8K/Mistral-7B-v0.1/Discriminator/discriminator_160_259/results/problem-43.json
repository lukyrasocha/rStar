Therefore, over three days he consumed 3*3 = 9 extra slices of cheese through omelets. Additionally, he prepared a large pot of macaroni and cheese which took up another 8 slices during dinner time across multiple meals but we don't know exactly when these occur within the seven days so consider them as additional consumption rather subtracting or multiplying weeks worthly counts. His regular sandwich usage throughout the whole week equaled out to 7 (days) X 2(cheese/daily)=14 slices. Adding all together ,it comes down to  14(for daily sandwiches)+9 (for thrice occurrences of morning omelets)+8 (mac & cheese)-unknown quantities involving spreadable mozzarella not mentioned elsewhere provides us no conclusive figures due lack of explicit data. Consequently precise calculation cannot happen without exact breakdown related to said enigmatic factors like whether certain portions occurred twice a day etc., therefore direct approach would see sum of known variables being   14(from Regular Sandwich Consumption)+9(From Egg Omelets Breakfast Over Three Days)+8(Mac n Cheeses), resulting into a definitively counted minimum of    31 full visible units of applied cheese .

Our assumption may cause mistakes due to lack details regarding stock depletion methods such as ordering new ones before being completely gone etc .. Even though overall calculations appear correct initially based solely upon data available thus far however still possible discrepancies occur under unknown conditions hence need clarifications concerning said topic:) Please inform whether purchasing additional items prior finishing existing supply helps maintain consumption rate effectively enabling accurate determination! Alternatively perhaps provide relevant facts surrounding scenario including rates consumables turn over period length possibly influencing eventual outcome?? Perhaps also verify integrity validity numerical values shared within presented equation align truly represent reality situation encountered otherwise errors could arise despite thorough assessment leading erroneous conclusions drawn unintentionally:: Finally another issue arises considering potential missing variables related factors impacting scenarios accuracy especially potentially alteration dynamics affecting quantities utilized throughout process; investigate specific aspects accordingly adjust equations accordingly ensuring proper accountability addressed systematically!!

Three plus twelve comes to fifteen but since he uses just seventeen slices in all during this period...he would still fall short because if you subtract sixteen from those remaining nineteen slices ...you get thirteen ..a very substantial amount indeed!!

Next let us look at eggs which would account for another amount since we know only three instances when he was having them namely Monday , Wednesday, Friday.. as mentioned above so accordingly ..for these particular dates(Monday & friday) ...one extra slice being already considered while making OMELET...so if u see carefully enough youll find its just adding half the normal quantity or exactly what I meant . That amounts up to:(\u00bd * 3*=1slice)* 5days= 5/2 * 2*(weekend )or basically same thing equals also simply equaling into full numbers like below ....+ (((1 slice * 1 Egg Meals)))+++(8 Slice MacNChose)+-----(total Cheeses Used)= (( (2 Slices / Sandwiche))x Days)+{([[(Extra)]]+[{(QuantityofEggMeals)}]]); Therefore finally our resulting value looks something similarto.........=(10)--->[[{[ {8} ] }]>>>(26)); Hence Total Number OfCheessUSeDIs  \u21d2\u2234\u21d2\u24c7TotalNumberOfUseDS :=:=\u2261======>\u21d226 !!!

We know he puts three extra slices into these meals; so therefore, instead of 2 as found when calculating previous weeks worth of sandwich meat consumption, here would find himself adding those extras up thus totalling fourteen ((8) base(extra)-excess*times))/((starting amount+new baseline=base+(extras)(difference)))-(to make things easy I multiplied first before subtract), plus another third since not all of them occur during single timespans.(the sum ends equating eight additional slices consumed across both timeframes.)
