Let us assume correct prices instead i..e., Cost Price per Unit/Action figure can range anywhere say X Hence assuming least possible scenario if we consider just Quantity without considering any change in proportioning Cars+Figures_Cost=$(5*X)+(3*$x)$ ....this could translate into actual monetary terms since we don\u2019t know exactly what \u2018one unit\u2019 signifies \u2026so I won\u2019t take leaps Further adding up the Doll Equivalent Cost would therefore amount to:(Cars+$doll)=$(4*$x)+($9$) ..Now lets calculate Total Expenditure=(Quantities)*Prices....We equated previous totals $(5X+3X)+[($(4X)+$9)].....which simplifies further leading me back againto earlier equation\u2026So unless Units Values become clear Elsewhere perhaps else via Market rates its impossible to derive definite sums due to lack of information provided herein !!

        " (condition)is said to equal three times this amount so it would also equate to being $. Therefore we can say condition 3 which says that four items(three actions plus one other item), or 1/x=dollary value/(price*number). We know everything but 'action_figure', therefore let's solve for them first knowing another variable ('red_car') equals . From Condition C, using substitution technique; Red Car Value=$($4$/$Number per unit$) means Action FigureValue=$($4$/$NumericalUnitOfActionFigures$). Dividing both sides by Numerical Unit Equals ($1$. When substituted into expression yields Expression:$=(TotalCostDollars)/($PricePerObjectForRedCars*$QuantityRedCars)+($PricePerObjectforActionFigures)*(/quantityofActionFigures); Given Values:\\\\[(ConditionThreeExpression\\\\]\\begin{bmatrix} Total Cost \\\\ Price Per Object \\\\ / Quantity \\end{bmatrix}\\\\)=$\\\\begin{bmatrix}(Condition Three Expression)\\\\right[$AmountEachGroupMoneyWorth]/[((Condtion Three Amount)$+(the sumamounteachobject$))\\end{(Sum Of Group)'\\\\]$=\\frac{(3$(5$,\" \",\" \", \"*\"))+$(\" \") $((\" \"$)\",*,/,*(four))}{ (\" )\"} =\\frac{\\$(\\text{' }^'$)\\cdot (\\text{\"five\")}\\+ \"\\quad\"\\cdot(\u201c\"\\space\u201d,\u201d\u201d,\u201c,,,\")\"}{\\left[\"\u2034\u2211\u2098\u208c\u2084\u200b^(\u2099\u2081\u2088)\u200b\"](\"group\",\"cost\")}$[\\frac{(totalCostItems)^(*)(nperitem)}{sumitems}]=[$$\"/ItemA]\"&\":\"\"\"\":\".format(\", \".join(toyssplit),condintone, condintoffsetzero,$(.\r",
