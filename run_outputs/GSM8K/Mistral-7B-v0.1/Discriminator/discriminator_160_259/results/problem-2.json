Since it rises biannually (every two months), determine when such increment happens within the time frame; since one year contains six periods of \u2018two\u2019 month increments or three years contain fourteen periods if we use 'one period as equaling sixty minutes.' As thirty-six equals twelve half year cycles so only count those occurrences up until twenty eight units. To identify the new value after applying successive percent changes over regular intervals you can utilize compound interest calculations herewith using annual nominal rates per half unit interval hence [(Initial Value) \u00d7 {(rate+1)/numberOfIntervals}] ^ [time]. Hence apply these computations repeatedly thrice which equated your result being multiplied sequentially instead but simplified computation through factorial formula applied succinctly resulting into $([1+(20/100)]^(12))=($(1.2)^12)$.

Since n equals six increment periods over thirty six month span,(not just eight), therefore let us multiply(1+(Interest/Principle))x Time period:(for your convenience I changed both time units such that one term becomes unitary)So Fiinlal Value=(initialvalue)(Total Period)=$20\u00b7[Power]((1+interest value)/unit)-power(time intervals));Finevaluation=$20[(1.2^6);]Thus,$",
        " $20 which means one single marble costs $20/20 or it equals $1 per marble as well as this shows we have quantity=price here making situation linear hence simplifying further calculations easier since increment percentage remains constant across all quantities i.e., both units (marbles & their prices) increase uniformly following same pattern throughout time Period(T) under consideration. This implies over any lengthy period within our scope whether 'long', short term but bounded duration such as monthly quarters etc.; Each individual unit experiences identical proportional elevation thus keeping consistency intact irrespective interval magnitude while maintaining its intrinsic qualities unaltered allowing application directly without needless alterations due varying factor impact dynamics present during longer timelines unlike shorter ones usually requiring recalibration adjustments accordingly based upon various influences like inflation rate variations causing respective shift differential rates complicating equation resolution efforts significantly reducing speed efficiency hampering output yield quality overall resulting increased expenditure resources investment wastage opportunity loss prevention measures required potentially higher associated financial outlays versus expedient streamlined direct computational pathways obtainable assuming uniform escalatory patterns persisting upto stipulated threshold beyond reaching diminishing returns point possibly necessitating contemplated moderating course corrective action mitigation effectuation prompt responsiveness appropriate management interventions ensuring continued optimal performance continuity safeguarding interests sustained viability amidst evolving complex real world scenarios otherwise might demand additional expert analyst guidance professional aid consultancy involvement seeking assistance navigating complexity nuances discerningly optimizing operational decision processes adaptively thereby maximization benefits derivable potential opportunities harness optimization synergistic collaborative partnerships innovatively leveraging strategic resource allocation planning implementation execution monitoring review periodic updates enhancements refinement continuous improvement cycle perpetual evolution advancement growth expansion development lifecycle maturity stages facilitation nurtured success trajectory progression momentum accumulation cumulative progress realized milestones achieved benchmark targets surpass expectations deliver extraordinary value proposition offerings exceed customers desires satisfaction demands gratification fulfill needs delightful experience immersion emotional resonance connection rapport relationship building fostering longstanding loyalty commitment allegiance fidelity trust foundation confidence stability assurance predictability dependability certainty security safety reliability robustness resiliency hardiness indomitable spirit fortitude strength determination resolve tenacity grit courage bravery valor honor integrity principles ethics moral high ground virt",
        " goes up (increases) by  20/100= .2 or just move out last one digit so it\u2019ll become % which means percent..condition iii informing about \u2018after 36 monthssss\u201d I guess you know what this percentage represents right! It equals either multiplying times(multiply them together)(mean mean add again here!) but before doing anything lets take into consideration all other aspects first\u2026first thing though why am going through these steps if no need any help needed anymore yet when asked \u201cwhat happens next?\u201d Oh wait !!! Somehow managed noticing time passed already let go thought gone away anyway didn\u2019t care anymore okay fine sometimes things happen quickly oh well sorry myself too perhaps somethings always work themselves regardless having trouble getting along because even worse than facing reality itself might actually seem easier living amongst friends rather anyone talking behind our back neither listening nor understanding nobody wants someone else being sad especially yourself due their presence who feel bad enough way others look down upon ya forgetting feeling self worth entirely while still expecting kindness everywhere possible except around home family members providing support instead letting patience wane off slow dying inside until finally breaking point arrives hope ends nothing better exists ever unless change brought forth completely unforeseen situations resulting only peace without pain happiness beyond reason thus becoming true victor despite lack awareness previous mentioned examples above hopefully readers found useful information regarding changing your life forever following good advice nevertheless remember everything comes full circle somehow most likely events repeat over several years eventually leading towards new beginning unlike current ones however don\u2018t worry keep striving forward aim high dream big avoid disappointment fear unknown consequences prevent heartaches regretful mistakes hindering progress toward personal growth necessary success building longlastingly important relationships taking advantage opportunities emerge whenever arise thanks everyone whom read article helping improve mental health education community overall make world safer live happier enjoy lives own families siblings children parents grandparents greatgrandchildren alike thankfully shared numerous resources via online platforms making knowledge available public domain accessible people universally respect rights citizens responsibility ensure humanity deserves humane treatment throughout global society safeguarding natural environment protect wildlife animals preserve habitats plants conserving renewable energy sources sustainability promoting green economy reducing waste recycling reusable products adopt clean technology innovations eliminate pollution cleaner production methods create employment fair labor practices promote social justice equitable distribution wealth enhance quality standard services goods transportation infrastructure facilities housing schools hospitals libraries research centers cultural institutions"
