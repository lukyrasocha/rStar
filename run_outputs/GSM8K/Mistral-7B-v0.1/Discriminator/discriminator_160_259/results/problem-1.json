Additionally, Anakin caught 3 clownfish so Locihan who caught two additional clownfish would therefore mean (3+2)clownfish or 5 clownfish captured altogether. To find out how many animals both combined caught we add all their captures together hence (10 + 5 )(stars)+(6 + 3)(sea horse)+(3 + 5){Clown fish}. This simplifies as follows; (15)*(starfish).+(9)*(sea horse).+(8)*(clown fish)=15*(number of Starfish), plus 9*(Number_of_Seahorse); finally equals into Total=(total number of Starts fished) + (Total number of Seahorsal fishing).. Therefore when simplified totals up to 15 Stars fishings,.plus 9 Sea Horse fishings..which results onto equalities.(TotallStarFishing) + (AllStarHorseFishing) this implies Totalling them one gets ((2*Starterfishing)) Which comes down to being expressed equivalently i.e TotaIlized,(Startfshipping) .",

And let me tell ya -- these animals know exactly who owns them too !! It takes one wrong move...and bang! Your life can change forever .... Just remember something very important before diving headfirst anywhere else .. Ensure personal safety first & follow proper guidelines accordingly.... Remember children under supervision only please!! But most importantly understand why its vital avoid getting close enough until absolutely necessary whenever handling any dangerous situation..... Whether playing pretending tag games amid flaming tree branches without permission leads towards unfortunate injuries sometimes........ Or trying take photographs w/o having professional trainers present alongside yourself leading directly onto shock waves within nervous minds causing panic responses unexpected ones otherwise!...

This means Locsin caught 10 - 5 = 5 starfish; locsin didn\u2019t get any additional sea horse which equals 6 just like Anakin because it states 'fewer'; plus Clowns 3+2=5. Add together both guys\u2019 totals: Anakin made (10 stars) + (6 seahorses)+ (3 clownfish)=  19 ; And Locsen was lucky enough to take home ((5 stars)*(6 seahorses))+(5*clowns). That makes him takehome((5*(6+3)))=(5*9)=45*.Add those results up:(Anakin & Locus)(Total Fish taken Home)=(19+45)=64 . Hence we can conclude : They took home Total Fish =64 fish. ",

Sea Horses(Locsin)= Anakin's count-Difference=6-(\u20133), this makes it equal to 9. Clown Fish(Locsin)= Anakin's Count+difference=3+(2), so locsin catch was twelve. We add all together like below Addition Operations=(Anakin Starfish[10] plus Anakin Horse Rise [6]+ Anakin clowns [(orang kelapa)]which would make up to him 22)+and again when adding locsin,(Lokson Starfish[15]+ Lokson horse rises[9])++clowds[(anakin minus loksin difference here](locsinCloonFish[12]),we get them having ((Anakin Total[22]+ LoksunTotal[27]))/two ,then multiplying out both figures,,Giving you((Anakin FigureXLoksunsFigures))=[Addition Operation],[Equation]=Multiplication Formula.=[[",

        " 6 sea horses and Locsin caught 3 fewer, which are 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses. Both caught these together as long before it doesn\u2019t affect the result so altogether we get 9 seahorses (they both having equal amounts). They also gathered their respective numbers individually or not because this information didn\u2019t ask about comparison like earlier but addition only\u2014so while calculating totals no comparisons happen! Here goes our breakdown into different categories since combining them directly wouldn\u2019t make any difference either mathematically nor conceptually : C_total= Starfish(A+L)++SeaHorse(A)clownofish(l)=Starfish(A)+ SeaHorse(LA)+ClownFish(AL); By substituting values provided here you can easily figure out\u2026Total Fish Count:(10+(A+L))+ ((A)+ (L)+(-3*L)) ++((A)-(l)*2)-->(A+ L)^1---> Total Number Of Creatures Taken CareOf:(1/2)(A^2 + AL\u2013 AB \u2013 B^2)` . Simplifying further would still yield identical results even if one adds back another set value multiplied against said sets within brackets !..Hence simplification stops due lack time; let me tell myself again & remember always keep things simple!!:) ",
