Since no additional such instances occur within those timescale stipulated under our defined conditions, we can proceed without alteration or adjustments concerning them. We know only about 'free', 'first-hour price', and 'rate doubling principle'. Accordingly let\u2019s determine charges as follows using logic reasoning principles relevant herein applied recursively until reaching base case.

Add all these amounts together i.e sum=[$15+$30+$60+$120]=$225. However, keep in mind since this question mentions 'one free hour', we need to subtract out any base fee associated. Hence if you take away our assumed base price($X per hr): Total Price=(Total Hours*Price)-BaseFee,$Cost=[4*$225-$x]. But without knowing X value can only calculate till known variables thus Resultant Cost=$(Calculated Value)=[(Subtract Base Fee Based From Given Values)]$.   ",
