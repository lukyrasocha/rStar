Finally, find out how long it would take to sell all the meat provided by Bill\u2019s gift using this rate. Since one cow provides approximately 750 kg or so which equals roughly 750/150 = 5 workdays; It takes about half a week under normal business operations based upon previous output rates.. The answer is: Half_workweek=(Qty)/(rate)=(750)(kilograms/(hr)*10(hours))=5days .
