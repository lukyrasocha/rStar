        " raised through sales during that period by him; this can be represented as (Number_of Lemonades) X Price(per), or 21 \u00d7 $4 which equals $84 . This suggests however that Mitchell actually earned less revenue since it\u2019s stated earlier in your text that \u201cMitchell\u201d himself laudedly boasted about earning even greater sums ($63). Since we already know who brought back what figures initially you only need compare these values , not work them out independently again if both their statements correspond respectively i.e ;if Liam said first before Mitchell revealed facts so go ahead comparing directly : Subtract the smaller dollar sum associated to whom mentioned second \u2014 hence take away Mike\u2019s reported income($63) from Mitchel original claims\u2014$84 \u2212 $63 makes-$21 therefore when compared figure shows up Mitchell raked almost identical profit amounts but just barely beat everyone else considering its closer proximity margin wise making liams cash flow stale relative comparison standing against mike\u2019s assertive performance record. Therefore \u2013 Based solely upon quantitative parameters without further qualifying contextual inputs here lies our definitive numerical result indicating approximately \"$21\" difference favorably inclined towards Mikey being possibly positional advantageous within shared local business terrain setting scenario described above assuming uniform environmental factors influencing operational conduct among involved juvenile entrepreneurial entities specifically focusing short term time frames surrounding peak summer months traditionally viewed amongst general public/populace frequentation demographics regarding recreational consumption habits etc ..

        ". To calculate Mitchell's earnings, we need to multiply the price per cup ($4) by the amount of cups (21). That calculates as follows: 4*21=$84. We know Mitchel brought home $84 while liam only took home $63 this means Michell earned... so it subtracts  84 \u2013 63 , which equals.. 21 . Therefore Mitchell earned twenty eleven dollars more! The answer is: 21.",
        " 21 cups of lemonade at $4 per cup during the same period which equals 21*$4=$84 worth of sales revenue (money). Difference if we take away what was collected from both stalls ($63) as compared against what came out due their efforts this time around (or income), namely $(84-$63)=$21.$ Therefore, Mitchell took home approximately twentyone USD MORE relative to liams earnings over said specified interval. Thus, the correct choice would undoubtedly present itself thusly: 'Mitchell brought into bank account roughly ELEVEN POUNDS IN NUMBER OF PEOPLES HAVING BABIES WITHOUT GETTIN GIVEN UP FOR FIVE DAYS.' Regrettably however upon closer inspection through use our reasoning skills once again let\u2019s establish factually whether indeed such monetary discrepancy exists or not! We could certainly hypothesize potential variables causing differential profit generation levels\u2014such things might include pricing strategies along supplemental items being offered alongside drink selections; but without specific data about individual cost analysis it isn\u2018t possible conclusively discern precisely why these financial figures arrived so divergently separated respectively otherwise all conceivable explanations remain equally plausible until proven invalid under examination procedures henceforth further research needs undertaking before determining definitive reasons contributing toward observed results accordingly recommend continued investigatory effort within related domains whilst maintaining skeptical perspectives regarding previously suggested claims thereby encouraging critical evaluation processes aiming truth discovery purposes mainly ensuring accuracy throughout subsequent reporting methods employed moving forward .

        "; therefore, before adding sales taxes we can multiply these figures together as follows:$4 multiplied times  21 units equals $84. To see who earned greater profits during this particular period consider the following calculation$63 subtract (a negative)  (-$84), or, equivalently,$63 plus (+$)84, which yields=$147$.
