This results into sum up being same irrespective what type or quantity we choose if prices remains constant. Hence this means no difference exists under these circumstances! ",

Since both mixtures consist same amount of walnut($=~5), their prices differ solely based upon the proportion of Almond used up in them.(for first case=$5). But second consists $(((one fifth times price per lb)/two third parts of weight )+walnut portion i.e., ((5/(5/1))*(a quarter)+(five)).

        " this mix totals up to being worth $5 (for almonds) plus $5(walnuts), which comes out to $$10.$ Let\u2019s calculate our second batch! We only need half as many nuts because we weight them according to their quantity; meaning when you multiply both fractions, keep things proportional instead trying putting together whole pounds like before... This means.. Almonds still come down\u2026to just .$5x$. But since these new proportions add more volume overall let us also divide evenly among ourselves based off what amounts make sense ($($amount=$ amountofnewbatch)) And doing exactly here makes everything clearer too ;):=:$(.5=.5). Therefore.... All those pesky extra variables vanish!! Cost becomes equal regardless!. ",
        " mixture, similarly, calculate; you get (1 / 5) pounds of almonds which costs $(10)(1 / 5)$ = $<<1*10=2>>2$, and since walnuts don\u2019t change quantity here too just like before its weight remains $\\frac{1}{3}$ lb but price changes ,and thus costing $(\\frac{1} {3})(\\$15)$=$5$. Adding these together yields their combined overall amount as $($2 + 5$)=$ \"$<<2+5=7\"\". Therefore subtracting them finally leads us onto getting our desired result i.e., $[(7)-(10)]=-[$$ <<7-10=-3>>]$. However remember your question was asking about 'more', implying addition not subtraction henceforth reversing all signs obtained earlier above results into $-(-3)=3$ Dollars being exactly what additional sum requires over taking up said alternative choice compared to proceedings executed initially . Hence concluding upon receiving such answers always make sure if negatives arise during any calculations consider flipping those back around! ",
