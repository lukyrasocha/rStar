Since I cannot determine exactly since no specific value mentioned about halving yet without any information provided nor defined quantity regarding splitting into equal parts except using generic terms like \u2018halved.\u2019 Therefore assuming standard division based practices leading toward fair sharing or allocation such as cutting evenly among group recipients yields fractional results commonly observed; namely split items across pairs creating portions per pair(group).

Since it was divided up into whole units only without remainders,this result means there aren't any parts or fractions;it represents wholes exactly.
