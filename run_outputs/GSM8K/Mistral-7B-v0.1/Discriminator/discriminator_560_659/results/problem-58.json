Hence you get;  72\u201318=54 Seats Available Left Over( SAL) . Determine if parents take any seat using another fractional representation provided or not ? Yes , we can determine it because only parent attendance was quantified as well but indirectly through what proportion remains vacant after administration members filled their desired space ( which leaves half of those original 54 still unoccupied ). To calculate exactly how big portion went towards being claimed by pupils alone requires knowing specifically what percentile range fell within student occupation too! However simply calculating directly without further info about children attending could mean either estimating roughly equal numbers present among both population groups OR alternatively assume none yet due lacking certain data needed hereon hence making best estimate guesswork possible scenario rather precision measurement approach adopted above time wise saving effort involved instead practical use case solution finding methodology preferred under particular circumstances set forth throughout entire document including initial brief overview describing event subject itself earlier stated alongside subsequent following segments detail expandable information structure building progressive understanding complex topics inherently tied back together wholesomely thus forming cohesively integrated narrative thread linking various distinct parts related discussion points presented thereby reinforcing conceptually crucial themes explored thoroughly ensuring reader comprehension achieved satisfactorily upon conclusion completion full story summary summaries essential concepts necessary knowledge mastery ultimately allowing individual insight gained benefit resulting useful application learned skills helpful techniques utilized during process execution successful strategy development outcome derived positive impact experienced realm educational setting context pertinent discussed question posited originator inquiry addresser intent specified goal direction pursued sought accomplished intended result satisfaction desirable target objective fulfilled expectation met achievement realized anticipated hoped acquired gratification received reward fully appropriately earned merit finally concluded task completed adequately accomplishment made correctly executed mission objectives successfully implemented effectively carried out efficiently maximizing output delivered productivity increased quality enhanced efficiency augmentation results improved performance evaluated assessed accordingly grading system applied rating scale used scored marks assigned letter grades designated awarded certificates honored plaques conferred diplomas distinctions granted medals minted coins produced crafted items created artifacts inventoried cataloguing documented archive preserved stored secure kept records archived indexed organized sequenced sorted",
