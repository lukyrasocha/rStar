This can also bestow clarity over understanding which variable correlates directly proportional or inversely proportionately when compared against another; thus solving linear equations arising due mathematical operation performed sequentially while accountability remains intact among different parameters like 'hours spent,' etc., thereby culminating output values accurately expressed henceforth represented numerically depictive through algebraic expressions such fractional division along parallel lines visually implicative delineating correlation amongst mentioned constructible objects inherently associated within said quantitative exercise predicated underpins analytical reasoning skills essential towards facilitating overall cognitive maturation process encompassing both logical/spatial intelligence domains inclusively considered beneficial aspects development pertinent educational paradigms aimed primarily geared specifically designed objectives orientations accommodate differentiated learning styles leveraging holistic teaching methodologies engendering conducive environments promoting self-regulated learners equipped adept mechanisms critical thinking analysis interpretation model structuring inferential processes formulating conceptual frameworks synthesis design generation innovation creation transformational leadership mentorship strategies fostering scholar excellence aspirations lifelong learning mindset perpetuating individual potential realizing societal advancement uplifting community prosperities harmonious coexistence universal brotherhood peaceful resolution disputes conflict mediation arbitration justice equality solidarity empathy compassion humanism ethics moral philosophy virtues principles behavior conduct standards norms etiquette manners customary practices traditions folklore mythology legends tales storytellers songs ballads poetry verses rhymes stanzas poems epic odysseys chronicles histories narratives memoirs autobiographies biography authorial accounts literature bibliographic volumes textbooks curriculum guides syllabi course outlines class handouts lecture slides presenter speakers podiums bulletin boards posters flyers signage decor adornments d\u00e9cor motifs visual artwork sculptures statues monuments exhibits museum displays artifact collections antiques furnishings ornaments accessories attire garb apparel wearables",

Calculate according our results found previously here which tells us one would need $.60 dollar sales instead if you consider their change pricing structure. Hence answering 'yes'. Given these new values plugged into equation mentioned earlier:  2 * [10](qusteins)/hour * ${0.6}(cost /cup)= {12}($.).
