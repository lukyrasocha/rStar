Multiplying them numerically equates exactly our decimal calculation earlier because multiplying whole numbers yields same result when one factor contains only zeros while both factors remain positive integers.. Therefore,. This results in making \\$2,250 or choosing any other combination such as $\\frac{3}{10} \\times \\frac{75}{10}$ also resulting into dollar calculations like this:$(((3\u00d775)/(10\u00d710) =\\$, which implies if you divide your profit portion outright ($), instead of leaving partial units behind just ignore zeroes during multiplication operations even though all amounts seem very big but actually not , rather try breaking down large figures under simpler smaller segments until their relationship becomes obvious enough).. Hence overall whatever method suits better fits here .. But remember don't let extra digits complicate things unnecessarily !!! As long us using straight line algebra helps clarify steps easier than visual graphs etc.; go ahead doing either way! Or else prefer combining ratios together first before expanding anything further; sometimes less works great especially dealing w/$ variables right away without going through tedious divisions again\u2013like calculating percentages quickly afterwards once simplified forms obtained initially.. Also avoid writing redundant expressions whenever possible unless required specific context ; simple terms usually suffice most cases involving basic math concepts.-And lastly always double check every output carefully ensuring no mistakes made throughout entire computation process \u2013 keep track backward starting points till finish solving completely eliminating potential sources error altogether thus saving time spent worrying about accuracy levels later!.
