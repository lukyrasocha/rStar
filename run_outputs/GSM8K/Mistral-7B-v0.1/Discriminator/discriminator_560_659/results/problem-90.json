This means without any additional costs or fees (e.g., tax), it takes about 3 seconds longer than buying them at their original retail value since every dollar saved equates one second less time required compared to its initial cost (i.e, spending exactly as expensive initially indicates no savings translates into zero time saving) Hence, this was faster (since paying lower amounts implies being able to buy instantaneously rather than waiting extra due to having fewer coins / bills handy i.e speed equals inverse proportionality wrt monetary units involved ). However , if we consider sales tax based on local rates which average around 10 %, meaning roughly adding another ten percent charge onto already calculated base amount .

The difference in what was spent over these two occasions would thus be |398 - 540| dollars or just 142 dollars. This shows us whether spending power increased or decreased depending upon this situation. Here it appears that buying goods later when their price increases can still make sense as long as you get significant savings through other mechanisms like bulk sales quantity rebate programs etc., even if those seem relatively insignificant up front\u2014but one thing remains clear; without such special cases we cannot predictably claim otherwise!

However since this was purchased using coupons both ladies receive back seven hundred sixty cents or sixteen point eighty four percentage points less than normal which brings down what would\u2019ve ordinarily been seventeen dollar forty three amount instead to ten fifty one cents hence leaving just fifteen ninety nine if you subtract twenty altogether equals seventy seven thirty one dollars eighteen cents overall.

Therefore the final cost was less expensive this time due to the increased original base rate when purchasing again,$(-$100). However if you take into account their value overtime since she spent double initially instead only spending twice upon returning later despite having them worth so much(at least tripled),then its not even comparable nor true that one way would ever come up cheaper rather than all together being equal regardless considering current market conditions or otherwise taking into consideration any sort of inflationary effects etc.. Also keeping aside differences arising outta timing/purchase frequency , what matters most remains intact throughout different situations \u2013 whether buying things beforehand becomes pricier yet offering bigger bang;or selling higher right away still retaining similar values.(not affected by such factors either!)..This shows similarity across multiple scenarios occurring through various periods during these cycles within industry dynamics involving supply vs demand mechanisms\u2013whatever may happen overall benefits everyone involved equally while allowing businesses grow sustainably thus creating healthy competition amongst companies operating competitively amidst changing economic climate henceforth promoting innovation growth towards better services provided resulting positively impact society beyond short term gains generated primarily based solelyupon individual profit motives alone ..

Finally\u2014though not explicitly asked about initially \u2014subtraction across both purchases yields savings comparison; though these aren\u2019t strictly chronological as might seem logical due potential confusion regarding coupon vs overall sales reductions occurring simultaneously rather sequentially..

To find out what part my statement refers precisely let me clarify further.. With all factors considered including those listed here about buying quantities available vs desired quantity needed etc., one could conclude yes indeed shoppers who use promotions wisely tend towards net gain making decisions based upon individual consumption needs rather relying solely on perceived 'deals'.
