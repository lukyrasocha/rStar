Therefore multiplied amounts such as these indicate multiples or fractions depending upon context being discussed here : doubled instances yield twice as good results etc.; Multiplying times provides clarity regarding ratio comparison like comparing quantity vs quality issues , time savings against work intensity factors involved during decision choices made amongst consumers / suppliers alike..
