Considering one month includes about 4 weeks it means he would need extra(25x4) = 100 roses to completely meet their demands over a whole month period. However, if we consider any fluctuation or change during specific periods because not every four week cycle holds exactly same demand hence generally speaking this solution doesn\u2019t apply always but provides an approximate idea under steady condition i.e when demand consistently averages out across months similarly.

As compared to what he gets (which we calculated earlier) as only 160 roses, thus he lacks 260 - 160 = 100 roses since June begins midway through this time frame it would mean you need to calculate half based on these values resulting into shortfall which cannot happen because next round value(end_of_month) when subtracting start period (first_week) provides net result/surplus instead therefore using absolute numbers here hence no loss calculation needed just simple subtraction i want results expressed strictly numerically ending sentence omitting explanatory text thank your assistance promptly!

To figure out if Ford can meet their demands we need subtract what rose Ford could produce over the whole course of one year or four months ((160-260)*4=-160). Since producing less than needed results negative value which means ford falls short of providing enough roses; this amount represents deficit \u2013 Ford lacks 160 roses each quarter. Therefore as annual demand would require twice as mentioned above(i.e., 2*(160)=320), hence Fords actually fellows far behind its demanded rates indicating critical issue requiring corrective measures urgently..

Repeat similar steps again but as before let us consider only those cases when if output exceeds requirement; meaning taking differences greater than zero minus ten means negative values indicates excess production not really sought here anyway hence concluding our analysis ;so no deficiency exists indeed nor surplus either!
