Since 100g contains 3g of protein; hence 200 g would contain double that which equals  3x2=6grams. Multiply it across seven because there are seven days present in a standard week. That means the total amount consumable over such period comes as   6x7=42grams . Finally convert all amounts into appropriate units for clarity while stating your conclusion(no need here but generally important) Total weeks worth of proteins intake come out to about 42 grammes/week if someone consumes only these mentioned quantities.

Therefore multiply six grammes of Protein/mushroom-cup times seventh resulting which leads us back to thirty three . To conclude; if John consumes twenty parts worth of Mushrooms throughout those seven days period ,he ends up ingesting about sixty pounds equivalent nutrients including but not limited too like Carbohydrates fat etc\u2026so basically let\u2019s say half again around forty four depending upon what other sources maybe supplemental within diet plan designed especially catered towards healthy living overall well being maintenance hence increasing longevity thereby extending life expectancy accordingly reducing risks correlated associated medical conditions namely cardio related problems among several others also diminishing potential side effects linked specifically against specific medications prescribed often used during treatment course meant predominantly preventive measures rather than curative techniques utilized routinely applied scenarios generally occurrences arising occasionally sporadically happening rarely nonetheless significant nevertheless critical impact having direct consequence bearing profound ramifications implicated consequences directly relating primarily consequentiality affecting individuals holistically whole organisms complex system incorporating interconnected elements mutually dependent relying entirely reliance entirety contiguous uninterrupted continuum encompassment inclusivity coverage comprehensiveness totality summarily encapsulating synthesizing essence unity singularity homogeneity consistency congruency sameness agreement harmony accord concord coherence compatibility correspondence understanding meaningfulness significance importanceness value importance benefit usefulness utility practical application functionality effectiveness efficiency productivity quality standard excellence merit good practice commendation praise recognition reward achievement success result outcome conclusion bottom line determination definitive decision verdict judicious judgment sound advice prudent reasoning wise counsel advised direction guidance informed choice made decisions executed completed tasks accomplished objectives achieved goals attained desired results obtained positive outcomes realized gain realization satisfaction fulfillment pleasure joy contentment happiness cheer optimism enthusiasm confidence trust belief hope faith aspiration ambition motivation inspiration drive force spirit tenacity strength resilience courage bravery heroic heroine fortitude integrity honesty transparency",

Since Jhone takes in twice as many grams per meal\u2014i.e., twenty percent rather than ten percent \u2014he receives double those numbers when it comes time calculate calories consumed over multiple servings . Hence , if Johnny consumes X Gms ;his intake becomes X\u00b71=XGm during any single serving session while NN means consumption n times within seven consecutive weeks\u2019 cycles..Thus :P=(0.03)(NN)= WW+((0.03)(XX)))or simply ((1-(0.03n))xxxxx),with xx meaning \u201cequal\u201d because both numerator & denominator share units named \u2018protein amounts\u201d.

But here what am trying to find is actually not simply doubling.. Since this quantity contains several hundreds different molecules within itself too!!

Since a typical school year last about ten months (about 46 or so class sessions) multiply  6 by 46 since you assume all your classes meet once per month over these twenty six years. This comes out as around 276 grams of protein received throughout a whole average high school career! Thus my result would suggest someone might consume approximately twice their recommended dietary allowance during just eight hours worth (!!) Of course if asked specifically within normal human lifespans like say thirtyish people only live up till age seventy maybe something less closer too sixty percent rather than what i calculated...
