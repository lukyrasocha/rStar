Calculate weekend work separately first because we know if someone works once on both Saturday or Sunday, it counts towards one period (weekend) only. This means multiplying by another factor when calculating individual periods without summing them together; otherwise results become misleading due to doubling count since either condition would still require working those specific Saturdays & Sundays regardless of frequency within said pairing blocks. To calculate this scenario accurately involves recognizing such distinct segmentation during computation process while concurrent calculations may potentially confuse interpretation accuracy owing to compound counting discrepancies arising amidst simultaneous overlapping intervals like daily operations occurring across multiple adjacent temporal units yet necessitating isolationalized treatments sans additive redundancy inclusivity throughout aggregated periodic tallies resultingfrom cumulative quantification methodologies inherently intrinsic upon aggregate data amalgamations mandatory underpinning prevailing standard accounting protocol legislative frameworks upholding fiscal transparency standards thereby enforcing strict observance regulations promoting comprehensive consensus derived via unambiguously structured record scrutiny endeavors catered specifically addressing requisite analytical diligence demanded whilst deciphering complex multifactorial dynamics involving interdependent operational variables exhibiting cooperative interaction patterns influencingsymbiotic causal relationship matrices requiring meticulous interpretive schematization techniques applied judiciously conformantwith systematically organized information retrieval guidelines delineated forthwith henceforth facilitating precise procedural execution conducive enabling accurate diagnostic feedback loops yielding holistic integrative insight synthesis predicatedupon multi-dimensional cross section analysis paradigms fostering critical evaluative introspection grounding conclusions drawn ultimately harmoniously resonating synergistically reflective internal coherentity congruities manifestingly emblematic quintessential epitomical encapsulation ensuring optimal fruition optimality maximization efficiency potentiation strategies employed proactively preemptive anticipative circumvention adverse potential ramifications throughpreventatively informed prescriptive resolution formulation tactics effectively capitalizing situational dynamic fluxes leveraging timely opportunistic advantages exploitative initiatives propelling adaptable resource allocation maneuvers perpetually evolving contention adjustment modulators catalyzing continuous improvement progressiveness evolutionary trajectories advancing sustain",

Since both parties received same wages ; therefore their income differ only due hrs difference not rate !
