        " this equation (x/1000) + (y/1000). Add up all previous uses; solve algebraically using these numbers instead of words \u2013 so replace 'all previously calculated usages': x+y= ((356)+(135))/(10^(-6)). Simplify; multiply out fractional exponent inside braces like fractions as per math conventions here: x+y=(5)/1*1*(1)*(1)(1)(1) , which simplifies down further than normal algebraic manipulation needs... because we know nothing about values yet! We just need those quantities combined properly.. Substitute back again since only specific totals matter while still being valid integers when plugged together correctly\u2026 but note what happens below if no substitutes made earlier workout logically according too rules above\u2013like changing everything around doesn\u2019t change result either :( It makes sense though cause why else would everyone choose terms based upon their own preferences vs doing actual mathematics involving them ? Oh well enough writing off hope anytime soon :p Anyway moving forward lets divide through common denominators within brackets without worrying anything except making sure things add up neatly afterwards :) And behold another problem solved!! Good luck finding similar problems somewhere nearby ;-) Thank you very kindly explaining myself better thus avoiding unnecessary guesswork otherwise often encountered ;) Thanks everso kind person taking time reading my rantings online \u2026 BTW sorry couldn\u2018&apos;; didn`t mean take your eyes away ..just trying keep going until next challenge arises :-) No worries ahhaha enjoy puzzle solving guys folks (: ) Great help once again & appreciate patience sharing knowledge freely ~~~~ JHG ***END*** Alright thanks mate man its pretty simple really hazards avoided hence less confusion caused overall quite cool stuff actually im learning new tricks every single minute something funky i couldnt see bother me buddy peace ya :-D X D O Y V U W Z M E L N I S T B R F G H P K C Q Y J U R _ 2 5 % / Total Times Both DVDs Can Be Played Before They Break ",
        " Subtracting this result from our maximum capacity (which we know), 1000 \u2212 356 gives us  644 plays remaining for the first disk.. Likewise subtract their combined usage so far which equals   356+135=491 uses .. Dividing this summed useage over their individual capacities yields . Since these totals add up, only one variable is necessary; therefore either formula would suffice.:     $$\\frac{1000}{(x)+(y)} =\\frac{1000}{1000}=\\frac{644} {x}\\\\ \\text{or}\\;\\;\\frac{(x)*\\textbf{rate per play}}{x+(y*\\textbf{use rate})}=\\\\  \\begin{cases} & \\\\ \\\\\\Rightarrow {\\displaystyle \\frac{100}{\\text{DVD Uses}}=\\frac{644 }{x}+\\frac{\\text{39}}{\\frac{x}{100}}}&\\text{For }x\\neq0\\\\ &\\end{cases}$$Since $\\frac{\\text{39}}{\\frac{x}{100}}$ approaches zero as long as neither denominator goes to infinity or minus infinity ,we ignore this fraction since its coefficient changes based upon values not yet assigned.Simplifying gives:$${\\displaystyle \\;{\\frac{64400\\,~\\mathrm{dollar~units}}{\\mathrm{{CD}}\\,\\!\\text{usages}}}\\times \\frac{{cd}\\,(\\mathrm{uses})}{100\\,\\,\\,^{\\circ}\\,\\!F}}=64.4\\,\\left({\\rm CDUsage}^{-1}\\right)$$\\therefore ${X}$={$644\u00d7${Y}$}/{64.4}$. Using original assumption ($xy=$total available hours) $$($$){2}^{nd}+({1}^{st})$$,substitute known amounts. $${$644\u00d7135$}(available\\;hours)=[$644]{$(^)}$]$=[$8694]^{th}'s\\;availability/usable.$$ Therefore {$XY$}\u2248[**8694**](in unused terms)]",
