That leaves sixteen divisible numbers eight including ourselves : [ 8, 16] Which becomes eleven Removing seventeen would yield only seven available possibilities leaving us stuck:(or maybe shuffled around enough until finding no matches just like I said earlier)(so remove Eight,(because both previous answers included Six),(and eliminate Seven since removing thirtyfour still yields negative options)(only option being Nine.)
