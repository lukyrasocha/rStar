Finally, calculate the approximate value required \u2013 multiply the previous result by 44 resulting in ('a very large', or roughly equivalent to): 44 * 20 \u2248 880 pounds. However, considering real world situations, such extreme values might not always represent actual quantities due to biological limitations like species size & dietary needs among others.

        " the weight of the Dachshund or (20/4) = 5 pounds. Finally, calculate the weight of the Mastiff. Its weight equals fourteen times the summed weight of all preceding animals because since we calculated up until here; therefore, calculating this results into 2(Dakshund)=weight*4= 14*Weight_Affenpinschers+Papillons). Which simplifies down further when you substitute values already obtained so far:  14*(10+20+5), ultimately resulting in a value equivalent to Weight_Mastiff. This comes out being equal to (39)*14 = 546. Thus, the solution concludes that based on provided relationships amongst weights across different breeds listed beforehand if their relationship continued similarly such calculations could theoretically follow suit but without concrete relational data available these particular statements seem abstract conjecture rather than factual evidence yielding mathematical validity.

Substituting known value:`papillon_weight =20lbs/(4)`;i.e.`papillon_weight=  5lb`.
