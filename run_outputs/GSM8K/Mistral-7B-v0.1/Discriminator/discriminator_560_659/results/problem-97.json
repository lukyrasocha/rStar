To figure out maintenance expenses throughout the first year we need to take into account not only storage charges but also running charge; Fuel costs are double rental fees , i.e., $(5000*2)x12$=$120,000$. Add together these three numbers ; summing them all leads us to Total Yearly Cost : Initial Purchase+Storage Expenditure+$Maintainance Fees=(initial purchase)+(storage expense)+($fuel fee)=${150,000}+{60,000}+{120,000}=$ {330,000}.

Hence, calculate summed totals ((Initial Purchase Price)+(Rent X 1 Year Total))+((Fuel Usage Per Month)*(Month Count)), resulting into ((150,000)+($5000*12))+(2*$5000*12)= $(150,000)+($60,000)+($120,000)=$330,000 spent over course of entire first operational cycle annually.[[$",
        " James spent twice as much as the hanger payment (which is $5000) on fuel every month so this equates to $5000*2=$<<5000*2=10000>>10,000. Multiply these values together ($150,000+$5000x12+($10,000*$12))=(150,000+(5000*12)+(10,000*12)). This results in ((150000+(5000)*12)+((10000)*12)=$232,000). Therefore, It would amount to $\\boxed{\\text{D}}$. That means over one fiscal period... or annual timeframe\u2026the maintenance expenses come out quite high.. Thus making option D incorrect because we need only add them all up which equals $$232,000.$ We find none matches exactly our calculated sum....so let us try again:$150,000+\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)(2)\\cdot\\color{",
        " $5000 which equals $10,000 on fuel every month. Add up all these expenses over one year (which consists of 12 months). Total annual fees would include purchase price plus hanger rental ($5000x12) + fuel($10,000x12). This calculates into $150,000+ $60,000+$120,000=$330,000. Therefore, it took James $330,000 USD to buy and maintain the airplane during its first full calendar year. The answer is: 330000.",
        " hanger over one year. Multiply the monthly rental fee ($5000) by 12 (months), resulting in $60,000 annually. Add this amount up together with half-year fuel expenses\u2014it amounts to ($60,000 / 2 )= $30,000 spent on fuel within six months or twelve payments worth totals $((5000+10000)*12)=$180,000 .Finally , find out what sum you need altogether to spend upon obtaining these properties considering all their acquisition fees($=Cost\\ of \\plane +\\ Cost\\of\\Rent+\\Fuel$). Adding them results into equal value=$150,000+$60,000+$180,000=-$490,000 This outcome can\u2019t happen because we cannot owe negative funds so lets reconsider calculations.. Since maintenance fuelling was asked about only those paid every month while purchase wasn\u2019t included thus its not cumulative; calculate directly instead using formula Total Yearly Expense=[Purchase Amount+(Monthly Rent*12)+ ((Twice Monthly Fuel Cost Per Annum)]TotalYearExpense[=(No Purchase)(renter rate*(noOfPaymentPerAnn))+((fuelRateAmont*NoOfTimesPaidInOneAnnth))]Substitute known quantities:$totalYearlyMaintenanceCharges[$-( no purchase*$rentalrate/ No Of payment per annih) + ($twice fuelcharge*payment frequency per years]/$(-(0) * (.50*.00euro)*12$) +($(1euro*amounttimesperani))$-$(0*(halfpriceforannualfeetiarypurchased)$)-$(doublefueltimespananni))-$($totalfuelspentaune))$ Simplify expression & evaluate:$totalYearlyCharges[-(.50\u20ac)*12]+[(1euro)*amounttimeperane]*2 [As twicemoneywillbepaidedifthereisnofuelfee]=0 +[(1euro)*amounnttimetimepayeredinaintozero][asthreerateforallamenitiescostswillalwaysequalsoutprinciplecost]$final"
