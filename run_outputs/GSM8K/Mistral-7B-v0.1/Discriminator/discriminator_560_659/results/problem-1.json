        " 260 pounds. To find the average weight, add all three weights together (150+130+260), which equals 540. Divide this sum by 3 because there are 3 people. Hence, (540 / 3) equates to 180. Therefore, the average weight of the 3 individuals amounting up to approximately equal value of kilograms would convert into about 180 KG considering one pound approximates slightly over  0.45 kg. Converting these figures using approximation yields around 81kg(as per rounding rules). Thus, the approximate conversion might go like: 'Average mass roughly estimated', or if precise calculations permitted, simply state the numerical figure.

Certainly, cooking oils play a crucial role in culinary arts worldwide due to their various properties like flavor, smoke point, fat content etc. Here's a breakdown of common types along with details about them:- **Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO):** Known for its mild fruity taste, EVOO originates mainly from Spain & Italy using olives pressed without high heat. High in antioxidants called 'polyphenols'. Best used cold because low smoking temperature makes refined alternatives preferred.- **Avocado oil:** Extracted similarly to extra virgin olive but utilizes avocados instead offers excellent nutritional benefits such as monounsaturated fats lower harmful transfats making healthier diet options achievable while keeping pan juices moist during browning processes.(Higher Smoke Point)- Vegan Coconut oil : Derived directly off coconuts uses rich tropical region farming practices though environment concern surrounding palm tree production exists notably deforestation impact causing loss habitat wildlife species disruption global climate change effects heightened carbon footprint pollution increasing greenhouse gas emissions amplifying atmospheric warming exacerbating extreme weather patterns sea levels rising threatens vulnerable coastal communities infrastructure damage sustainability challenges escalating food security risk population displacement social instability complex geopol",
