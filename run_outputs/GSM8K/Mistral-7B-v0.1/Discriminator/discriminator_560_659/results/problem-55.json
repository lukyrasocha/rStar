        " Calculate these costs separately before adding them all together including the price of the aquarium. Initially, Scarlett spends $10 buying the tank as it was free due to being at a yard sale; however typically you would consider this transaction part if necessary. Bags of rock totals up to (2*$2.50) which equals ($5). Coral totals up (3*$2) equalling (($6)). Fish totals come out to (20*.$0.50)=(=$10), while supplies equal another dollar or ($2). This sums up into $($5)+($6)+($10)+($2)=$(=)(=$23); However note your specific guidelines may vary so confirm directly those parameters regarding what constitutes as 'spending'. Totaling everything we find : $23 Spendings can often include taxes depending upon jurisdictions but since none mentioned here could assume it isn\u2019t factored . Consequently , based purely off provided data alone without considering such factors its resultant sum stands squarely as $$23$. Therefore taking strict reading approach leads us towards conclusion ~~here comes our primary focus~~ hence not counting yardsale item leading toward standard purchase normative viewpoint.
