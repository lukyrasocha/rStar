You didn't mention when exactly these events occurred during any particular week but seems like one thing leads another\u2026how would those hours look compared versus all your expenses ? Doesn't seem relevant here considering only amounts mentioned above regarding spendings within specific time periods along wich no other additional info provided apart general statement saying \u201deveryone wants maximum utilization.\u201d But anyway continuing further ;)..now onto calculating whatever amount remains following yesterday s session \u2026 ok well i know my friends usually work out daily yet imo shouldn \u2019 m too lazy sometimes(easier said than practice?)
