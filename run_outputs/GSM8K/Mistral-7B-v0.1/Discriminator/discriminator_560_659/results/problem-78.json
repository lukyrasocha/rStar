After every third week, he changes his route according to specific rules based on weather conditions which affect travel times as follows: Route R takes half of its usual duration if it rains; however, doubling when very windy. Route S triples durations during heavy traffic but halves otherwise. Route T remains unchanged unless under snowfall twice within the trip period, adding another hour per occurrence. During normal seasons without any special condition, these respective base durations apply over three consecutive weeks until alteration due to adverse effects occur: Routes R/S/T take up respectively 'a', b hours'. Knowing the average speeds vR=12mph, vS=15mph and vs=10mph for their standard routing scenarios\u2014and using miles instead of minutes\u2014calculate the extra hours spent yearning through varied roads annually excluding periods affected directly by extreme circumstances like snows fallings requiring detours not factored hereunder nor including leap years impact considerations.

Therefore, it means all together he\u2019d want to buy eight items ((Apple* quantity=price)(orange*quantity=price)) so using these identifiers identify their respective values [(apple*(cost_per_item))]+(Orange[(cost_per_item)*]), substituting our preliminary calculations into them; We finally solve : [($1.30]*(5+1)] + [($1.10]*((5)/(3)). First resolving inner bracket calculation gets us -> ([$1.30]*.60) + .[$.10].

Add these together so you find out what ten fruit would set one back. Hence; summing up your previous operations equals...$6.5+$5.75=$12.25.
