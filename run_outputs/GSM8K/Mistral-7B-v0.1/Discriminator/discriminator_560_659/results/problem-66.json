Another thing worth mentioning concerning above method applied : Time variables only get introduced later during manipulation process therefore shouldn&apostmaintain separate trackings until combining those different aspects !!! It really depends upon usage cases albeit common ones usually favor simplicity while ensuring necessary precision isnot neglected..

But if you strictly want your answer solely expressed within original unit parameters without any conversions applied \u2014 such as Kilobytes Per Second ('Kbps') initially presented here but seeking something like bytes(Bytes)/Seconds('Byt/Sec'); converting kilobits(Kb) back to Bytes reveals that indeed 1 byte equals roughly .008 Kb therefore resulting ultimately being around 2.4 megaBytes/hr under classic English convention usage considering all these factors collectively \u2013 note though whether someone refers directly only onto terms ending '.mB', typically implies understanding referring specifically towards larger scale than minute details oneself might wish otherwise interpret differently based upon intended contextual comprehension scope etc.).

        " bps (bits per seconds). One minute consists of 60 seconds therefore one min contains 20000*60 bits i.e., 1200000 bit/minute or 1.2 megaBit(Mbit) since it already said about million we need not add any zeroes here so this means if you look above calculation I multiplied my byte rate times sixty because I wanted bytes per SECOND but really was calculating BytePerMinutes actually just multiply your byteRate X TimeInSecond . This formula can also help calculate anything similar like our problem , example what would Mike s driving Speed be knowing distance covered miles traveled hours drove : MilesTraveled / HoursGivenHere using same concept as mine previously discussed only thing needs changed its unit into KilometersNotice difference kilometers & milessince km=1000mvsmdistancebetweentwocitiesisinkmnowusethisformulaToGetAnnspeedseccondlyaddKilometrageforEverySecoundNowmultiplyingwith6oftimeconversionfactorintoHoursofDaytoFindTotalKiloDistanceCollectTrukTime&FinallyConvertingBackMillisecondandCalculateSecondsthenBitsMultiplicationordivisionusingfactorsgives",
        " into bps (bits per second), we get 20 * 1000= 20000 bits/second; since you need to convert it furthermore back into Bytes instead o",
        " convert bits into bytes first so we divide our result below through four since one byte consists of eight bits. That means 20,000 / 8 = 2500 bytes every second or bps(bits Per Second), because kilo stands for thousand only while mega refers to million things hence we multiply it also as follows...which results finally in 20 * 60 seconds multiplied by 60 minutes, making it equal to ...20KB PS -> 24MbPS, considering that Mega symbolizes Millions not thousands like Kil represents Thousands..That makes your Internet Speed  24MBitPerSec ~= 24*Hour ===> Approx. Total amount around here would roughly translate about approx **1728 Megabytes** if this calculation was accurate !!!! "
