That makes them collectively contribute sixfold quantities i.e., Six sets combining Judy's & Friend's products respectively which translates into contributing doubled product collections altogether since multiplication laws work likewise across multiple grouping contexts justifying \u201csix\u201d represents doubling herein due its implications against the base judiciary offerings only inclusive within one collection or group scope .

According to the question, it was mentioned that her friend arrived with four times fewer (which translates to one fourth) cups compared to what we know she purchased i.e., Fourth part of twelve equals three so judging solely using this information would imply sixteen while assuming half of them equal eight but if you use simple math division like dividing numerator over denominator such here since both numbers appear before operation marking addition or subtraction indicating multiplication hence sixty divided forty yields fifteen therefore adding up all their amounts twenty seven(dividend plus quotient together creates dividend thus combining our calculations).
