Hence, as the resultant amount becomes lesser while dealing with weights used during strength training sessions, we subtract the difference; i.e., currently, Jamaal opts to workout with a combined mass of 12\u22122=10 pound(lbs.)

His original increase was wrong because it made this amount even heavier. Therefore we need less, not more; We subtract instead. Two pound makes it easier still but if you consider everything together it would mean initial calculation was incorrect.. Correcting himself, one needs only add those same four additional pounds directly onto their existing eight-pound load since increasing beyond them doesn\u2019t make sense here due to unintended complexity caused when adding percentages before realizing overweight resulted.
