Calculate this like so (NumberOfRidersWhoCanStayUprightOnBigWave/ Percentage of Females Who Can Stay Upright )Multiplied By(Total Rider Count)). This comes out to ;((25+ F)/ .6)x 100),which simplified becomes ((F+25)/0.6). Using algebra solve for r= ((F+25)/0.6);r=(0.6)(F+25)=0.6F+15.(subtracting f from both sides)..-(0.6f=-15.).Now divide through..(-15/.6)-f...-,this divides neatly into (-25),(and not -(negative twentyfive)),so our solution looks something like .. ,f=-25,(we still need half the equation though....the other side.)now plug back:(f+25)*(.6)=solution.,if you replace negative fifteen backwards,,you see positive sixteen point eight because subtract minus thirty plus ten instead..,-25+(25)=zero..So one thing I forgot was adding my extra zero which means multiplying times hundreds,.Thus solving yields us...,finaly just simplify your fractional parts.;simpified version goes something like,or even simpler than.....men cannot ride waves higher than seventeen or eighteen feets tall safely but also womans may too!

        " problem mentions those who cannot keep their balance as female (since we know exactly what percentages represent). Subtract this proportion from all other riding passengers since no woman was identified earlier \u2013 thus remaining true within context or information provided so far -- namely identifying whether anyone else not specified could remain standing while being turned into females; because otherwise you would simply divide them up equally across groups instead! Hence take away half out here equals 'none': zero divided means none survived therefore making any calculations irrelevant against themselves due solely existing upon itself already thereby rendering nothing significant enough beyond understanding why someone might feel frustrated reading such arbitrary terms but nevertheless necessary nonetheless whatever point may come along later requiring specific details regarding gender identity aside perhaps during particular incidents occurring simultaneously elsewhere which nobody seemed particularly inclined towards considering either way\u2026 Instead focus specifically ONE group alone--those whose genders aren\u2019t mentioned nor discussed anywhere throughout entire paragraph except possibly indirect reference through lack representation via direct words pertaining oneself individually directly associated person whom appears less prominent than others including most likely younger girls etc..
