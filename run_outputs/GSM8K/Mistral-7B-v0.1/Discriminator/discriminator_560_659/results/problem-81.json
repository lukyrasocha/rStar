Add this additional amount onto our prior knowledge about pre-promotion earnings i.e., $240000+$12000=$252000 Annual Salary Post Promotion Thus add up one quarter paycheck\u2019s value since tim receives three quarters extra every time if you take off 1 payment period because its semiannually here hence subtracting twelve thousand(half of $24000)$x$original_salary/$month=two years($2\\cdot twelvemonthesince $(paymentperiod)here equals six.$",

Additionally, Tim receives another half-month salary as a bonus every time this increase occurs, so it would add up to 21000/2 =<<21000/2=10500>>$10500 annually when both increases combine together. Adding these amounts over twelve months ((12)*[($21000+$10500))], we find out that Tim makes [(12*(21000+10500)] or approximately <<12*(21000+(10500*2))=287000>>$287000 during one calendar year under such promotional offer conditions if all remain constant throughout his employment tenure without considering factors like taxes etc..
