Firstly since both Nickle Coin types combined only make up about half of the overall Monetary value needed ($1), thus reducing them could result leaving less actual monetic value remaining when converted back down i.e.: Half being reduced vs Quarters as well reduces its own halved size compared against original full values hence why not just say reduce/halfing etc instead unless specifically instructed otherwise ie; Reduce(Total Money Amount). However even without such reductions happening still no real way seems possible because despite having enough individual amounts already present within current holdings via said breakdown above yet need somehow gain access totals greater than initial starting points here alone while nothing adds onto previously stated quantities either due lack options available amongst currently accessible means whilst maintaining prior balance intact thereby showing potential deficiencies furthermore possibly creating inconsistencies elsewhere related directly associated areas perhaps indirect connections tied loosely connecting together depending upon specific circumstances encountered during usage scenarios mentioned earlier leading towards unforeseen outcomes especially considering factual implications arising subsequent developments involving factors external influencing dynamics observed respectively affecting overarching system behaviors occurring throughout existence spanning multiple generations consequently causing variations across spectrum boundaries typically viewed primarily influenced through direct associations established based largely dependent relationship forms derived predominantly anchored mainly around key structural determinants dictated chiefly pertaining core foundational underpinnings underlying fundamental design principles utilized implementing comprehensive approaches applied globally adhering closely resembling universal standards recognized worldwide incorporating respective adjustments applicable whenever necessary taking appropriate measures ensuring optimal performance levels achieved consistently irrespective fluctuation conditions experienced regularly amidst diverse applications implemented universally therefore providing highest level capabilities delivered effectively achieving maximum efficiency output efficiently maximizing productivity yield simultaneously minimizing",

Convert all amounts into single unit so it would easier ; if we convert everything to decimal equivalent let us use dollar value here since its common denominator among them; Quarter(s)=$.25*8=$2.00 Dimes=$.10*6=$0.60 Nickels=.05*14=$0.70 Pennies=(.$0.01*15)$=.$0.15 Total up these amount which colby possess :$2+$0.60+$0.70+$0.15summing this makes him possesses,$3.45 This means ,he could purchase three full rounds($3*)each consisting six items(*for example)*nine(.05$)gumball per round making ninety gumblabs overall*.So finally count your remaining balance:$3.45-$3.=$.45Remember you cannot exchange $.45into any other coin combination without acquiring/dropping change..
