Also note one other aspect mentioned very clearly about directionality being important since things move north towards magnetic south etc.: This affects us only if considering celestial objects rather than terrestrial ones because once observed via telescopes their directions seem pretty constant despite fact Earth rotating/orbiting every second changing coordinates slightly otherwise invisible though visible effect could occur even minute later like light delay causing apparent motion too slowly making astronomy difficult without correct corrections applied appropriately(which may vary based individual needs & locations)\u2013i suppose anyway ;) Well enough theory let go technical stuff :P Oh well\u2026so coming back soon hopefully ;p Alright!
