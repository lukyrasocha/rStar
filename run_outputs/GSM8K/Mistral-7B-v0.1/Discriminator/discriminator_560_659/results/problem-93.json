Hence, $80%$. That amount constitutes roughly one third. I guess people who go through things like these lose their minds thinking about percentages! They all seem very complicated when you first hear them but once again just remember your basics math skills here :) It really isn't hard!! Let me breakdown my reasoning though... Considering dollar amounts without doing anything fancy or using any formulas; This equation represents our situation right above \"$x\\%=\\dfrac {\\text{whatever %}} \\text {of whole}\" Well basically knowing both parts lets find out the missing part ($w$)... But hold up.. As stated earlier consider trying something easier than calculating %, maybe breaking down percentage based equations involving different scenarios could work too.....But considering realistic numbers such as time vs distance etc., probably best dealing directly with base quantities involved.(i mean why complicate matters?) Remember its called simple interest therefore whatever rate applied won't change during duration meaning only principal needs adjustment accordingly $(P+rT)$. Good luck solving problems regarding finance especially those implying rates Of course everyone might say 'Hey look im being silly!' However dont mind me ;-) , i am rather having fun myself understanding theories related mathematics....Think along these lines next : $$\\begin{align*}\\frac{a}b+\\frac ab &=c\\\\\\Rightarrow b(ac+bc)=ab^2\\\\\\Rightarrow c&=\\frac{ab}{b(a+b)}=\\frac a{(a+b)}\\end{align*} $$ Note however this solution involves high level algebra whereas mine stayed simpler since dividing/subtracting terms usually provides sufficient answers sometimes even saving computation power!...So ultimately decisions boil down personal preference according individuals inclination towards problem setting prioritizing easy digestible content over complex ones unless instructor insists otherwise ;) .Goodluck fellow reader :-) Any further assistance feel free share ur thoughts via comments~ Bye !
