Here we need the smallest whole number value when `initial_height doubled enough time(days)` reaches past 20 meters high; i.e., When (`4*2^X >=`)20 . To solve this exponential inequality divide both sides of equation firstly by four `[=]`(`   X >= )5/2`. This indicates X > approximately half way through fifth day.
