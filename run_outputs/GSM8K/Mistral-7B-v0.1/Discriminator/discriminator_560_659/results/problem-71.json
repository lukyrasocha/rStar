Given that its cost is \"$400 less\" compared to Gold; this makes the Price equal to $1600 \u2013$400 = $1200. Lastly calculate their Total Cost by adding up these prices together i.e., Diamonds ($2000)+Gold($1600)+Silver ($1200), hence Summed Value= $2000+1600+$1200=$4800. Therefore, the overall worth or sumtotal amount being asked about here totals out to Forty Eight Hundred Dollars(i.e.$4800).

Accordingly, since its stated that a Silver Jewell would cost $400 cheaper, subtracting the mentioned amount off the original Gold Price calculated before which was equal to '$1600', you get your resultant figure. We deduct '(\u2212$400)' onto ('+$1600'). Therefore making another multiplication operation equivalent to (+($1600)$+(-($400)).
