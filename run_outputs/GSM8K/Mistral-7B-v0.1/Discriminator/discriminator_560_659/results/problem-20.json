To find out the correct setting needed to reach 520\u00b0F as per original requirement, decrease 520 by 4%, calculated using arithmetic operation [(original temp)(1-(error rate))]. Therefore compute [520*(1-0.04)] resulting into approximately  499.2. Hence consider round figure upwards or downward depending upon your preference, rounded value comes nearly about\u00a0499\u2109~. But since no specific mention was made over 'how accurate,' we could say exact degree not required here considering usual household thermometer tolerance range might suit better around ~500 \u2109. Still taking consideration precision important like bakery professionals follow meticulously while working so you can add little extra(say less than half) towards target aim i.e approx above 500 instead settling directly onto marked reading further check cook readiness via trial test etc..
