        " $3 each which amounts to 9*3=<<9*3=27>>27 dollars. Similarly calculate the cost for the basketball coach who bought 8 basketballs at $14 each adding up to 8*14= <<8*14=112>>112 dollars per set or type ball. To find out how much more one person (in this case the Basketball Coach) spends compared to another i.e., Baseball team we subtract the lesser value from higher : Therefore it would come as follows; More expenses = Cost(Basketball Team)-Cost(Baseball Team)= 112-(27)$=$85$ . Hence, if you compare their costs, the Basketball head coached paid \"$\"$85$$moreforallhepurchasethanthembasichteachdid. ",
        ". Next calculate the amount spent by the basketball coach on the basketballs. Basketball was purchased eight times as expensive i.e., costing $14/ball which totals (8*14) $112 over all seven years since both boys played every week throughout their entire seasons until graduation high school or college(higher education). But you only need half those prices because one would assume fewer games mean less wear & tear thus reducing maintenance costs so divide this figure in halves getting ($112 / 2), resulting into$56 saved annually due presumably better care taken during youth playing period leading up towards adulthood post educational attainment but before starting professional career paths \u2013\u2013-$39 still needs payments considering reduced expenses compared earlier mentioned higher rate associated wages required among competitive sportspersons . Therefore finally consider subtraction operation indicating difference namely:$39($subtract initial outgoings)(difference)$=(-$27+(total))+|negative sign (+)|$-6$(positive sign (-)).

To find out who spent more we need to subtract what the baseball coach paid from what the basketball coach paid (since it states 'how much MORE').
