        " - 3 = 2 cards. Together they have 5 (the boy) plus 2 (his brother), which makes 5 + 2 = 7 cards altogether. The answer is: 7.",
        " both boys\u2019 card sums up 5 (boy) + 2 (brother) which equals to 7 cards altogether. Therefore, their combined count totals out as 7. ",
        " boy has 5 cards. Combine their totals by adding them up as follows : 5 (the first quantity) plus 2 (second quantity). Therefore it means we need to add these quantities . Add using mental math methods or strategies your choice here , but remember no calculator was used only addition rules you learned like 'when both numbers being added start greater than zero I use counting principles'. You would say this simply takes me three counts into considering ones digits \u2013 not hundreds place which isn\u2019t really what\u2019s happening yet! Next consider tens; since none go past seven when combined such pairing works well because one won't reach ten without having extra space above six therefore keeping things simple until next stage while still maintainng accuracy within limits set forth earlier(see paragraph below.) Hence four times equals eight thus yield=eight altogether meaning collectively those duo individuals possess equal sum fifteenfold per item measure overall including multiplicand entities amongst multiple factors simultaneously due largely upon factorization involving grouping aspects etcetera thereby rendering lessenable results otherwise attainable via conventional procedures albeit simpler methodologies exist nonetheless requiring additional steps prior multiplication operations hence unnecessary efforts avoidance possible through alternative approaches employed elsewhere across varying context domains specifically academic settings particularly mathematics education curriculum developed around current international standards governing core literacy competencies required universally among diverse learner population ranging youngsters adult educators profession teachers students parents caregivers society community members inclusive every individual participating throughout globalized interconnected worldwide systems integrative paradigms incorporated educational practices aimed facilitating seamless acquisition comprehensive learning frameworks based humanistic values promoting harmonious intellectual cooperation fostering peaceful communal existence amidst increasingly intricate technological advancements ensuring sustained societal development towards equitable distribution resources whilst preserving environment health safeguarding fundamental rights entrenching civil liberties democratic institutions champion justice equality tolerance religious freedom ethical conduct responsible stewardship public accountability transparency civic engagement empowerment citizen participation encouragement grassroots activism campaign movements social change reform advocacy lobbying policy making decision analysis data driven research findings applied sciences engineering technology innovation breakthrough discoveries novel insights creative thinking process generating new ideas inspiring entrepreneurial spirit spark leading visionary leadership mentoring role model character strength determination resilience adaptability flexibility optimizing opportunities realising potential achieving goals overcoming obst",
        " of cards the man\u2019s brohter owns (from Step 1) which was equal to 2 . This means you get  5 \u2013 2=<|end_of_document|> 3 . Together ,they therefore possess 5+3 or sixteen cards all told.. As we calculated earlier,,the boys brothers card count equals three hence if this amount totals ten it would mean their combined sum comes out as fourteen but unfortunately I don't understand what else might make your solution differ because adding our initial numbers results us into having fifteen altogether though technically my previous explanation resulted me ending up subtracting just one less meaning eleven instead since i miscalculated something .. maybe double check again please ???? Also note both children may only play poker individually without sharing! And remember playing poker isn't about buying new ones either ;-) Hopefully these help clarify things further :) But ultimately still aiming towards getting exactly sixty eight using basic math skills alone unless otherwise requested later down line... Let ' s go through everyone involved here once again : First off lets identify who plays along namely ourselves besides possible others known commonly throughout history such Abraham Lincoln whose nickname could easily refer themselves indirectly back onto John Adams whom probably didnnt like being called America before him even thought most folks say its really fun telling stories around campfires etc due mostly historical accuracy vs modern times storyline changes plus other similarities seen among friends/acquaintances when describing events occurring during life span especially those relatable enough often considered essential parts whilst living forever amongst humanity itself ! Therefore taking everything above mentioned considering current situation against past lives lived across several generations while maintaining realistic expectancy regarding behavior patterns displayed versus expected normative standards set forth various decades ago thus ensuring accurate portrayal regardless era origin whether prehistoric mammoth hunting trips via cave paintings found worldwide showing signs indicative existence prior discovery nor simple coincidence merely mere assumption made based upon common understanding shared within popular culture circles associated generally speaking anthropologists studying related subjects primarily archaeology geography linguistics sociology ethnology psychology religion mythoetics philosophy physics chemistry biological systems evolution astronomy celestial mechanics planetary science stellar dynamics nebular theory galactic formation astrophysics atomic structure nuclear physiology biochemistry molecular genetics genomics proteomics transcriptomics immunogenetics gene expression metagenomic bacteri"
