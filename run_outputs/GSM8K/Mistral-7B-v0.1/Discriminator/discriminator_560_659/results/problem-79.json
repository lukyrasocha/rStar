Therefore it would actually only require ten whole portions per square meter as opposed to fifteen before considering efficiency; however taking those numbers modulo thirty makes our math easy because anything above sixty gets counted multiple times but not any less than fifty due divisibility rules dictate both factors being equal yield zero remainder upon division therefore simplifying calculations further still lets us simply divide remaining quantities directly without having go through complex steps previously used otherwise necessary once results approached higher values beyond six hundred forty four point nineteen eight seven percent completion barrier whilst applying said principle here merely allows quicker computations rather relying exclusively solely factorization techniques employed earlier described hence avoiding unnecessary computation altogether resulting exactly equally beneficial solution compared latter mentioned primarily focused purely quantitative analysis requiring greater computational efforts involving additional formulas specifically designed such logic sequence determining optimal resolution method applied whenever confronted circumstances present themselves thus necessitating utilizing specific approaches derived thereby achieving accuracy despite inherent difficulty surrounding numerous variables involved within real world applications particularly problem solving tasks associated mathematics topics concerning geometry including finding dimensions measurements among several others examples include area calculation etc..

Multiply this figure by time taken per unit volume \u2013 so if Bob can work through one cubic foot every three seconds, working full speed means; Time taken would equal Total volume/Unit rate , thus T(seconds)=V/(time to shift soil per cubic ft).

Multiply all those together when finding volumes including rates such things! And finally convert results back into desired output form--time here meaning 'seconds'.
