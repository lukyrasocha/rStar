Given here : Distance(D)=75miles , Speed Ratio =Speed_tom / Speed_bob=(Tom\u2019s)   70/(55+70), thus Time required = D*SR      =>       75*(70)/(55+70) hours     equals      4500/125   which simplifies downto         36 Hours It takes around thirty six hrs if tom drives continuously without any break till reaches bob.(Because normally people would prefer breaks during such lengthy trips).

Since both drivers travel at constant rates, this equation relates time directly to rate change over difference in distances covered when applied repeatedly until reaching zero distance differences or unit separation respectively. As you may know already...but here again just so everyone knows why your formula works everytime! Formula derived using equations involving variables representing quantities such as 'rate', which represents motion through space along linear paths;distance expressed mathematically without regard towards direction but only magnitude while velocity includes information about both movement within these parameters plus its sign(speeding/slowing down). This means whatever value substituted into either position variable yields identical numerical results regardless whether those values belong inside parentheses themselves--if I understand correctly all good..so basically what im saying---both terms cancelout during calculations because nothing else alters them hence making calculation unnecessary yet useful nonetheless.....unless otherwise specified!!

That implies although individually different speeds might lead into accumulation over time however overall rate doesn\u2018t change owing due factor being net sum equals zero when calculated together resulting them ultimately arriving simultaneously regardless timeline taken since all motion eventually levels off if continuously maintained without pause ensuring uniform transition phase until meeting point emerges hence why pythagorean theorem helps compute such cases better compared usual methodologies involving simple subtraction formulas found commonly taught earlier; essentially acting like vectors pointing opposite ways yet equally affective upon reaching destination leaving balance remaining neutralised despite perceived discrepancy created along pathway here presented within context provided above!
