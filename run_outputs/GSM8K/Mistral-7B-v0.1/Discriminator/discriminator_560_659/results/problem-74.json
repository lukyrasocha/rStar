Certainly! To address whether utilizing molecules or atoms resulted in higher expenses solely based on reaction yields requires understanding both concepts deeply within chemical processing contexts. Yield refers to the efficiency of producing desired products relative to theoretical calculations derived under ideal conditions. It doesn't directly account for raw material acquisition or energy input costs but focuses purely on product formation efficiency. Thus, we analyze these elements separately to evaluate overall process economics rather than drawing immediate conclusions strictly from yield percentages regarding individual components usage (molecules versus atoms). Here, considering 'costliness', assume low quantities mean expensive procurement due to scarcity/purity demands while high volumes lead toward bulk discount strategies improving affordability.
