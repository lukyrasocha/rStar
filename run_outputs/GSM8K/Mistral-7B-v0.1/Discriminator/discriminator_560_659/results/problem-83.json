First, let us consider Political & Weather News publication sites which produce around (average) 20 news reports/articles each day; since this happens throughout the entirety of February i.e., over all its twenty eight or thirty one days as appropriate, their output amounts respectively to approximately [Calculation] . Similarly calculating Business News publishing platforms, it was found out upon further investigation that these typically rollout roughly ten stories/report(s)/entries online during course of same period , therefore producing about [Calculation].

Similarly, its sister office made one less publication; it submitted only 10 business stories during this time period. This amounts to another 10 * 28 = <<10*28=280>>280 submissions throughout March.

This means its publishing twice what was stated before therefore adding them up you get your initial value back because their publications combine exactly onto themselves \u2013 thus making no difference when put side by side regardless whether counted individually or combined altogether even though numerically speaking counting alone shows less output overall due percentage increase compared totals but actually represents nothing considering full quantities remain intact through additions without influence affecting either group\u2019s production rates .
