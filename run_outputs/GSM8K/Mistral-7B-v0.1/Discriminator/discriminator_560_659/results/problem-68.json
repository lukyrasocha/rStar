Therefore, It takes approximately 3 years for Adam to reach almost the minimum height necessary for this roller coaster ride.

        " 4 feet tall which is equal to 48 inches (since one foot equals twelve inches). Currently, Adam is only 40 inches tall. That means Adam still requires growth equivalent to 48 - 40 = 8 inches. Given that he can grow by 2 inches per year, it would take him approximately 8 / 2 = 4 years to reach required size as exactly half way through the fourth year, he reaches just about precisely eight inches. However since people don't usually measure their exact age down to months or even weeks within any particular month due to biological variability we round up our results resulting into whole numbers considering also safety measures hence finally you get 'the approximate amount of time needed rounded off'. Therefore, it takes around four complete calendar years before reaching the desired requirement if not earlier. Thus while technically speaking it could possibly happen sometime during these specific forty-eight quarters plus fractional parts less than quarter based on annual growth rate , conventionally when referring particularly to children who might want fun rides like this often adult supervision standards apply especially those aged under consenting majority limits .
