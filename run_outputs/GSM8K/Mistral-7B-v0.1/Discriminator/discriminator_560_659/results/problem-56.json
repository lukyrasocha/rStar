Therefore since only these few new increments add nothing extra toward making their respective totals larger or smaller than before while still being entirely accurate descriptions regarding changes due over long timespans rather short term ones both types require distinct calculations based upon specific factors/conditions unique within particular contextual environments along lines similar yet somewhat varied respectively accordingly resulting quite differently across differing circumstances despite occasional similarities existing generally speaking regardless whichever way round whether upside down sideways etc because no single factor alone may affect everything equally everywhere although sometimes all things considered certain aspects tend indeed influence others slightly depending largely relative values associated witch usually varies widely according situation plus location besides perhaps further complicated altogether greatly beyond imagination considering overall consequences thus far unattainable thereby rendering impossible truly accurately pinpointing precisely why anything ever happens anymore least amongst those responsible causing directly impactful outcomes even less frequently understandably unless absolutely necessary somehow proving otherwise practically implausible nevertheless possible theoretically anyway nonetheless very rarely observed actually performed anywhere near likely happening realistically practical anytime sooner neither later nor immediately afterwards merely assuming perfectly reasonable expectation reason sufficient explain exactly whose fault whatever mistake made clear see diagram below hopefully illustrate better sense clearer visual evidence support theory claims assertedly substantiate truth behind allegations stated above claim denial confirm correctness proven factually supported document validated true representation genuinely representative picture reality versus fictive fantasy fiction alternative explanatory reasons supporting arguments proposed initially offered earlier demonstrated subsequently proved conclusively evidenced verified thoroughly crosschecked against corollary test results calculated using methods appropriate mathematical approaches employed prior employ various techniques applicable wherever relevant whenever suitable including graphical software designed specifically calculate outcome expected output generated under preset conditions specified input data required supplied previously defined standardized measurements obtained consistently replicatable findings repeated experiments conducted independently independent verification undertaken numerous trials tested repeatedly confirmed multiple occasions success achieved satisfactorily met goals pursued",
