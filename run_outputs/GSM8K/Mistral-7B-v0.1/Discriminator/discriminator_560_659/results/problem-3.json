Each package costing $3 brings us to spending sixteen dollars since 'three times '$3 equals '$9'. However due to purchase roundoff requirements meaning you cannot use fractions so any remainders require extra purchases hence necessitating additional expenditure beyond just dividing evenly into full multiples of five within said quantity .

Each party might reasonably want around twice per individual set when celebrants combine activities such festivities often involve broader groups than singular instances; thus multiplying initial estimate doubles it again accounting dual occurrence expectations prevalent during commemorative events tied directly parallel sequential personal milestones marked together especially within domestic gatherings involving extended family units under similar societal norms commonly recognized & observed cross culturally albeit variances may exist due primarily divergence surrounding ceremonial emphasis differ relative ethno demographic background factors influenced chiefly through historic precedents established over generational transitions spanning considerable temporal durations enabling broad scope adjustment analyses undertaken accordingly contextually informed interpretive assessments rendered practicable henceforth ensuring rigorous analytical methodologies employed throughout pertinent stages integral components forming core underlying structural frameworks guiding entire investigation proceedings inclusively culminating ultimately yield conclusions reaching substantial consensus regarding implications bearing direct relevance specific research objective(s), including examining particular impact magnitude associated certain aspect subject matter area considered germane immediate interest holder intent manifesting respective prioritized concerns outlined deliberate agendas shaping decision parameters governing definitive evaluative course forward pursuant strategies deployed aimed maximizing potential utilization value derived resultantly engender benefits accruing tangibly positively influencing substantive aspects warrant further elaborated discussion below subsequently providing foundational insight serving inform general discourse applicable multifarious domains contemplated thereby benefiting collectivity benefit whole society holistically embracement principles universality promoting humanistic values encapsulating inherently intrinsic dignity bestowed rightfully possessed equally everyone irrespective distinction creed belief faith doctrine held spiritual affiliation maintain mutual respect honoring interrelatedness preserving global peace harmony perpetuation everlasting legacy fostering solidarity brotherhood worldwide uniting diverse peoples united aspiration visionary hope optimism courage bravery resilience",
        " is 8 years young ,so he need another 8 candles which makes it 12+8=20 Candles needed . Since its sold in packages we determine first calculate how many package would satisfy him ,which comes out as; Total No.of Packages Required/package(round up) -> ceil Function or Math.ceil Method function if programming language used here..-> Ceiling Value Here : Mathematically calculated above using simple division (in case you want to know);  20 / 5 // => It returns value rounded downwards towards negative infinity.(So not really rounding off but truncation). But when working inside math formulas just ignore this ; This means We require exactly three packets ..*Price Per Package Calculated By PricePerPacket := price_per unit product * Unit Quantity required i.e cost per packet:= Cost Of Buying these amount Units of Product$:: PkgCostEarningByThreePkgsTotal EarningsCalculate As sum(*=> Finally calculating net earnings*) :: Net EarningFromAllProductsAggregateNetEarningAfterTaxesAndExpenses:(total earnings From All Sources)- Tax To Be Paid-(any extra expenses maybe like rent&other bills)->Income Before Expense & tax subtract TAX Amount And Extra Bills Spendable Fund :- RemainderOfThisAmount Will ",
        " makes it 12 - 4 = <<12-4=8>>8 candles. Altogether children need 12+8 = 20 candles. To know cost we divide package amount (candle) divided up by needed candles equals price times quantity per child, or ($3 / 5) \u00d7 20. This comes out equaling $.6\u00d720=$<<.$6*.2=.12>>=12 spent overall. The answer is: 12.",
        " Candles cost about three per fifty (one fifth). Each hundred year group would need ten fourteen forty six fives because it goes up until eleven nineteen twenty thirty sixty eighty twelve etc.. And you\u2019d pay double since we needed another thousand fourth grader plus teacher fundraiser donation! Two sets full set amounts equals enough stuff if both boys share these special occasions together \u2013 just like everyone else when playing sports games but never sharing supplies unless told otherwise\u2026 We all understand here; let me explain further why I chose this method instead trying something completely unrelated such as buying boxes full only available online though cheaply priced ones sometimes areno problem either way considering size restrictions around town anyway besides maybe getting creative ideas using smaller sized containers possibly including things not seen before ever coming across anywhere near anything close even making use what others may deem unnecessary or worthless altogether especially seeing everything get thrown away immediately afterwards leaving no trace behind who really cares right mindfulness matters whatever age means looking ahead toward future goals despite current situation seeming hopeless most likely failing due mainly lack general concern shown towards saving lives anymore regardless good intentions often mistaken common sense knowledge being applied elsewhere apart basic math logic knowing nothing beyond yourself therefore nobody knows except himself personally hence self reliance becomes key necessity learned early childhood education helps develop better habits later developing stronger character traits required living healthier happier life overall promoting peace love understanding kind heart generous spirits while maintaining dignity respect humility fair dealing honesty integrity always remaining true forevermore thankfully having made decision yesterday helped ensure success going forward without question assuming wrong assumptions causing confusion doubts leading fear uncertainty eventually anxiety disappointment sad feelings resulting unhappiness dissatisfaction frustration regret blame anger jealous envy spite bitterness resentment hostile negativity intimidation bullying threats harassment stalking invasion privacy intrusive behavior coercive tactics manipulative pressure psychological stress physical exhaustion fatigue sleep deprivation chronic pain illness injury accidental death suicide homeless begging desperate acts crime violence murder brutality hate extremism fundamentalist radicalization misogynistic oppression discrimination racism sexism feminine ideology transphobia bigotry ableism disability abuse ethnocentrism supremacy patriarchy hegemonical power dominance imperial rule exploitation class struggle working conditions labor rights protest trade war economic sanctions inequality poverty wealth dispar",
        " 4 = 8 years old. Together they make up 12 + 8 = 20 candle ages (since one candle represents one year). They need enough candles so their combined age covers all possible numbers without gaps or overlaps\u2014this forms a sequence called arithmetic progression starting from 1 through n. Since we know both lower bound (1) and upper bound(n), but don\u2019t necessarily have values for every integer within it including 'candles,' let us consider this as finding Fermat triangular number which can calculate using formula n*(n+1)/2 . We solve equation 20*21/2=210 ,which confirms our conclusion above about boys being aged till twenty based off available information provided. Therefore if buying single pack costing  5 candles($3 )for whole range instead individual ones would save him time when purchasing less than needed quantities thus reducing overall expense via bulk discount pricing strategies typical among stores promoting higher profit margins per unit volume sales increases while minimizing stock holding issues associated directly relating back towards optimality theories applied across various retail marketplaces worldwide dealing commodities ranging beyond merely basic food products amongst others such soccer player transfer rights payments usually involving millions upon billions annually depending largely heavily dictated contract lengths often stretching multiple fiscal quarters hence creating potential risks concerning volatile exchange rates especially against currencies denominating said transactions thereby affecting company revenues subsequently leading stakeholders considering equity positions impact negatively affected due lackadaisical approaches shown toward investment securities held locally rather foreign alternatives viewed preferably yield greater returns long term prospectively sustaining economic growth stimulus globally albeit shortcoming immediate gratification satisfaction consumable product orientations designed specifically target individuals seeking personal enjoyability benefits irrespective monetary value assigned respective item purchase motivators always changing dynamically according preference trend shifts observed periodically throughout modern historical epoch since industrial revolution dawn effectively transform social norm behaviour patterns tradition adoption practices prevalent contemporaneously exist prevailingly present reality circumstances contemporary society observing human nature essentially driving innovation technological advances facilitating novel concept exploration further pushing boundaries defining limits expand existing paradigms redefining previously understood definitions conventional methodologies utilized exclusively past centuries becoming outdated obsolete archaic terminology replaced progressive language incorporated lexicon embraced widely",
        " for each year means buying one for ages 1 through 12 which equals 12 candles but since their age difference was counted twice it leaves us needing only three extra candles (for the youngest). This amounts to purchasing 12 original plus 3 extras bringing it up totals as 15 candles needed overall. Candles come sold per set of five so we\u2019ll require sets amounting 15 divided by 5 which yields precisely 3 full size packets costing together according to what information provided price tagged at $3/packet multiplied over quantity demanded brings our expense to 3*3 =$9 herein presented answers under assumption no partial packet purchase intended. Thus ensuring all considerations taken into account without any shortfall or surplus thereby achieving precise calculation adherence following laid out stipulations regarding quantities involved thus making said conclusion both fitting & accurate respective scenario portrayal .

        " Since one pack contains 5 candles, he would need (12 / 5) rounded up equals 3 packs since you can\u2019t purchase part of a package. That equates to three times $3 which totals $9 just for him oldest child. Similarly, the youngest would also require another whole set or three bundles as well therefore adding yet again onto your cost so far making it altogether $(9+9)=$18 spent . However considering we needed additional ones beyond what was covered within these single purchases let us calculate remaining amount required : Total(candles_needed=totalAgeOfBoth*costPerCANDLE)=((ageFirstChild+ageSecondChild)*priceEachSet). Hence,(TotalCostAfterBuyingMultiplePacketsForOnePerson=(TotalNoExtraCandles-(packOfFiveToMakeUpQuantity*(numberOnsets))*$setPrice)). Herein ((extraNeeded+(oneLessPackFromPriorCalcd)))=$1+$4=$5 hence; extraAmountSpent($)=extraNumberReqd/packSize-$noExtrasAlreadyDone.$final",
        " would need 8 candles. Together, this makes 12 + 8 = 20 candles which equal one complete set because every box contains exactly 5 candles (so all boxes used). Each package costing three dollars means that altogether it was just enough candles since we didn\u2019t go beyond whole numbers when dividing up sets needed per age group. Three times ten cents gets us thirty percent off any possible discount \u2013 hence being as cheaply as humanely possible without making yourself feel uncomfortable if you don\u2019t like buying huge quantities together! But remember; humans rarely eat less than their entire meal unless forced upon themselves or under medical advice(a common sight amongst college students), consequently most people order large amounts anyway due primarily economic reasons despite having no personal interest nor inclination towards consuming mass food items either way whatshisname . It really shouldn\u00b4`T b ut very logical though !!! Still although ordering smaller orders may save time spent walking around looking through shelves containing different colored bottles filled with varying levels sugar content\u2026it also tends too increase likelihood errors thus leading ultimately greater expenditure compared ones larger purchase size/volume combination.. Anyways good night everybody sleep tight safe lives .. Cheers cheers dear friends!!! :) "
