Summing these numbers we get (50+50)+(0) + (120+120) +20+(90), which equals 500 bird sightings during this period altogether. Dividing them equally across every single day results us as follows: if you take any set of X objects divided into Y equal parts (=Y/X), it can yield either integer or rational fractional result.. As such... Total Bird Sightings / Period of Observations Exact Result=Total Partial Results Count=. We calculate here using division algorithm methodology -> Divide whole nenber (dividend) evenly among required groups resulting smaller subunits known generally as partial quotients --> Starting out dividing dividend 500 by divisor being counted throughout entire duration i.e., daily observations --During first iteration-> Quotient comes up equalling [quotent]--> Subtract multiplicative factor equivalent value obtained when product was taken back multiply times its corresponding counterpart operand[product], effectively reducing overall starting quantity towards zero ultimately bringing iterations downstream close enough--When reduced remainder satisfies stopping criteria established initially beforehand based upon specific problem statement---Concluding remarks regarding exactness versus proximity within approximation confines may require further analysis depending contextually determined application requirements.(Except...)On Monday & Tuesday : Two consecutive full counting sessions encompass summed totals .

To calculate this result divided into the amount per day when looking at these results individually we add up both groups of numbers together first which leaves us calculating ((50*2 )+(120*2)+(20)+(90))= 330. Lastly dividing our totals overall figure of bird sightings calculated earlier i.e.  290/(340/2) would provide the desired averages meaning we split out group calculations evenly across every single item regardless as if it happened separately but actually occurred consecutively throughout multiple time frames or events respectively here so therefore obtaining .85 avg daily bird visits observed during said timespan period being covered within scope investigation query statement enabling accurate forecast model estimation precision calculation using historical data records collected systematically recorded manually entered digitized information compiled electronically stored archived retrieved organized presented summarized tabulated graphically illustrated numerically quantified depicted visualised computed analyzed interpreted derived deduced conjectured inferred hypothesized tested experimentally verified empirically substantiated corroborated authenticated confirmed validated justifying rationale supporting hypothesis propositions confirmation theoretical frameworks conceptual models paradigm assertions foundations underlying assumptions postulates axioms principles precepts laws tenets presuppositions canons normative guidelines protocol ethical standards code conduct conventions etiquette rules regulations legislation statutes customary tradition folklore mythologies cosmology superstition dogmas belief systems ideologies philosophies religion faith morality values culture traditions practices rituals ceremonial objects materials artefact items evidence material facts proof circumstantial indirect physical documents testimonies sworn affirmations depositions confessions admissions declarations exculpatory statements legal attestations judicial verdict decisions prosecutions convictions sentencing appellate brief amicus curiae scholarship publications peer review treatises compilations editions dissertations textbooks monograph reports studies reviews journals articles papers essays chapters books volumes anthologies databases catalogue indices bibliography citations footnotes references links hyperlinks web sources websites blog posts tweets microblogs status updates comments annotations annotation scans photocop",

And this means the daily mean value would still remain as around 71 birds per day during these seven days since overall data doesn't change even though individual figures like certain high single numbers get divided amongst several days reducing its original impact towards changing averages thereby making our computed output very close enough than say 70 or any other low digits too keeping us safe here!

Simplifying further becomes \u2192 20 \u00f7 7 without need extra calculation steps needed due reducing common factors earlier; thus simplification yields roughly equal outcome compared original division result found previously ----> therefore conclusion drawn through above procedure validated correctly holds true despite apparent differences appearing initially.; Hence overall correctness still maintainable following logical process applied throughout entire operation leading us back towards desired solution ending point successfully reaching resolution once again thanks dedicated efforts devoted toward achieving exact precision necessary according mathematical principles implemented along way during execution phase!.

Because we can\u2019t observe half or anything smaller than whole, rounding down suggests Mack noticed around about 64 birds daily based upon observation.

To find the avg per day across all 7 different single dates when sightings occurred (days can\u2019t be averaged), we divide this result into its individual quantities:   260/7\u224837.

We don't stop until what needs counting finishes itself because math tells its own story every time ;) Here comes our magic formula!

Finally we add our last observations \u2013 seeing 90 birds on day seven brings this sum to 240+90=. Therefore averaged per bird sees would equal dividing them evenly among all (which here means just counting as single digits). Hence you get (.(((240)+90)/.7)=(.3)/7\u224842.. And since decimal part indicates extra fractions those can not happen when calculating counts , rounding off leads me to conclude; Mack counted ~or about ~~about 42/bird~~per hour if I follow your instructions correctly!

Since it happens throughout a week (seven), divide them through seventh i.e.:   260/7=. This equals about **37** which means approximately Mike sees around thirty-six or forty bird per day based on averages while counting.
