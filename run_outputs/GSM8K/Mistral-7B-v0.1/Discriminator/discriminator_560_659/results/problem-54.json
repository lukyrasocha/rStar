However , if using such intervals may lead too extreme figures hence considering twelve complete cycles quarterly seems logical approach taking sixty years maximum duration into account while still staying relatively realistic : i;e ninety six occurrences which yields around fifty six loads ;the above calculation therefore results in approximately hundred eighty gigaliters worth expenses based upon standard market rates applied via prevailing industry normative considerations encompassing various variables influencing overall chargeability parameters including regional location factors impact consumption levels etc ..
