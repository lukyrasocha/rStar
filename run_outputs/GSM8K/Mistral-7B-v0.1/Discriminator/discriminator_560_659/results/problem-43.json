According to the problem statement, we get M= (3/4)*Ruiz_perhour; substituting ruiz\u2019s rates yields M=(3/4)x60 or simply M=45 pounds per hour.. This means marissans output every hour comes out to  45*12 => 540 over twelve hours. Adding both amounts results into Together=> R+Moranges=>   60*12+(a fraction)(b dozen). Simplifying further leads us directly to our solution(total pounds)=    12*[ 60+45] Or put differently::>>Total Pounds Baked===60P+54Dozen== 12*[(sixty)+[five forty]] ======>[simplified========]= [seventy eight][hundredandtwenty ] .Now it matches with option b :",

We get ruiz produces about 60/(3*3)=6(1+a). This means during 12hr or equal time frame marissa would produce m=((4)* ((money rate)-x))=(3+b)(c); here b equals (.3X)+(.3), c stands for .7 X because Marco\u2019s production relative to Roberto\u2019s needs less than half [because if you multiply both sides by four] producing only part ,marco could not match rtobertos productivity..so while roberto gets up early enough tomorrow morning so all work output takes place but before leaving home see ya everyone!goodluck!!!!!the world belongs too those who wakeearly n go fast !we donot care unless someone tells us later when something happens ;p :D ..just wanted yo say goodnight :-)thank u guys very much...have fun learning math~ :)btw im looking forward my first trip next weekend !!
