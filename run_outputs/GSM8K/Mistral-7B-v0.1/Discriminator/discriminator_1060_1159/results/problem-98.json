Simply put food security concerns tend primarily focus around affordability aspects first thing whereas perhaps public health promotion efforts prioritize raising awareness regarding varied alternatives including vegan choices particularly suitable towards elderly demographics while children seem especially prone preferences based mainly upon flavour sensations often lacking complexity otherwise found amongst adult appetites hence why younger generations usually shy away form experimentation due mostly simply personal taste differences yet older individuals embrace open mindfulness allowing greater opportunities seeking out exciting culinary adventures unlike youngsters who instead stick closely together enjoying traditional staples rather risk missing anything important throughout life cycles respectively ..
