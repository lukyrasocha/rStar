This effectively cuts down significantly but still leaves us having plenty remaining distance because considering rest periods/break etc.: Assume maximum effort could sustained ~only about roughly  5 hours(approx)of continuous physical exertion activity before rejuvenation becomes necessary which allows further progress making optimum utilisation feasible hence taking up said figures directly provides better estimation accuracy leading eventually closer overall solution path reaching eventual objective state satisfying constraints fully upon conclusion therefore arrivinge finally successfully solved resultantly yielded hereafter displayed thusforth presented conclusively concluding definitive determination reached above stated desired outcome attainment confirmed unambiguously verifiably corroborated ultimately universally valid accepted without question disputatively deniable or ambiguous unclear indeterminate nebulous uncertain vaguely vague lack clarity obscurity fog uncertainty doubtful doubting hesitancy suspicion skepticism sceptic reluctance reticence antipathy animosity enmity hostility resentment discontent anger irritation annoyance boredom monotony tedium weariness lethargy fatigue tiredness sluggish laziness idleness torpor enervation debilitation infirmity frailty pusillanimity feebleness insignificance triviality petty humdrum pedestrian banality yawn prosaic commonplace routine regular ordinariness bland sameness nothing fancy no excitement thrills joy enthusiasm pleasure delight fulfillment content satisfaction happiness cheery merry gay bright mirth laughter joie de vivre bliss rapturous ecstasy frenzy euphoria bonhomie jovial felicity revelry gaiety buoyant sunshine cheer radiate lighthearted spirited vigour zest dynamism vitality pulse rhythm beat temposoaring heart quickened breath accelerated ventilation rapid resp",
