Since its already calculated when jeffery's sibling turn outwards fifteen, use addition concept here add fifteen together with ten resulting it becoming twenty five so eleven becomes jeffers present age .So using our basic operations math like subtraction or Addition principle if anything let say Joe goes shopping buying forty apples but takes home thirty because three fell off leaving him thirty while sixty minus eighteen equals nineteen , these same fundamental concepts applied solve such problems therefore based upon what alluded above Jeoffreda whose starting point twelve plus another six yields eighteen hencejeffersoncurrentageis eighteen.

We know that if you add these ages together (Martha plus four), You would obtain Jeff's current Age i.e .(x+4) , Where X represents Marthas_age; But first let us calculate Marthas _Age using following relationship : Mike=Mary'+4 ; And knowing Mary+'s father John=.   Let ' J represent Joey,'s Father while letting M denote ' Mary/Daughter.' Thus your problem equation becomes thus simple :- ((('Joey')+ ('Joey''s son')))=((($\\it{John}$))+(($ \\textbf{(M+4)}$)))-(This last variable stands empty because though question indicates its presence it was never explained what role it plays here.) => (My reasoning above might seem overly convoluted but just stick around till I make sense.).

This reveals that Jeff is presently thirty six (a conclusion derived through simple arithmetic calculation ). But wait!

To conclude therefore, it can be said that considering Jim isn't twice or thrice any individual figure here based upon common sense alone but instead adds up partically to represent relative time intervals among three figures involved; you could say essentially \u201cyounger/older\u201d relationships intertwined within this question makeup which creates compound addition effects across these differences themselves thus resulting us directly arriving onto understanding what comes out exactly next according your calculations!

We already established above that this equals approximately 2*Mike's Age - 1; using Mike's age calculated before, our calculation results into (2*24) \u2013 1 or roughly 47 Years Old.
