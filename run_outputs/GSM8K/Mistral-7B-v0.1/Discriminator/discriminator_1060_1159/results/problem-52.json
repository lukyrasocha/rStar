Thus, despite everyone's differing amounts consumed within its limits as long as none exceeded original possession \u2013 every single remaining apple remains equal across these shared pactors regardless whether someone consumes lesser than others proportionately(as suggested). Therefore keeping this contextual alignment intact , once again concluding equitably divided sharing implies unchanging balance irrespective varying consumption preference implying still respective amount held equals precisely those origins set amongst interrelationships bound through alike agreements made forthwith post initiation phase described above when summed up holistically results always exactly mirror back onto primary source quantity established prior establishments .

This makes little or no logic when you try making comparisons using fractions based upon weight i mean if your saying pierre who said earlier that paul could not eat all these apple because he wanted only quarter same thing applies here , but since Jacky cant understand anything I leave him without any apple anyway let us ask : What fraction belongs to them ?
