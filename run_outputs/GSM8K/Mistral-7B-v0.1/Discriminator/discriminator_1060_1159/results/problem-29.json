When it rebounds back ,it goes just half as far down before rebounding again ; so we need another calculation using our fractional values; namely : `(48*.33=16ft)` And thus you would get your desired result.. To simplify further here let us consider multiplying fractions instead directly performing division(since working out percentages):: (`1-(2/3)=~0.33`). Thus if expressed via multiplication:`Total Height<sub>(after nth bounce )</sub>=Initial DropHeight*(Bounce ratio)^n`. Where Bounce Ratio=`[P(p)-Q(q)]%`; Or simply put : Total:= Initial^(RateOfRecoveryAfterEachDrop)*NumberofDrops+ReductionFactorPerCycle*`(b^x)`.

        " height with each bounce. Nathan dropped the ball from the third floor which was approximately 24*3=72 feet up off the ground (as three stories are roughly around 24 feet). This means the first drop reached about (.6)*72=43.2 feet upon landing back onto the trampoline or hardwood surface before taking another jump. It follows through this reasoning again for calculating the resultant position following the next iteration i.e., take .6x(.6)x(72)=15.55ft during the airborne portion post the initial contact prior to reaching earth once more as per Newtonian law; thus making sure the calculations match reality even if physics itself isn\u2019t always so clean cut due to external factors including thermal energy transfer among atoms inside objects etc.. To avoid confusion let us simplify things instead using fractional arithmetic just like what we used initially here hence ignoring those other aspects present while attempting such problems involving gravitational force exertion along linear motions resulting into circular arc trajectory paths typical when observing various motion related scenarios either via kinematics equations directly derived form Fd=(mv^2)/r thereby simplifying problem statements accordingly allowing easier understanding since only magnitude matters rather than directionality associated wiith any individual vector being involved within specific system boundaries under study \u2013 whether moving horizontally downwards towards Earth over specified distances calculated according known variables applicable locally nearing respective locations mentioned earlier based solely purely geometrical considerations disregarding potential influence caused naturally occurring elements found nearby affecting outcome results significantly depending mostly surrounding conditions encountered outside laboratory environments generally speaking although keeping everything simple enough still ensures maximum accuracy level obtainable anywhere worldwide regardless location type observed overall yielding good estimates useful everywhere globally quite often sufficient needed particularly concerning majority cases studying generalized effects across large scale area measurements required routinely practiced regularly applied throughout history long gone past presently considered common sense knowledge universally acknowledged alike wherever planet happens inhabited without necessarily need further explanation beyond simply stating fundamental theory underlying concepts explored thoroughly examined extensively ever developing continuously building better frameworks enabling increased precision every time progress achieved forward faster pace accelerated toward goal sooner yet eventually arrives destination sought complete whole unified picture emerging altogether comprehending entirety together wholly grasp concept finally master completely understand subject topic tackling entirely fully covering all necessary details addressed successfully accomplish objective proposed attainment desired expected outcomes produced satisfactorily satisfying audience demand satisfaction consumers content",

And no matter whether we throw something vertically (upward)or horizontally(leftwards), without strong opposing force acting as thrust this object still falls back down due to gravitation pull .
