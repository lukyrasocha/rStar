Addition rule outted these variables resulting in totals being equal as follows: Minutes taken += Milliseconds All Added Together ====  4 +   6     +         ~            +             1      ===   10          milliseconds It takes every group member around ten thousand clock units /seconds when adding everything together.

This results in M = T_m = 4H/2h, translating into around halftime duration due to direct comparison made without additional details about splitting times like previous rounds but not precise otherwise.(rounding off slightly underestimated if exact division wasn't meant).
