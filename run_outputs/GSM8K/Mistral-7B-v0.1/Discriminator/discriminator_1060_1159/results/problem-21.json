Calculate Halfway through this equation you get 'twice (x equals ninety)' which means multiplying twenty times forty. That results in eighty hundred one fifty point four minus eighteen would yield seventy seven six thousand two hundred twelve five hundred thirty three or numerically speaking Seventy Seven Thousand Two Hundred Fifty Three Point Four . Thus, we can conclude ,Frankie\u2019s Bowling Score Equals Eight Thousand Six Hundred Forty One. ",
        " half of Binkie's score which would serve as multiplier because it says 'twice'. Twice of 90 equals (2*90) or 180. Add up those numbers; adding 15 yields your solution ((180+15)= 195). Therefore Frankie scored 195 points during their joint outing. ",
        " provided details but not simply subtracting them directly since it involves operations other than just subtraction (twice Binkie\u2019s score plus addition). Twice Binkie's score would equal 2 times 90 which equals 180. To calculate fourteen less three dozen oranges amounting to thirty fewer pears compared to eighty apples you need first find out how many pounds half a bushel represents based on one hundred seventy loaves made into forty buns per batch requiring twenty crust inches respectively; however this query seems unrelated unless further context suggests otherwise\u2013so ignore these calculations.)

        " (F) can be expressed using variables based upon known information: F = 2B + 15 As such your first task will consist mainly of replacing variable value(s). With respect to our equation above substituting B=90 We get therefore;   \ud835\udc39 = 2 *  90+15 or alternatively stated simply but identically;    \ud835\udc39=180+15 Once calculated quickly it becomes apparent;   \ud835\udc41 = 195 Therefore if Binkies scored well I imagine so did Franks.
