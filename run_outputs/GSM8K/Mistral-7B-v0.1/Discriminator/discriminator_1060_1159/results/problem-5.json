        " tests. Adding this sum with the fourth test (which earned him 80): 300+80=380. To find the arithmetic mean we divide it by 4 since these all represent different items so you want their total divided into four equal groups. Therefore dividing the summation which equals 380 / 4 results to obtain an approximate value around but not exactly .  It\u2019s also possible to use integer division here because most scoring systems only award whole numbers anyway. This means doing floor calculation rather than rounding; essentially ignoring decimals without making them negative or zero values when reducing fraction sizes during calculations/rounding outcomes based upon those smaller parts like hundredth places etc.). Result shows us \u201cfloor(average_total)/count\u201d formula becomes effective thus providing clearer understanding while still offering useful info about averages too!

We divide this sum, representing the aggregate amount earned over these examinations as compared against their count, or the denominator; hence we get 380/4 since he took out only four exams. By doing so you acquire around  95(a decimal value), but because question asked us 'what', not 'how high'. It expects exact numerical figure without approximation ,henceforth our best choice here would represent averages found through standard calculation methods . Therefore finally rounding off nearest integer yields whole numbers instead fractional sums typically used when dealing calculations involving weights etc.. Thus concluding thusly : An approximate rounded int based solution turns into complete no remainder integers meaning if any further division occurs beyond one part per hundred place digits accuracy won\u2019t affect next higher denomintation units like cents etc even though both exist valid within contextual boundaries set forth rules above) Consequently answering said inquiry precisely translating roughly worded query demands explicit figures yield precise responses required therefore resulting correct definite formated output listed below accordingly !!!

Since there needs to be a multiple solution here\u2026we know if Jhon takes another perfect set like last time(for example taking all correct answers out),then add them separately .

But I guess you need only one formula... Also remember Arithmetic averages doesn\u2019t indicate variability within range \u2013 It indicates middle point . Please note : Range shows variation / diversity ; standard deviation tells about dispersion & error bounds around said average but not so useful when discussing raw performance level etc., You see We don\u2019t use median here because its midpoint would always be less than actual maximum mark possible , thus depict incomplete picture due this limitation too..
