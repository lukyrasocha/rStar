Since we know each sando comes with 4 meatballs, Sidney\u2019s first order totals to 7(sub sandwich) \u00d7 4(meatball per sub)=<<7*4=28>>28 meatballs. Next identify the quantity of meatball Sub Sandwiches fed upon by mark; since we understand Mark consumed 4 out of Sidneys\u2019 original seven subs it means, 4\u00d74 or 16 Meatballs get served up.

        " tells us Mark consumed four of Sidney\u2019s meal; hence, we multiply this quantity times four (the amount contained within one Sandwich). That translates into him consuming 4x4=16 meatballs. Subtract the above value from the initial count obtained earlier when calculating the original order\u2014that implies Sidney still owes himself(before reordering) 7*4-16 = 9 extra meatball units. Lastly, identify new quantities present before subtracting them. When Sidney orders additional sandwiches, you add these values onto your previous calculation--he orders three newly made subs so 3*4+9 or seven extra meatball measures remain . Thus, the solution identifies that seventeen remaining unit counts equate to fifteen full sandwich portions available if shared among individuals since it requires dividing up equally without breaking any items apart as indicated by contextual relevance . Henceforth , Fifteen complete meatball sandwich servings survive post consumption ; which amounts totalling twentyMeatBalls because every single serving harbours preciselyfourFourmeats per piece.. ",

Since no exact amount is provided here though let us choose a specific option within what would make sense logically -- say seven; meaning seventh sub would get consumed directly later making our calculation simpler which still fits into 'three subtracting ones'. Thus initially Sidney went ahead buying 7 meatball subs because if he tried getting close to eight or over thus trying not only fulfill but even exceed expectations towards having them ready immediately upon arrival home however nothing like waiting around makes too much practicality workable so instead pick slightly underneath limit leaving space just enough till arriving without need further delay due excess wait plus considering restock taking part possible also included factor consideration involved process timeline associated activities performed post meal consumption/prep timeframe etc..
