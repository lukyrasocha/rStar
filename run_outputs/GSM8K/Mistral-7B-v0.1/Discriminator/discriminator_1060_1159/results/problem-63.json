        " dog that is twice as heavy (or half) the weight of Kory's dog. Halfway down this passage can help you understand it better! His first dog weights 60 / 4 or 15 lbs while his second dog weights doubled compared to his heavier sibling so that equals  2*15=30lbs. Altogether both combined equal those numbers together which results into a summed amount of their entirety being 15+30 = <<15+30=45>>45lb . Add these amounts up to get your result hence showing all steps used clearly.

Let us calculate all these figures based on their relative sizes; according to Condition 1 as follows: X=Kary_dog/Four; hence X=(1/4)*60=. Given this value of 'X', let us replace its equivalent percentage into our equation to find out actual values i.e., if Naughty dog actually takes up .25*(Kary_dog) part of Kary's bodyweight, therefore  60*.25 = 15lbs.

This means according to Condition 2 that Elijah owns also one animal which doesn't change its overall mass but only changes proportions within this whole group; let Y represent the second pet here whose relative amount compared against other pets needs calculating next time too! We know everything combined adds up together since both sets include their individual masses plus whatever overlaps occur among them--meaning all four amounts come out evenly when multiplied together rather than needlessly repeated individually across these factors(which would increase our working process). Therefore,the correct option D because adding them yields less output while choice B increases value incorrectly asserting heavier contribution without factual basis supporting such assumption\u2013so C cannot apply either way due strictly logical inconsistencies arising throughout calculation sequence thus no valid rationale behind preferring any alternative selection beyond mentioned logic flaws prevent general consensus adoption amongst participants using reasonable evaluation standards applied uniformly towards multiple scenarios involving different variables impactful upon outcome determination procedures employed consistently during problem solving activities engaging distinct parameters influencing variable interactions inherent complexities enveloping respective systems dynamics analyzed sequentially under specific constraints unique identifiers assigning relevance levels distinguishing pertinent information meriting particular attention vs irrelevant distractors aiming solely serving detrimental obfuscation purpose hindering comprehensible resolution pathways thereby causing unnecessary confusion obscuring crucial insights essential understanding clarity fosters optimal decision making efficacy advancing collective welfare objectives pursued relentlessly until satisfactory results achievement ensures beneficial societal contributions made possible through diligent efforts expended striving progress despite challenges confrontations posed allies emerge opportunistic collaborative endeavours promoting shared interests further empowerment individuals contribute integral resources mobilization sustained effort optimum utilization resource potential maximizes productivity ultimately elevated society living conditions enhances holistically appreciable realms vast transformational prospect offered unprecedented possibilities manifest destiny reality embrace future horizons embracingly aspire reaching loftiest heights human spirit ever imagined journey unfold infinite dimensions yet explore still countless mysteries await revelation excavate latent secrets buried deep past civilizations forgotten eras echo timeless tales whisper stories carry legacy forward inspire generations posterity inherit tomorrow brighten uncertain futurity guarantee dawn arriveth prosperous epoch commemorate anniversary advent",
