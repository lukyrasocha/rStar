        " states Lauren needs to complete 49 small-sized scene illustrations. Calculate this time using what method best suits you (using ratios etc) and show your work clearly! To calculate the number of days needed for each task, we divide the total number of pictures required for each size category by the maximum number of those sizes that Lauren can draw daily. We choose these maximums because working as efficiently as possible minimizes the overall completion time. Large Scenes: \\( \\frac{45}{5} \\) which equals 9 days Medium Scenes: \\( \\frac{36}{6} \\) which equals 6 days Small Scenes: \\( \\frac{49}{7} \\) which equals 7 days Therefore, based on our calculations, Lauren would require different amounts of full days to fulfill orders depending upon whether smaller tasks allow us opportunities to reallocate resources better than simply completing only one type during every single scheduled drawing period. Adding up individual requirements shows potential overlapping possibilities so optimal scheduling could lead towards less cumulative efforts under specific constraints such as deadlines imposed against other factors like quality considerations while optimizing worker efficiency .

Finally, we find out that Lauren needn\u2019t work any additional time drawing small-sized scenery since our assumption implies that when working fulltime (i.e., daily) producing high quantity items such as mediuim sized images which require fewer effort compared making low quality ones like larger scaled works also help us increase throughput hence allowing quicker completion rates via simultaneous execution strategy leading towards minimised overall production duration times thanks partially due improved economiesofscale advantages present thus enabling accelerated output acceleration ultimately culminating into shorter finished product realisation timelines whilst maximising efficiency thereby reducing costs associated wth slower delivery speeds typically seen elsewhere within industry sectors using similar techniques namely painting , graphic design & illustration rendering processes etc .

And finally, for creating small-sized painting scenarios, since we know one scenario requires only drawing time (not any other factor), you divide them as well. This means it takes another 49 / 7 =  7days. Summing up everything together results into 9+6+7=22 days required altogether which includes making every size simultaneously because during this period both tasks could happen concurrently henceforth justification why summed hours equals simultaneous working duration rather than sequential calculation addition. Therefore, if drawn independently ,the calculated summation represents potential completion timeline assuming zero interruptions; however considering realistic workflow including necessary breaks rest periods etc., actual achievement usually overshoots forecasted estimates owing due diligence requirement ensuring quality maintenance throughout exhaustive creative endeavor undertaken thus confirming longer expected task fulfillment tenure visibly above initially presumed calculations outlining basic individual contributions combined within respective contextual framework .

        " day. Thus, to complete 36 medium-sized pictures, she requires 36 / 6 = 6 days. Finally, drawing seven small scene every day means taking roughly 49/7 = 7 days would suffice as well. Therefore, summing these up reveals the solution; It takes her about (9+6+7) = 22 working days under those conditions. Hence, the full completion time including weekends amounts around approximately twice this value if we consider standard workdays only, but not applicable here since task demands exceed regular job capacity making any consideration unrelated henceforth relevant daily limit irrelevant while considering individual capacities towards single tasks separately nonetheless collectively overtime calculation might still need actual calendar dates depending upon holidays etc., which isn\u2019t provided thus requiring approximation rather than exact figures.

        " = 6 days. Lastly, Lauren can draw 7 small-sized picture scenes per day. To complete  49 small-sized picture scenes, she requires 49 / 7 = 7 days. Since these tasks can occur simultaneously (in parallel), we look for maximum time required which occurs while drawing any size scene i.e., largest value among them all. Thus, Max(9 ,6, 7) represents longest duration needed which comes out as '9'. Therefore, It would require Lauren '9 Days', when working diligently every single day without breaks. ",
        " day. To create 49 small-sized picture scenes, she needs 49 / 7 = 7 days. Therefore, overall, she would need 9 (for large) + 6 (for medium) + 7 (for small) = 22 days to complete everything. The answer is: 22."
