Each separate activity consumes distinct quantity of resources thus when addressing such type of math problems concerning human activities within specific period using basic units measurement (in this case \u2013 standard \u2018Hour') without specifying particular resource being involved (e.g., electric power consumption), typically only combined effort gets considered whereas detailed itemized computation isn\u2019t required unless otherwise specified intentionally..
