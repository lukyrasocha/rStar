But first let us find out how big their individual shares truly are based solely off numerical values here instead; regardless whether others feel differently about personal preferences when considering different types/flavors etc).

Since Becky took one slice less away, let us calculate what it means if someone else takes one away before being subtracted together this group member needs to get another serving according to him. This happens since silvia only gets half extra compared too jake which would mean adding those additional servings up first making their amount doubled instead due its factorization resulting during multiplication like multiplying integers times exponents within radical expressions while incorporating fractional parts amongst them all . Therefore using division makes perfect sense considering having three people divide equally sharing among themselves hence accounting into every aspect regarding percentages along time intervals ratios etc..

From those four pizzas you can extract another 4x8=32 slices, therefore everyone together consumed both batches equaling(previous result)+(extra slice)=32 slices. The answer is: 32.
