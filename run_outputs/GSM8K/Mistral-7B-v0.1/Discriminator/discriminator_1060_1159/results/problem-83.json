It can be calculated as follows :   Number of Lemons/Year=  Trees \u00d7 Citrus Fruits Per Year\u00d7 Tree        Total Years    \u2794 Total Occupation    `Total occupation` refers to productivity throughout time or periodicity over which production takes place; it includes all outputs generated during such interval(time duration) while ignoring inputs used up within this same span.<|end_of_document|> This implies you calculate everything taking into account only output produced. Herein we would multiply annual lemon yield by years taken , hence:`Number Of Trees*Citrus fruits Produced By One Plant During Annual Timeframe*(Annual Period)* Decade`. Plugging our values yields ;=> `(5*6LemonsPerTreeForthePeriodOfOneCalendarYEAR)x(Decade)=(5*6LemonPearsByEachPlantDuringACalenderYEAR)x(Decimal Equivalent To 'A DECADE')which equals => 30LemonPearsProducedByEveryGrowingInstanceInAPeriodICreasedWithADecade .Substituting variables leads to ((5+trees)^citableTimeUnit^Deccada);This means when multiplying growth periods(yrs), one must consider not adding but exponential increase i.e.:((gives us:(exp)Trees^(Decades))==>>=(numplants**decimal equivalentTo\"aDecaRe));->"
