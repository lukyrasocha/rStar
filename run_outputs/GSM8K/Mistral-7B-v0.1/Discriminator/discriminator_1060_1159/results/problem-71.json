Given all four logs accounting together need equal amount of space (as implied), this means one such group provides just enough branches for cutting without any waste. Hence considering every batch includes these equivalent amounts; thus if ten sets yield upwardly approximate sums around about $24*, but since exact numbers may vary slightly because rounding off might occur during process stages like measuring/cutting etc.; thereby confirmation comes directly towards estimations rather than absolute values*.

That means our actual productive wood length amounts to just one quarter or 1/4 instead of what you previously considered all eighty feet but still this amount represents four separate logs! Here\u2019re your steps broken up even further : \u2022 Cutting off trunk branches while cutting them apart \u2014 about another third gone here\u2026 This leaves roughly sixty percent unused versus whole original piece!!

That means that only 80/100= .8 or simply multiply original size times this %. Resulting length would be  80(.8)= 64 ft., not taking away anything yet! Those same ones further divided yields exactly three individual blocks since their dimension matches perfectly without remainder when dividing four together vs having remnant piece afterwards subtract its own measure equal amount once again\u2026and thus you\u2019ll get one last block leaving us with our sought value i.e.:five sixteen plus seven fortyseven twentyone etcetera making up thirtyfour items altogether hence generating earnings worth per item set price\u00d7quantity combination\u2014result equalling precisely hundred fiftysix dollars ($).
