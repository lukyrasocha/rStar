To find difference in expense one can simply subtract thrice forty minus sixty four ($30-$32). Subtracting yields negative sixteen($-6$).

However, while I would expect this bounding methodology might yield results even lower than what you saw experimentally\u2026it doesn\u2019t appear practical; aside being computation intensive \u2026\u00a0and probably needlessly so since your original question was merely asking about finding those ranges containing no composite numbers above one million ***AND*** ensuring continuity throughout entirety of their expanse via nonnegative derivatives . Still , despite these restrictions regarding complexity / computability ; still useful numerical insights into optimal intervals thus present themselves :",
        " mentioned as being \"$3\". Calculate the savings made through purchasing multiple bananas together versus separately using individual prices ($8) minus batch purchase ($3). Savings equal $(8 - (($0.80*4)*10)). To find this result compute 8-$3.2=$-$4.8 Therefore the amount saved equals $$4.8 . Thus 'the amount saved was forty eight cents'. The answer is: 0.48.",
        " individual bananas are available through purchasing ten (10) banana bunches \u2013 this was specified as having four bananas per bundle. That means one hundred bananas would come out if you calculated it based upon multiplying their quantities together [(10 groups) X (four items / group)] which amounts totaled up towards exactly one hundred [(10)(4)=40]. To calculate savings determine first what amount needed to purchase these ones separately -- multiply quantity times unit value; hence twenty thousand cents ([$ . . 8]X[ ]). From here just extract whole numbers representing dollar signs i.e., divide those figures into twenties since we\u2019re dealing only with monetary values ($[$ . .)$][/$.]).
