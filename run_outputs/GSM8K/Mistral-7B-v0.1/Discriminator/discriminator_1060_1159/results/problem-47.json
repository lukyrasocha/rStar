To find out what percent this represents (in other words, figure out who makes up those remaining 60%) it is simple subtraction; you just take 100 minus 40 equals 60%. Since we know that 60% corresponds into 240 kids or parts, let us divide the whole thing accordingly to determine its worth as units per one hundredth part(i.e., division). That would entail performing these calculations separately within our equation above\u2026 We start off dividing both terms \u2013 so begin multiplying numerator times denominator before simplifying further down through factoring processes thus reducing calculation complexity significantly during intermediate stages while keeping accuracy intact till reaching your eventual solution eventually..

Doing so yields T = 240 / 0.4 Thus, we find out about T; however, our objective was finding just G i.e., Number Girls Students only.
