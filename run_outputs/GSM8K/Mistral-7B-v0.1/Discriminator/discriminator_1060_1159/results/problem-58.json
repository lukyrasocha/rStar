To make matters even worst... what if Mr.'Tate mixed different breeds inside just one single category like 'Females', right?

What is the current total population of animals in the lake if fifteen additional baby frogs were born while twelve turtles decided to leave the lake due to construction work nearby?

Calculate only considering water creatures initially mentioned, without accounting any outside factors like human activities which might affect them such as hunting habits etc., but incorporate predator-prey relations assuming every frog consumes ten insects daily except when hibernation occurs once per year reducing consumption rates down to fifty percent over four weeks starting October until February inclusively before resuming its standard diet schedule post this period..

        " male goldfishes, and 5 female goldfishes before getting additional ones. This sums up to (4+7)+(3+5) = 19 fishes initially. When comparing this against the updated count we get ((4+(7-(1)))+((3+(5-(3)))))= 20 fishes including both types. To find out if these numbers correspond properly consider what was increased i.e., only females so it doesn't affect males. Females increase to (7+(1)), while others remain as counted above; hence resulting equation becomes (1x)(8+6)=14 new totals. Thus adding to initial values yields us resultant figures being higher because quantity wasn't evenly distributed amongst either group. Which implies difference exists! Let further decompose said figure such that comparison would make sense\u2013and thus discern exact disparity.. We see following representation: Male Fish vs NonMale Fish Total Initial :   M G F    Before Buying    4     7      5          Totals           16         But Considering New Entries ; Updated Figures Post Purchase Would Read Something Similar .

Therefore Resultants From Such Actual Conditions Are Definitely Present Here At Work Also !! Indeed They Require Application And Analysis Of Allocated Provisions ..So Final Summary Statement Should Sound Like \u2013\u201cSince Both Calculation Results Reflect Even Balance & Neat Distribution Across Each Set Based Upon Established Baseline Values Prior Enduring Transactions That Occurred During Recent Interaction With Our Target Zone Within Given Limits Constraining Those Existing Composition Types Being Compared Through Previously Identified Parameter Metrics While Keeping Equivalent Measures Consistent Whether Direct Or Relative By Nature Despite Possibly Fluctuating Magnitudes Associated Either Side Absolute Scores Due Main Motion Dependence Placing Substitute Value Units Among Two Groups Comparatively\u201d Finally Hence ",

        " (guppies) + 3(goldfish)+ 5 (goldfish)= 20 creatures. Later according to conditions 2 & 3, we buy new organisms which means adding 2 males guppies, one females guppy, along with 2 males and three additional females golds \u2013 so this addition totals up into 2+1+(2)(male)-(3)(female), equaling zero difference as far as gender consideration goes because both additions maintain equilibrium considering the current population distribution among different species within their own categories; thus no increase/decrease observed! Henceforth since neither sex group increases nor decreases per se during these purchases i.e., it remains constant across all four types being considered thereby making such quantification redundant whereas our interest still lies solely directed towards identifying any discernible pattern related specifically toward Females vs Males regardless whatever other variables may come offhandedly involved including ones not even contemplated here right away just yet like perhaps dietary preferences or habitat selection strategies etc.. Therefore concluding essentially nothing further about potential disparities concerning those specific traits without having access comprehensive data relating back first place starting point itself doesn\u2019t really apply hence moving forward let us directly address question posited earlier regarding comparative magnitude differences vis-a-vis individual populations falling under distinct categorizations respective themselves namely Male Guppies versus Their Female counterparts alike also equally applicable when scrutinizing distinctions amongst Two Separate Cohort Components Collectively Classified Under \u2018Goldfish Breeds / Subspecies Specific Identifiers Based Along Generic Gender Definitions Rather Than Species Appropriately Naming Sites Of Habitat Preference Such As Stream Banks Or River Side Pools And Lakesides Where Fish Typically Reside When Considerations Related To Water Temperature Regimes Dictate Suitable Condition Variables Requirement Facilitated By Presence Near Natural Geographical Barriers That Help Buffer Local Ecosystem Dynamics During Periodical Seasonal Transitions Ensuring Maximum Safety With Minimal Risks Associated Within Biotic Communities Possibly Resultant From Anthropogenic Interactions Due Particular Human Impact Factor Factors Correlated Against Current Trends Regarding Global Warming Climate Change Pattern Disruptions Adversely Effect Overall Aquatic Environment Health Prompt Urgent Mit",
        " fish. By Condition 2 (when it says 'Tate...'), we add up what was purchased which makes them buy 2 more male guppies making 4+2=6 males; adds another female guppy raising females numbers to 7+1 = 8 ;also 2 additional male goldfish so total males go as follows :  3+2 = 5 golden ones , while acquiring extra three female goldfish increases their amounts thus becoming 5+3 = 8 . Therefore reducing difference equation becomes 8(Female) minus sum totals of Male Fish [which equals,] i.e., Males subtract Females resulting this way =>M = F/6 or M=(2*F)/6 if one want percentage but let\u2019s stick here not going into percentages yet......and remember I said you wanted Difference Equation??
