As such if you would want him only to answer what didn\u2019t mention above, subtracting from our base quantity leaves so:    80 minus 16 equals...          64 responses needed daily; Since here asked about a workweek length expressed using \u201ca ______\u201d, or rather because no specific time unit was provided I shall assume a normalized regular working hours system namely \u2018Standard American Work Week System'.

Since he doesn't reply to these first 20%, or half of his emails every single day, it means only other 50%.
