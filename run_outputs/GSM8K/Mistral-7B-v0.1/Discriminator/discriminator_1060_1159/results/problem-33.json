        " East wall: 5 x 8= 40 square feet; West wall: 5 x 8 = 40 square feet. Total Area = (North Wall + South Wall) + (East Wall + West Wall). That means  80+80+40+40 = 240 sq ft. One Gallon covers 20 Sq Ft so you need   240/20 = 12 Gals. Each gallon costs $12 ,so your price would become    12*$12=$144 To purchase all twelve buckets(Gallons), It would Cost You        $144 ",

Next find out how many gallons Tony needs which would take dividing their combined areas by coverage per gallon so...(240 / 20). Divide=12 gal needed but since you cant buy parts of a gallon round up! Buy whole amounts thus..ceil function says we need  13 gallons. Lastly multiply this into price per gallon\u2026we get our last result ($12*13)=$156. ",
        " add them all together to get: Total Area = (North Wall) + (South Wall) + (East Wall) + (West Wall), which equals [80+80+(40+40)]=240 sq ft. Divide this number into what one container covers or paints per coat as if no wastage exists [(Area)/(Covers Per Gallon)=Total Number Of Containers]= [total area]/[covers/gallon]=[square feet covered before buying next tin /coveragesperpaintcan]. This turns out like [Gallons Purchased ]=(area/coverage per pintx)$costofeachptin) , hence our formula becomes:[sqft purchased/(Cover Size)(Pint Cost)],hence:(240/20)*$12=$<<240/20*12=144>>144.[$(number)^n*(number))]] Where N represents Gross Areas Covered By One Tiny ($Cost)-[$((Number_toWash^numOfCanNeeded)))-(VolumeAquiredForSingleApplication($PerPaintTin$))] As you see here I first used basic division $(areassqrtudivicision=\\text{no waste})$which allowed me later multiplication $\\times$, since multiple costs needed multiplying over itself due their relationship,(multiplicationsimultiplicationandrevenue). Lastly put those results inside parenteses followed up with exponents$\\left(parenthesethenexponent\\right)$. That\u2019s right! Just remember always consider variables such as Waste factor when doing real world scenarios because these math problems aren\u2018t usually so simple.. But nevertheless good luck using above algorithm!. To find out how many containers Tony needs to buy: Square foot coverage calculation would involve dividing the total surface area by how much space one quarty container could handle without any leftover spots untouched.\r",

Therefore, It would cost Tony $144 to complete his project if everything went according to plan. This assumes no overage or waste due to surface irregularities which may require extra coats, as well any miscalculations during installation process such as painter error estimations (painter\u2019s marks/measurements etc).
