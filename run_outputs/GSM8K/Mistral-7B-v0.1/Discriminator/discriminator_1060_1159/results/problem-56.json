That equals  10 additional students. We need to subtract those extra people who joined since their presence changes next years count too hence yielding new student attendance count as follows : New Students attended = old Count + Additional Attendants(From Last Year Percent Change)= 50+(10)` Therefore It can also Be Written As:`New Student attendant=(Old One+Old one*(PercentChangeToEnroll))`,Hence Substituting our known values ,we get;NewStudentAttandant=```python",

That comes out as 10 additional students (because 50*0.2=10), which means adding them onto our original count leaves us with 60 students (50+10) for current semester or year based upon context provided within question. Hence, this year there're  60 students studying Calligraphy Classes , so if further increases happen next years also add those calculations accordingly too!

        " if their school sent away a student every third month (or 4 times), it would take four months for all these new pupils to leave the institution..
