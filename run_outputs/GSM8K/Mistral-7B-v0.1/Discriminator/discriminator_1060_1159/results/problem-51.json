        " * 5 = 55 dollars after selling all the blue balls. And finally, it gets another 25 * 3 = 75 dollars when all the green ones are gone. Adding these together we get 27+55+75=157 which means the store would receive one thousand fifteen seven dollars (given as integer) if I round down because otherwise you can not pay less than a dollar. The answer is: 1157 or rounded off into whole numbers this comes up to 1157$ . We also need to consider case B; However using decimals makes no sense since someone cannot contribute only partial amounts therefore option A holds right here even though theoretically Option C could come true but practically speaking you cant divide bills so its always better sticking your options either way around rather than getting confused further unnecessarily unless asked specifically use decimal values too hence answering correctly according my intuition lets go ahead solve them both!
