Therefore, we first determine speed of the second fastest car (since it travels further), this would mean multiplying `120 miles/hour` \u00d7\u00a0`5`, resulting into `600 mph`. Thus , based off our information provided; `(speed of Fast Car) /(Speed of Second Fastest)=1.25` . Hence solving above equation results into `. (`FastCar= SpeedofSecondfastest*1.25`). Substituting values stated earlier(`Speed Of Third+rd Fastest`) Results : FastCar\u2009=\u200a`600miles*/second fastestcar*`\u00d7`1.25`.`So calculating value reveals us,the ``fastest`` car went around `:2500 mph.` This calculation shows just how insane top speeds really get when comparing even slower vehicles like ordinary family sedans!",

Since you want to find the top most performing racecar which goes just little bit further ,it becomes clear quickly that : It needs only simple arithmetics . Indeed if the last mentioned vehicle performs better still but not even twice as good like its next competitor ;the other simply multiplies its performance factor i.e., this time instead of being 'twice'-as quick or ten-,fivefold as rapid ...so here follows quite obviously right away our formula:f(x)=k+v--> f(x) represents the speed of the superfast car..in terms of relative performances v stands for velocity...and k denotes constant additive part--just another term!
