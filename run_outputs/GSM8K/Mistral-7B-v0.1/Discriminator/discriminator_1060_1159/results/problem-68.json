Therefore if you add these 2 past decades ('backwards') into consideration together \u2013 i.e.,  16+2=18 , one gets what might correspond as approximately half the value related to another individual aged person during those same eras too; because while growing up older children generally develop faster than adult ones due both developmental stages coinciding etc... Hence why doubling(?) makes sense here! When thinking about someone who ages exactly like their twin brother or cousin but slightly younger overall -- although still having common experiences regardless so everyone sees them through similar eyes eventually-- consider also any shared memories/experiences going hand & foot forward every new decade plus whatever special events happen along life journey thus making things seemingly familiar yet unique all around world wide web land..

Since all humans can not really exist into fractions hence consider this value rounded off upto nearest whole numbers thus making him approximately fifteen plus minusone; since fractional human existence isn't feasible therefore rounding upward suggests adding another unit bringing us closer to being twenty but still remaining under thirty ; meanwhile considering downwards brings me closest approximation towards our desired solution viz 'sixteen', implying thereby deducable consideration aligning toward concluding statement regarding youngest child birth typically commencing around twelve according research studies globallly although differents across diverse nations cultures etc!

Since Liang used to be twelve which implies Vince needed to start as sixteen divided into four parts equals him being three point seven fifth ages\u2026..we can assume this man needs seventeen months....but since none of these options apply...the question assumes someone made up their own math riddles.....it appears our answers cannot help us properly calculate anyone 's current true amount if asked correctly!! It could very well mean just imagine numbers without regard but make sure you know what those represent anyway! I find myself wondering why nobody thought using simple division might work better instead perhaps adding something extra onto both sides equaling out nicely too :) But either way its all fun playing around right lets go ahead try solving like normal people :D Ok let's see , suppose lia wants vincetos present value times sixtoagainthetuvenwhichgivesfiftyseventhagesum .
