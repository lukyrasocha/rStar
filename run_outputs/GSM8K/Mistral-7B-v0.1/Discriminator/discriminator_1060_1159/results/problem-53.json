        " (or decreases) by 8 degrees Celsius. This brings it to 2 \u00b0C \u2013 8\u00b0 C= |\u20136|. Next apply second changes, meaning add or increase again but this time by 3 degrees Celsius. Adding means adding so |\u20136|+ 3\u00b0\u2009C\u200a=\u2009\u2010\u20093\u00b0\u00a0C . Thus ,the value comes out as negative three degree Celsius. As such we can also say that when you subtract a larger integer than your starting positive number; let\u2019s use four instead of eight here because \u201cdropped\u201d implies subtraction \u2014your result would still always come up negatively regardless whether one adds beforehand like I chose not too \u2014you get -(Negative Three). Therefore if N > P \u2192 Q(i mean quotient), Subtracting yields Negatives\u2026..So finally put all our previous steps together : Initial Temp (P):    \u21d2      First Change (-Q  \u220d    M\u2212L\u00d7M/D      \u21d2         Second Step(-R)             :: Final ",
        " \u2013 8 = -6 (it\u2019s getting colder). Next apply the second change (-6) increases 3 degree celsius during sunrise time so you can use addition instead of subtraction since it went up. We get -6 + 3 equals negative three or as stated above \u201cthe tempature goes below freezing\u201d . This indicates our earlier conversion made when dealing with cold temperatures isn\u2019t accurate enough; thus leading us to choose one amongst these four options(A)(B), ,C )D because only those choices represent absolute zero values i.e., \u2018freeze point.\u2019 Hence among them none seems correct while also being realistic about weather conditions near/at Earth surface levels except maybe option C(-2\u00b0 Fahrenheit?) could slightly resemble what happens under such circumstances although rarely observed here but generally considered impossible without extremely uncommon factors like cosmic phenomena etc\u2026 But remember before selecting go ahead double check if any other choice might match better too just keep trying until finally finding right solution matches exactly your result=answer=-3degreesFarenheit",
        " negative four or -4 degrees Celsius (since temperatures below zero can go into negatives). Next apply the second statement about this problem happening \u2014the cold air warms up again\u2014so it increases by three degrees Celsius. Therefore, you add those 3 degrees Celsius back onto our current value of -4 degrees celsius and get your solution (-4+3) equaling -1 degree celsius as the correct result. Note when solving these types of problems always follow careful attention to applying operations one operation at a time because if applied incorrectly could lead to answers like \u2018minus forty eight\u2019 or something along those lines!
