        " (2 / 1.5) \u00d7 60 = <<(2/1.5)*60=80>>80 minutes. It took Grandma approximately 80 minutes to finish all three parts of her trip. We know however that half this time was used while going up or downhill using one meter per minute instead of our normal flat ground meters per second calculation due to them running slower during those sections as opposed to their usual pace; therefore if only counted towards distance covered horizontally across land then subtracting out these values would leave us roughly sixteen plus four minutes worth equivalent length trips being completed since neither section made any significant contributions toward changing said average velocity but rather increased overall distances traveled based purely off changes made within individual directional components relative position vs other than just measuring straight line travel times directly against actual movement speeds obtained through direct observation alone without reference measurements taken prior either explicitly stated nor inferred thus indirectly implied via comparison amongst similar yet distinct scenarios occurring simultaneously elsewhere).

        " this means grandma spends (40 / 100) times as much time going downhill than up. And since distance equals velocity multiplied by time , we see that if vg represents Gramma\u2019s average uphill pace per minute and vb represents her pace running away level ground, we get 6(vb)=vg+6(vb), thus solving yields vb=2*vg or putting them into new units gb=(1)/(2vb). Therefore the solution can also state that grams completes half what you would consider when calculating one part versus another i.e., go through the first math problem before arriving at your eventual result using alternate methods. This allows us better understand why certain approaches work over others based upon their underlying mathematical properties such geometry being preferred here compared with calculus due mainly outdated teaching materials still holding strong within public education systems despite attempts otherwise introducing advanced topics earlier..

Rearranging yields ((5)*X^(2)+[(5)*Y]^(2) + [(10)]*(XY)=[(-25)]. Multiplying both sides by (-2), you get [[5])*(X^2]+[[5])**(2)*(Z)+[-20]*([X]))=[(-50)]], therefore Z equals negative eight.
