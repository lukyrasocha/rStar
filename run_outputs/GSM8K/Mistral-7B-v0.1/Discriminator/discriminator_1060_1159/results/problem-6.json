It was mentioned in the prompt that the football team ordered 'twice as many', which means double the amount purchased by the Glee Club hence it\u2019s 2x(Greek Club Pizza quantity), translating into 20 pizzas. Calculate how many slices consumed based on this fact; eighty percent consumption equates mathematic formula [(Football Team Order)(Eightieth Percent)] or [Twice Greek Group Order](Worth Fifty Cents)*[Percent]).

Compute the number of pizzas consumed by the football team by multiplying their quantity order (40) times the portion (80%). Thus, the football team devoured  40 x 0.8 = 32 pizzas. Subtract these numbers both instances from respectively starting quantities; compute remaining unsold or uneaten portions hence we get(from Glee Club\u2019s stand): Remaining_gleesque= Initial_pizza-(Piezo_ate*Initial_Gleesque)=20 -(14x2/10)= 2 Pizzas Unconsumed.(From Football Team): Used remains_football=(Quantity_ordered)*percentageUsed/(totalnumberofitemsatinitiallocation)=(40)-((32)/1)=<<8>> Quantity remain unused. Lastly add together results obtained above so sum_unconsumed:=remains_glesques+RemainersoundtogetourfinalanswersumUnconsumeablequantity.=8 plus 2 equals <<20>> .In conclusion ,the overall consumption equated just below half all initial purchases made.

Subtract these numbers from their original order (20 - 14), resulting in 6 uneaten pizzas by the glee club remaining. Similarly, identify the count of pizzas purchased by the football squad based upon clues provided in the question; here it says 'twice as many,' hence double the initial purchase of those making up the Glee Club (i.e., 20 x 2). This results into a total sum of 40 pizzas initially received by the Football Team. Calculate the consumption rate among members of the athletics group \u2013 again referencing data extracted directly from textual material presented within the query ('a whopping 80 %') so you multiply said percentage against found total purchases (.8 x 40); thus deducing they devoured precisely half all procured items or rather, outrightly consuming 20 amongst the collected supply array available back home post game time meal plan sessions etc..

It says this amount doubles what initially happened when it stated their order 'twice as many'. Hence doubled implies multiplying original count(20 Pizzas), therefore get twenty times 2 equaling 40 pizzas.

Deduce the number of slices ingested by Football Squad via calculating percentages similar method used previously(the Soccer squad devoured 80%, hence it involves multiplication); therefore, take 40 multiplied by 80/100 resulting in consumption of 40*8=32 pizzas by Footbal team but subtract these delicious bites from overall count present firstly obtained above i.e., 40\u201332 leaves behind just eight scrumptious morsels enjoyed solely among those wearing scarlet jerseys during rigorous sports practice sessions!
