Also included new sample calculation demonstrating application principles described employing suitable terminology indicating required computational steps taken ensuring results derived meet requirements specified thereby satisfying criteria delineated preceding mention ..

        " friend at 120%. Thus, his friend paid 120% of what Mr.Rogers had spent ($1500). Therefore, $1500 multiplied by 120%, we get,$1800=$1500 plus (additional cost) . Add up those costs to find out additional amount/percentage discount received by our person compared to seller as well , since this percent would correspond directly to % savings made over initial purchase.. Subtract them:  1500(spent by mr.) -(total expense=   1800-(price offered )=>      300<sub></sub><br />This means my buyermrs spending went down &hence save during transaction process ! We can also write:                          saving         SAVE               Percent Discount            calculate based off new information :$original($)=cost             vs.$new=(final)&x;&fnof;&minus;</font>&fnof=&nbsp;&nbsp ;our calculation here     i know only one way around yet but surely using variables like above or something else ?
