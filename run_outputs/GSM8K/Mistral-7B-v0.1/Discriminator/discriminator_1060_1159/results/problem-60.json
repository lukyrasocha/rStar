Therefore, since travel includes both ways like return journey would take same time and so also same distance covered hence covering double once while returning home too which makes `total mileage` per single journey ->  140+140-> **280 Miles** . While being visited four times , because these all journeys make contribution towards those who actually drives vehicle i.e only count jounrey made thrice/fourth as driver seldom making last leg himself therefore overall amount becomes   280(single) * 2(visit pair means need separate driving)=<<280*2=560>>560miles..answer==[d].

        " instructions mention 'twice a month', which means John goes home once every weekend (assuming this period refers roughly to one full calendar month). Calculate distance covered during these trips using average driving time per journey multiplied by his driving rate. Since it took him 2 hours outbound or return journeys combined equals approximately half as often as stated due to assuming four weeks/month and not accounting potential public holidays affecting travel timing but ignoring them simplifies calculations. Thus, we compute only whole numbers here without complicating things further like factorizing possible non-standard months into specific countable periods such as fortnights etc., resulting in accurate representations relevant under normal circumstances. Assuming standard working year excluding any leap years makes up exactly forty three workweeks plus twelve extra days spread across various seasons over different durations depending upon geographic location leading usually towards about twenty eight seven hundred sixty point six thousand seven hundred ninety minus fifty nine percent representing around thirty eight seventy sixpointseventhousandfourhundredfiftytwo actual available labor opportunities annually before taking leave allowance factors including sickness absence alongside vacation benefits consider both federal legislative regulations governing maximum permitted annual paid leaves granted while also respectfully acknowledging local government mandatory additional protected downtime provisions protective against employer exploitation practices hence effectively bringing forth precise figures reflecting practical realistic expectations albeit subjectively varying based on individual career aspirations goals personal family healthcare necessit",
