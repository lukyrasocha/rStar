Thus their average driving speed over those `$T$ period equals `$25 mph`. I hope that helps! Note that your question didn't include information about whether Sid stopped anywhere along either leg of trip; my solution assumed continuous movement under constant velocity without stops. That might change things depending on reality however \u2013 but please update accordingly :) Also note that any units being compared ought always relate directly when evaluating formulas/equations such as mine ; usually one thing doesn't standalone / independently make sense unless paired appropriately against others\u2026",
        " To find out how far sid went per minute we divide distance which equals (140/180)miles . Simplifying this fraction results into ~0.77milage / min(we multiplied numerator n denominator both by ten). Sid also moved  110milesthis part takes him exactly oneand halfhourso lets multiply it too ,~0.77*90=70 mile sththis means odiss spent altogether approximately seventyfive mls travelling about zeropointseight seven milsperminute . Hencethe correct optionis B : sixtozero point eight sevensixthofalrgeanumbertospeedsatoddsatisfiesourconditions !!! :-)"
