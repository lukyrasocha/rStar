Your calculation assumes every choice is equally probable which isn\u2019t true due to different conditions applied yet results show no difference when calculating individual vs combined probabilities making any further calculations beyond point here useless unless rethought entirely around event specific rules since actual outcome could vary greatly depending upon various factors like preferences etc., including type&size matter too \u2013 maybe even influence behavior slightly over time\u2026so try not focus strictly numerical logic alone; human nature being what it may always need consideration regardless numbers involved!

However if Ellen still somehow keeps one intact among those taken away without knowing about it; otherwise probability is zero because no non-spooky options remain.
