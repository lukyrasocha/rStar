Let me break down the details according to what would typically need comprehensive numerical analysis including initial values, operations like multiplication to calculate individual item totals, summation for grand total calculation which aligns well with common business scenarios dealing directly with revenue recognition through inventory sale without introducing errors due to omission of necessary computational sequencing such as order dependency (for instance, multiplicative scaling prior to additive consolidation).

Therefore, your full calculation would look something like:(6\u00d7$5.50)+[(9\u00d7$11)]+[(20\u00d7$1.50)], which simplifies downto:$33+$99+$30=$23; rounded or estimated correctly! ",
