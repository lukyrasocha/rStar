Subtract this difference out of the whole length since we need to find out what part goes to both parties before splitting evenly; so you subtract 60 / 2(Sam portion)/ Harry portion or alternatively put if one person receives sixy% more its like saying : Total=A+B & B = A*1.(x+0.6).

We combine those like terms to form our second equation or simplification here :   100=2x+60 .

Therefore, divide the original length of the line segment into half portions or \u2018two equal parts.\u2019 Two equal lengths can also mean dividing whatever remains evenly among those who receive lesser amounts. Since we know this piece was initially doubled due only once before distribution happened; therefore these shares make up four sections altogether including both owners/possessors .

Which means Harry gets sixty minus another sixy leaving zero for him! This makes sense because while initially asking about splitting any leftover value wasn't clear, doing away with all remaining portions equates both sides being equally balanced \u2013 no remainder exists. So based off initial values alone only ten percent remains unaccountable without further specifications otherwise known variables such who holds ownership right down too certain areas\u2026or perhaps if its perimeter boundaries included shared space zones etc..

Given these relationships mentioned earlier, our equation becomes S+(S+60)=100 due their combined receipt equaling all available sections respectively.

Solve your algebraic expression (\\(3x=100\\)) first before substituting values back in the original fractional model representation above i.e., \\(\\frac{x+2x}{3}=\\frac{100}{(x+2x)}\\), solve out right side denominator yielding '3'.

Subtracting Samuel having 'x', this leaves us with Harry receiving '(50-x)'. However, because it states Harrie receives '60'(additional), which needs further subtraction making him receive ('[50-(50-x)]'+60)=('x'+60') respectively. Adding together their shares yields equalisation thus leading up to '2*x=50'. Solving subsequently results into X being approximately equal to ~25 (rounded off due to fractional values considered within context.) Hence implying halfway share or original equitable distribution was assigned per person without considering additional premium accorded upon Henry thereby resulting in approximate sum allocated towards Sam stands around ~25 .

Thus, 50=X+60 represents half of their combined amount plus one extra third which belonged to Harry alone (this means that Sam only receives 2/3rd or ~66% while Harry receiving three parts out of four equals approximately about 75%). Therefore, you need twice the difference equation because when multiplied together becomes equal amounts but without additional leftovers being considered so therefore multiply both sides respectively resulting into :  2(x)=3*(y) thus making y=$~[(2*10)/3]~$=(20/3)$~$=6$feet remaining.(Remembering again that due to splitting unequally evenly equalling would result into wrong values if not taken care off first before calculating accordingly using basic math principles!).. ) We know already though since doubling resulted no remainder was found during calculation , hence leaving behind none otherwise ;-) .

Therefore there wouldn't really any leftover since neither could satisfy their agreed upon splitting terms due to excess demand. Thus taking away all surplus part considering necessity instead of ratios , if you distribute what was available evenly amongst themselves without keeping 'extra', Each would indeed receive exactly one third i.e., roughly around ~33.33 Feet per person leaving practically negligible remainder unused..

Solving further leads us subtracting 6 from both sides yields -> 2x = 94 Therefore dividing through by 2 results into -->x = 47 .
