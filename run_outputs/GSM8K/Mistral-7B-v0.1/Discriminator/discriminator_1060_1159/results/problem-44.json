Hence Caroline is twenty four months or eighteen (in numerical terms if we assume a month equals approximately thirty one/thirty days hence approximated upwards till twelve every twelves corresponds roughly to annually i.e.,year), young adult while staying close enough to what would represent typical youthful stages around teenager ages often considered suitable when describing human age without explicit reference to date specific chronological measurement tools like calendars.(However, remember exact measurements can vary depending upon regional cultural interpretations ) But keep in mind these calculations may not entirely align due variations such as leap years affecting temporal distance etc..

But keep mind here we consider \u2018times older\u2019 means just multiply not add extra ages like multiplication factor would suggest normally; hence it stands corrected to mean simply tripled i.e., multiple instead of thrice adding another original value which makes sense if interpreted loosely but usually such terms can cause confusion so clarification asked beforehand could ensure this calculation isn't incorrect considering usual expressions or interpretations when mentioned something similar. That results into multiplying both values obtained together : C*B*(C+3)=4(8)(7).
