Hence dividing our calculated value \\[ \\frac{100}{2}=50 \\] thus if Albie follows same pace i.e., traveling 400kms daily all through ,it takes him exactly fifty(fifty)days to cover equivalent of halfway across the globe when compared against whole trips length!

Let's calculate how far it takes him before reaching exactly the mid point using ratios considering units like miles instead since Kilometers seem large compared to daily flights thus making calculations easier hence converting kilometer into Miles [1km equals approximately .62 mile].
