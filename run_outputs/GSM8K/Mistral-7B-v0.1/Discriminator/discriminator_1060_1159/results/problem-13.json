Since Mr. Robles bought 315 bananas, if we deduct what was used over seven days, it leaves us with remaining amount as follows: 315-(168*7)=  2 banacies. Therefore since its not possible for any single animal or group of animals within those seven days to consume lesser bananas but can only finish them off completely before reaching eight days; It implies therefore that even though the calculations reveal negative balance upon completion of seventh day, when dealing realistically speaking regarding food consumption, no individual consumes fractions/remaining quantities because once finished up their portion entirely without leftovers ; hence ,Third Monkey alone also feeds exclusively throughout entirety (seven consecutive)of seven successive days irrespective whether another partaker ends up emptying out whatever residual quantity remains .

        " both other monkeys (the ones identified) would consume each day combined using multiplication or addition as appropriate. Since it was stated clearly these two monkeys eat four less altogether (than just multiplying their individual intake), we need to subtract this quantity off before summing up what those two consumes together so our calculation looks like follows; To find out collectively consumption rates of all involved subjects multiply(identified subject consumption)(number). Multiply because amounts remain constant every single time you want them consumed thus making your output amount directly proportional too.
