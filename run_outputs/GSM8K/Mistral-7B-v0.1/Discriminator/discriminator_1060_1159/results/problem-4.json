Also according to condition  4, thirty students went to class on Thursdays while twenty-five joined us Founded on Fridays! To find out about what happened during these five consecutive working days we need just sum up visits across every individual morning (as long as I don\u2019t make any mistakes). That means adding our totals together like this one simple equation : Total Number Of Classes(T)=Monday+Tuesday+(Wednesday) +Thursday +Friday Thus , using numerical substitution instead yields\u2026Total No .Of School Clss Visited(TC)=32+64 +96 +30+25 We obtain finally.. Therefore when calculated properly above mentioned steps can determine result effectively Hence \u2026and therefore ..the overall count comes exactly upto seventy seven indeed As such herein lie those answers ...",
        " was 32. It doubled on Tuesday which means it increased by twice its original amount so we can calculate this multiplication problem using mental math or writing down our work (32+32) resulting into 64 classes visits on Tuesdays. This pattern continues up until Wenesday when it tripled over the previous count; hence another round of addition would result into 96 class visitors during the morning slot(Wes). Let\u2019s add together those numbers plus one additional time frame represented by four different counts. Thus , adding these totals :  32  +   64  +  .96  +    30   +      25 results in 207. We rounded off any decimals before doing whole brain mathematics operations since none stated otherwise. That makes your overall correct sum equal just above twenty seven hundred eighty six! And therefore\u2014the correct choice here becomes either Option \u201cA\u201d i)or\" B\". But option 'B'\" being smaller than what you arrived calculated indicates perhaps miscalculations earlier while arriving toward specific values via subtraction process thus need revisiting again based upon mentioned figures within said options themselves too.(i)'Either way both choices seem appropriate though ultimately only require reexamining discrepancies noted among initial & subsequent calculations.)",

Therefore, we first find out the class attendance numbers per respective activities throughout the whole week using these facts presented above before aggregating them together. We know the following things based only off this information provided; hence assuming it doesn\u2019t apply beyond which fact was stated previously when answering such problems:- Monday saw  32 Classes coming.- Since twice as many came compared to those who attended yesterday [Wednesday] means Wednesday witnessed half or about _1_Class less than what happened on both [Monday & Thursday]. This implies ~~that__ since 32 divided by __2=~~16(classes) would mean so but considering one fewer instance occurred during said timeframe resulting into[32-(one)=<<32-1=31>>], thus making another interpretation possible depending upon your standpoint here__. Either way, either conclusion below holds equally valid according to standard reasoning rules unless explicitly specified otherwise regarding any assumptions made.(i.)
