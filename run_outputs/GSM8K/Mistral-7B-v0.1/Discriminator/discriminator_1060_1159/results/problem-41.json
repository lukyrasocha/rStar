But according to conditions it was mentioned their collective distance was equal to half(52/2)=26 miles , which means this statement contradicting previous information! Hence we ignore first part about combined distances . Thus using corrected values : if micah runs three_half*amber i.e 2*(total / amber)+micah=(five_two)*one thusly; one equals ((five_two)/((two+(three_halves)))) or sixteen/(thirty point seven). This answers my question as ahito needs to cover remaining thirty minus twenty eight equalling eighteen .. oh well.. I mean nineteen divided by twelve seventh multiplied again by fifteen hundred so forth ten zeroes till eleven zeros make sixty ... hmmm ????.
