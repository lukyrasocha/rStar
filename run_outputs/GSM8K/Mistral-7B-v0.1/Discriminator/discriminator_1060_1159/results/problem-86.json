At least three things come off table here since prices mentioned above seem unrealistic enough being fixed both ways regardless any fluctuations occurring over period under consideration otherwise\u2026 Here comes first point into play stating fact no mention was ever about taxation so let ignore such detail henceforth leaving remaining calculations involving simple arithmetics like multiplication without taking account those additional overhead costs either paid back through profit gains nor subtracted away thus making calculation quite straight forward!

        " each which means he buys 100 / 5 = 20 rocks. Since he sells 60% of his stock, this equates to him successfully selling 20*0.6=12 rocks. Each sold rock brings him profit (the price difference) of $7-$5=$2 per sale transaction. As such if we multiply out these factors over the successful sales transactions i.e., profits($12) times their respective single priced ($2), therefore ending up having made back just under half what was spent initially since 2*$12=$24 less than original sum would indeed represent losses brought about owing to unsold part of initial capital hence representing unfulfilled potential earnings; finally calculating subtraction yields as follows ;$100-(100-%2)/(initially_spent)$/quantity[representative];i.e.$x=(Initial Spending)*(%LeftUnsold)[remaining portion]. Substituting values into equation reveals following :total loss=-(($2)=($x/%left)-profit[$y])=[loss] [result]=(-$((100*(.4))-$x);simplifying further equals (-$(40$-x)).
