It also mentions one ton equals 20 units (since it carries about this amount), however since we want our output as 'tons', let us redefine unit_weight = kg / unit; hence unit_weight would equal kilograms divided by single piece or item weight which makes sense because if every individual sack contains just over half a metric ton=kilogram(~500kg). Thus we use those values directly without changing anything else except converting into correct mass/unit terms such weights may represent actual physical goods during shipping processes but still remember all numbers used here refer explicitly towards quantities indicated within specified scenario rather generalities regarding standard measures i.e., pounds vs meterage dimensions etc..

Therefore, subtracting this loss leaves us calculating success rate as roughly eighty percent\u2014around fourteen surviving carriers remaining. Given all previous information we can calculate ten thousand plus forty hundred divided by eleven yields sixty point seven thirty three, meaning when round off it would mean seventy tons reaching destination without causing confusion over decimals because pounds cannot fractionalize themselves into such divisions either technically speaking; however upon conversion those decimal numbers translate back accurately while keeping consistency intact within metric standards worldwide too since kilograms already represents base measurement scale thus allowing direct interpretation onto appropriate standardized values across global scales respectively regardless if someone wanted smaller measurements elsewhere perhaps using customary US ones etc., ultimately ensuring uniformity amongst varied methods irrespective national preferences/traditions present among countless countries sharing diverse cultures spanning continents wide ranging borders forming geopolitical communities living together peaceably under international laws fostering intercontinental collaboration essential throughout modern history particularly post World War II era leading towards new eras including digital revolution occurring recently transformative changes accelerated innovation speeds driving ever expanding frontiers forward progress forever pushing limits beyond boundaries known past generations realizing dreams once thought impossible just few centuries earlier during industrial age dawn breaking away traditional ways defining times gone pass creating lasting legacies shaping future course courses chart routes yet unknown destined destinies looming ahead human civilization marches relentlessly advancing boundlessly unstoppable force reshaping every aspect reality encompass whole earth community witness spectacular growth surge prosperity unfold joyous abundant fruitful harvest blossoms vibrant life renews breath freshens essence revitalizes energies awaken hope ignites passion stir soul inspires imagination transcends barriers embracing unity harmonious spirit binds heartstrings embody love express understanding compassion share care nurture create caress bond deep connection touch lives imbue souls empower hearts kindle flames spark fierce desire light paths revealing truth discover answers question curiosity pursued knowledge wisdom accumulate",
