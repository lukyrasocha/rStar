Calculate the revenue generated per product type. To find out this information multiply quantity units times cost unit values separately. For instance calculating the sales revenue made up solely through MTB would look like so QTY_MTB*CST_MTB=$500*105$ which equals exactly $$52,500$. Do similar calculation but instead using respective value pairings for other items namely {Qty_{Trek}: 'VA', Cst_{Trek}: '$450'}\u2192{qtyValue := Va}, qtyValue \u00d7 ccyVal{$450} yields $67,500. And lastly {Quantity}_{bmx}=hpTotalUnitPrice(HourworkCost($250)). This results to ~$11,250 considering round figure approximation methodology when multiplying decimal figures involved herein hence yield resultant sum equalling nearly about four point ten zero thousand dollars approximately approximated thereby.

And finally, trekking bikes sell for about $450 apiece \u2013 thus, again taking into account what was stated earlier regarding only 50 percent representing these items overall: since there were exactly 300 purchased but not necessarily divided equally amongst categories, Marcel took home approximately $(($450\u00d7total))/(percentage)=($(($450)(300)))/(50%); or [(1/2)(450)]\u00d7300=((225)(300)); therefore resulting in approximate profits summing up to around $67,500 if you take everything together along with round numbers used throughout our analysis here).
