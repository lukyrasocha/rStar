To get this figure, multiply units sold over both Mon & Tue nights together multiplying sell value per item times number purchased i.e., $(40)(2+4)$, resulting in a sum sale income equal to $$240$. Calculate Cost of Goods Sold or COGS. This equals our product cost($20)*total items obtained during the weekend period herein implied as 'last Mond&Tue', hence making your calculation $(20*6)$. Subtract Total Revenues By From COG Scalars As stated above when calculating net profits; Net Profit=Total Sales-(Cost Of Gob), following such principle you would subtract $(240)-[(20)$$(\u00d7$$6)]$, yielding a difference resultant set equalling ${\u2212$}.
