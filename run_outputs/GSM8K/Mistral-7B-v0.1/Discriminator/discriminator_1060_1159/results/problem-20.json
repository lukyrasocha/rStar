Therefore, over four hours, a single stream generates 4*3600=14400 gemslitzees. With the participation of all fifteen streams together results becomes 15*14400= 216000 gemslitzees .The answer is: 216000",
        " one jellyfish was produced (per second) by the number of seconds in an hour (which equals 60 minutes times 60 seconds/minute or 3600 seconds). This calculation yields a production amount of 3600 jellyfish per hour per spring. Extending our calculations further, multiply these results by 4 (the specified duration), yielding an overall creation rate figure over four hours as follows: Jellyfish_Production_Rate=Spring Rate*Time Frame=(1 jiffy)*(Hrs)=((1)/Sec)(4 Hr) [(Both 'Per Sec', 'In Hours') units cancel out] so... SpringRATE*(SEC*MIN==HOUR))=> Minutes*Seconds/(Mins*seconds)->(Multiplied both values together divided once again due equal denominators.)This leaves us with the Final Calculation Result : 3600*.4 (spring works entirely throughout entire period producing steady flow!)=1440 JULIA COMPLETED!So according to above derivations if individual sprockets produce exactly half quantity than required ,we get..

        " 3600 jellyfish produced by one spring per hour. Multiply this value by the desired time span i.e., multiply by 4 since the problem asks about four hours: 3600*4=14,400. Finally, as there are multiple springs involved here(i.e., 5), all creating the said amount independently so you just need to add their individual rates together before finding out what gets accomplished within your timeline ,multiply our previous result by '5'. Hence the calculation becomes :  14,400 * 5 = <<14400*5=72000>>72,000 . Therefore, if five springs work simultaneously under these conditions, over the course of 4 hours, approximately 72,000 jellyfish could be hypothetically generated; barring any limiting factors such as survival or environmental capacity constraints etc..
