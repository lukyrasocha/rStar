Simply put once those initial steps mentioned earlier become clear within themselves throughout our explanation process over time their application can only get easier hence less confusing going forward since every aspect involved makes sense regardless who may use certain terminology differently across disciplines etc..

It turns out that a large coupon costs three times as much as its smaller counterpart i.e., 15/5 equals exactly three; thus confirming our previous calculation isn\u2019t just accidental but rather based on proportionality \u2013 making such cross verification crucial especially during complex mathematical operations involving fraction conversions or percentage calculations. Finally though not explicitly asked here yet according tothe procedure mentioned above involves actual multiplication operation(not division). Hence multiply both numbers obtained previously together alongwith respective per-item rates so , summing up all these products yields you your desired resultant!
