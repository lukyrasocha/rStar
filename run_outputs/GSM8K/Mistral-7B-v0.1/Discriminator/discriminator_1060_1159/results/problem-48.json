To find out what you spent overall following all transactions, subtract these savings accordingly ((calculations may involve considering fractions/decimals if necessary) Subtraction results reflect net expenditure): Approximate spending post discount $(($(standard estimated sum before applying promotion)) \u2212((estimated value applied via special deal))) Herein lies our approximate calculation based upon information provided:(~$Approx.(~45\u2212~7)=\u2248$~38) This reasoning assumes minor variances permitted without impacting rounded estimates,(notwithstanding potential non-whole cent denominations),(which might adjust slightly either higher or lower than anticipated depending on actual payment method usage\u2014but generally speaking one won\u2019t encounter such discrepancies when dealing solely with coins & paper notes)(unless specifically stated otherwise though note further elaboration required below.).
