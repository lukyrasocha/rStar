Calculate time taken considering walking downward direction (going towards the destination). Since our rate here refers to units/time i.e., we would need minutes or hours so let us use them as well. Convert all distances into same unit before solving this question because mixing meters(which converts directly against Kilometers)with kilometers confuses calculations hence distribute correctly .

        " 4 mph. Calculate the time taken using Time=Distance/Speed formula as follows; first calculate one direction journey (Home => Store) so Distance(D)=4 Miles Speed(S)=4mph Using Time=(distance)/speed we can get Total Journey Duration T=[home=>store]+[Store=>Home]. Since both distances equals Home=>Store therefore [home=>store]=Total jounrey duration /2 As such our equation becomes.[Home=>Store]T=[Home=>Store]Miles/(Home->Store)->Time Mins=. .",
        " / 4 mph = 1 hour to get halfway (which means 2 miles). Once James reached the house midpoint, this already took up 1 hr before going any further towards the destination i.e., until we consider returning trip time as well. Since distance equals speed multiplied by time, or using rearranged form Time=distance/speed; therefore when reaching half way again which was another setback of covering remaining  2 miles(to go farther), would add additional second one roundtrip making overall duration about twice what you calculated initially without considering detour effect . Therefore : Total_time taken approx. = original estimated journey doubled due extra return portion , thus ~2 times first estimated estimate ; hence around ~2hrrs if excluding effects caused bt rerouting itself.. Or simplistically put simply -- Taking whole picture into account though slightly complex math involved here but still yields similar concept essentially telling us same thing merely expressed differently albeit somewhat complicatedly perhaps intentionally challenging minds trying understand scenario! At bottom line however things boil down quite clearly no matter your choice overlook anything else just focus primarily understanding basics such why adding erroneous elements complicates matters thereby potentially leading misconception whereas simplicity serves better purpose especially starting out learning these concepts!.

Distance traveled before turning around would equal one quarter of this sum which can be calculated via simple division or fractional multiplication such as (D/4) hours times speed S mph resulting into s(D)/4miles.

Since we need the one way trip time, divide this value by both sides because you would return as well (to calculate roundtrip), getting about ~8 hours for the journey. However since only outbound travel was needed initially until finding what he forgot which forced additional walking not mentioned but implied within context without specific values related to returning delay or speed change upon realization, subtracting initial correct direction forward movement estimate based on original query intent leaves us with approximately around '4/4=1' henceforth indicating perhaps just underly intended target single leg duration could arguably simplify down simply to effectively near enough equating closest feasible standard direct transit estimation closer approximate considering all factors yet unspecified except directly relevant stated conditions leading up till midpoint disruption resulting indirect path extension necessity sans immediate exact resolution clarity due inherent incomplete explicit detail specification barring sole essential distances involved; thus approximated optimal estimative singular leg traversal timing yields conservatively inferred resultantly extrapolated probable minimal rounded lower bound provision temporarily default threshold conundrum accommodating assumed potential variables plausibly potentially permissive encompassment nonetheless strictly confined strict numerical boundary limitation adherence mandate dictates despite implicit extraneous data abstraction absence compel obligatory nominal approximation requisite alignment facilitative judicial adjudicative interpretational constraint satisfaction harmonizing procedural analytical methodologically necessitated imperative precision fidelity preservation prerequisites abiding integral directive observance conformability assurance upholding axiomatic logical construct cohesion veraciousness maintain integrity operational effectiveness ensuring system functional robust comprehensive reliability optimum decision quality safeguarding strategic informed rational insightful discernment execution efficiency maximized outcome beneficiation optimization thereby achieving objectives fulfilments advancements enhancement benefits whilst simultaneously promoting organizational interests sustainable development future growth initiatives corporate competitiveness stakeholder confidence cultivation trust credibility affirmation mutual respect partnerships collaborations interconnected synergies progress leveraging opportunities exploiting advantage capitalising investments returns generating revenues profits profit margins shareholders dividends increasing wealth accumulation prosperous financial success achievement excellence distinction leadership exemplary standards benchmark aspiration setting inspiring innovation driving breakthrough transformative paradigm shifts revolution creativity igniting imagination",

Half of 4 miles is 2 miles which took 2/4=half hours(or .5) round trip. Doubled because he made this mistake twice; once when leaving and again returning makes it 2 times 1=2 hours. Thus, it initially looked like he didn\u2019t get far but considering return trips counts also means no matter if stopping along time counted towards overall completion still technically reached location albeit not finished task fully.

        " time spent walking away from home; as previously determined this was one hour (walking forward). Calculate the return trip duration which is also one hour (same speed) since only returning without any additional stops takes exactly same amount of hours compared to outbound journey. Sum up both distances together yields overall elapsed time equaling 1+1=2 hours altogether or twice as far traveled due to roundtrip nature implying doubled required travel distance versus straight path trips.

        " hour (mph). Calculate the time needed to walk this same mileage without any interruptions as if walking directly to the destination from home only once; i.e., Home -> Store \u2013\u2013-> Total Distance Traveled. To calculate Time taken when moving towards Destination we use formula Speed=Distance/Time or rearranged formulate becomes \u201cTime= Distance/Speed\u201d. Thus here \u2018Destination\u2019 equals 'Store', so plugging values into equation gets us :(Total trip)= Home \u2192 Halfway point \u2192 Back to home \u2192 Finally to Store=(Home-->Half way) + [Back --> Home] + ([Back --> Home]+[home-->>store]).
