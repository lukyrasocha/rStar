Oh wait no need anymore could see already figured everything though :( Okay well basically both equations above work fine except maybe factoring division might mess things up somehow depending upon size variance within groupings . Okey go ahead try doing sums manually versus computerised calculators using simple formulas :)))))((( Note also note doesn`tn mention any specific type pf grouping nor why certain terms appear only once whereas others occur regularly thus making calculations difficult ;D Haha good question actually yes indeed please correct me whenever wrong about stuff otherwise ill keep going down rabbit holes forever trying figure mistakes etc unless specifically instructed directly tell anyone else needs explanations hah ahhh jajaaa oh look spotting error myself perhaps worth exploring further whether similarities exist w/ previous examples listed elsewhere !
