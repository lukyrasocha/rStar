To calculate distance let's recall basic Physics formula Distance traveled equals velocity multiplied by elapsed time. Here we want all this information combined together into different speeds within certain parts of our overall trip while also remembering fractional amounts like having someone use only \u2153 part of their motion abilities versus another doing them just enough full power up until completion... But what matters most here isn't actually these complex concepts since we don\u2019t need exact distances covered during those subdivided portions! Instead focus simply upon calculating totals based solely using simple math operations involving addition plus multiplication whenever required throughout multiple steps towards reaching desired outcome result ~~~ ",

According to these specific instructions, divide out your interval of focus \u2014which happened already being reduced down through calculation--into third parts; hence roughly every three periods within it equaling around twenty eight point seven minutes long rather than actual thirty seconds worth segments due ot round up errors etc., thereby equalling about fortyfour percent ((one divided by three) multiplied straight ahead).

This results in `(1/(one // three))*(nine)`, simplifying further to just 'two'.

Therefore within 6 hours including both movements combined ([1 part running+2 parts walking]): Total Distance Covered equals [Running portion \u00d7 Running Speed plus Walking portion multiplied by Walking Speed], hence Equivalent calculation becomes [\\([(\\frac{1}{3}) \\times 6\\]\\, mile + \\; \\( (\\frac{2}{3})\\times6\\)]\\(\\text{ mi/h}\\,)\\); simplifying further yields \\( [(2 \\,mi/\\text h )+(6\\,mi/\\text h)\\, ]\\) equalling twelve distances summed resultingly equivalent to thirty-six manaimled expanses overall",

While walking twice as long implies walking for 2 * (6 / 3) = 4 hours; this distance equals the same pace walked multiplied by its duration i.e., Distance_walking=Pace*duration(W)= Pw*(T-R), since we know W=(T+R)/2 and R=(T-W).
