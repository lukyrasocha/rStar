[/INST]Major Advantage \u2013 Personalization Enhances Brand Loyalty: One significant benefit of employing targeted market segmentation strategies rather than broadly reaching customers through conventional mass advertising techniques lies in personalization\u2019s power to resonate deeply with specific audience segments. When brands tailor their messaging and product offerings to match particular consumer preferences, needs, and demographics, they foster emotional connections\u2014essential drivers of brand loyalty. Customers tend to feel understood and valued, leading them to develop strong affinities towards the brand that reflects not just commercial interests but also aligns well with their identities or aspirations. This level of engagement cultivated via precise positioning often results in repeat business, recommendations, and decreased price sensitivity among dedicated customer groups which overall contributes significantly higher lifetime value relative to widecast campaigns typically associated with less nuanced engagements. Moreover, focusing efforts allows companies to optimize resource allocation resulting in lower cost efficiency while maintaining or even increasing effectiveness due to better ROI measures tied directly to successful interactions with distinctive cohorts.

We multiply former journey by such factor : s*h =>  30miles*(doubletime)= 6hs or 6Hrs Backwards since we know vp / vs = dtb /dtf --> dividing both sides by first fraction yields Dtbn=(Dtpvs)/vtbf thus if velocity doubles amount of times taken grows proportionately when all other factors stay constant ..so tom reaches starting point again exactly at 4PM therefore return trip spanned entire interval minus departure leaving no extra seconds spent arriving early compared too last checkpoint...thus..return took full three plus itself ie four !
