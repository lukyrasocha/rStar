From our starting quantity hereafter subtract all known uses along with those held over which results into only unknown quantities being part of purchase or initially available amount.

We can solve using inverse operations or simplify into a familiar quadratic equation since it only contains one variable but no exponents : -(size of first order)+(amount utilized )=(final count), resulting   80-57=-13.(This result implies however that additional quantities beyond just those already possessed would need to be counted within said collection.)
