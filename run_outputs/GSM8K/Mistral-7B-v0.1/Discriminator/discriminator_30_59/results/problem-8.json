From here add all distances together i.e., 180+90 minutes(running)=270 minutes or three weeks worth so divide them up equally over six days like below we get Speed = Distance / Time ; hence S= 60minutes/(270miles)/6days => Therefore Sarah\u2019s average daily pace comes out to around approx 0.37 mph .

Given it took him six hours to complete these sessions altogether [(first hour)+(two additional same amount)] we know he averages out about thirty seven point four seconds or 0.034 minutes. To calculate speed/rate you need distance divided by time so if we take one minute and divide our rate above into this figure (or any metric unit used herein like kilometers, light years etc.) We see he can travel approximately ninety eight meters during said period making us confident our calculations are correct.[Closer examination reveals average pace actually rounds up closer totalling sixty mile / 20th hrs thus eliminating possibility mentioned above] As asked...we needed only speeds though meaning\u2026when running alone without further data available..but still using metrics previously applied since question required calculating rates within specified bounds instead having exact values yield incorrect results when attempting conversion based upon assumed parameters despite original clarifications not being explicit regarding intentions!

Since we want our result expressed in mph instead if mi; therefore we convert min into hr via dividing them i.e.,  540min divided by sixty equals ten hrs . Finally since speed equals distance over time hence we divide the overall mileage ran(which is fifty eight )dividing thirty thousand four hundred yards by ten equal seventyseven yds/hr.(in terms o f miles/hours , fortyfive would fit better yet still close enough depending).
