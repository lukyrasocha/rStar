One dozen comprises 12 items(ie., candies), so divide totals found above by 12. Thus we get, Number of Dozens= Total Eggs / Size of one dozen   =  1764 / 12   =   147 dozens. Finally multiply output quantity with price set here ($2) using unitary method. Since every dozen costs him $2. Calculate revenue earned via selling all these dozens month wise i.e.; find earnings per week; Price*Quantity. This means Cost=$2*(147)=$294.
