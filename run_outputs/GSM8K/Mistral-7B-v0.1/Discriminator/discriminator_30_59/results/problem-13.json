Substituting into this formula would get us equal portions mass which equaled ((300)/(5))=60grams. Since our desired consumption goal was calculated as being based off remaining caloric intake only, divide both sides of 'one portion energy content[calories] / weight[grams]\" equation by the factor value \"(calories)\" so we obtain [(energy content[calories])/(portion_mass [grams]); i am looking for units proportionality constant k=(Calories/Portion Mass). Calculate K unitless ratio using numbers provided above (k=[calories]/grams)=250/60=. Adjustment here requires dividing right side resulting in ~(x)*K=(desired calorie quota), leaving unknown variable*constant~equal quantity... Solving yields X\u2248(.

Calculate what percentage one single portion represents out of the whole amount; it goes like so : Divide individual portions worth/whole ; This means divide(the previous value) /divide(servings)/which returns roughly around .2 or 20%. Hence calculate half of remaining allowable consumption; multiply current calorific limit minus previously met ones divided as above.(daily targets reduced below them yet still able take up remainder); result here would come off somewhere near  20% multiplied furthermore (.2)*((remainder)=totalcalories-(currentvalue)) equalling approximately   40g which could get me close to my goal without surpassing dietary boundaries while also allowing indulgence once everywhile!
