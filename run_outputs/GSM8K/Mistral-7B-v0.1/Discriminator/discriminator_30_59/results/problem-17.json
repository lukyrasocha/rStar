        " ties (because price doesn't matter here). However we also need to consider their different prices; if red tie costs 50% more than blue one, this means it costs $40*1.5=$60 per piece so he actually spends only ($200+$400)/($40*$1.5)=$80/blue which altogether comes up to equal exactly nothing due incorrect assumption about original question\u2019s meaning \u2014 assuming all tied together instead just calculating separately. But correct way would rather find out summed dollar amount regardless quantities or colors hence combined expenditure equals simply initial investments without adjusting based on relative quantity differences or pricing differential implying single value representing totality irrespective additional specifications mentioned thus correctly calculated amounts culminate respectively into solely basic aggregated fund allocation equating precisely identical monetary valuation across various segments yielding aggregate nonvariable cash influx equivalent resulting uniform financial commitment disregarding individual variances thereby enabling accurate determination regarding overall fiscal dispensation exclusive evaluation limited exclusively towards respective categorical allocational precision whilst preserving underlying constant currency flow unaltered ensuring cohesive consistency within overarching budget management paradigm subsequently achieving fidelity integrity safeguarding authentic economic forecast accuracy accordingly reinforcing strategic decision optimization facilitating optimal resource utilization maximizing operative efficiency optimizing output potential sustainability promoting institutional longevity advancing enterprise prosperity guaranteeing shareholder satisfaction securing market relevance upholding stakeholders interests protecting consumer welfare supporting regulatory compliance aligning corporate social responsibility efforts catalyzing community development fostering inclusivity championing human rights advocacy driving environmental stewardship spearheading innovation leadership positioning firm advantageously influencing positive societal change contributing toward global progress shaping collective destiny creating legacy impact transforming industry norms redefining future horizons revolutionizing commerce practices establishing benchmark standards setting high ethical barriers inspiring emulation among peers propelling sector evolution elevating performance expectations instilling competition healthiness pushing creativity stimulating ingenuity accelerating technological leaps empowering pioneer spirit fueling breakthrough discoveries surging forward momentum galvanizing excitement generating enthusiasm igniting passion building energy mobilizing action sparking transformation provoking change triggering evolution nurturing growth harvesting",
        " ties ($40 per tie), this means he purchased $200 / $40 = 5 blue ties (and therefore also purchases 5*2=10 red ties). Red ties cost 50% more; so these cost 1.5*$40=$<<1.5*40=60>>60 each. This makes them worth $60x10=$<<60*10=600>>600 altogether. Combining both types yields $200+$600=$<<200+600=800>>800 entirely invested into ties. The answer is: 800. Let\u2019s dig deeper! Here we calculate firstly what was initially asked \u2013 which talks about spending only $200 on blue ties while actually investing it all including buyings of less expensive ones too but since we didn't know their prices yet neither could make any deductions regarding whether or not those amounts affected our result already mentioned during calculation making such details moot anyway.
