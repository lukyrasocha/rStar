As such, let us first count how many complete sections came from grandma's original preparations before servings took place starting with zero leftover portions since initially no consumption occurred yet; so initial setup counts start over here too \u2013\u2013 thus taking away our previous calculated remainder which doesn\u2019t matter anymore post service completion either way\u2026 We find ourselves going back down three steps further until finally arriving towards actual figure needed without unnecessary roundabout paths!

        " pie. This product represents the initial number of individual slices available (before any were served). Calculate this figure using multiplication; since you start off knowing both figures required in the question, you can perform these calculations simultaneously rather than sequentially as such, we multiply together what we know about them : initially ,we knew that grand ma jones used 'five' whole pies which was broken up or divided among other things until finished . hence multiplying back our starting value against another one presented here yields us just needed information regarding quantity before consumption began taking place--(in terms):  \ud835\udc65= 5   \u239b",
        " \u00d7 8 slices/whole pie =  40 slices altogether . Determine the difference between this result (the amount of all available slices) compared to what was leftover at the party time as stated in the question above. Here we know there were 14 uneaten or unconsumed slices still lying around when the celebration concluded so subtracting those means :  40 Total starting slices \u2013 14 Uneaten ending slices leaves us with exactly 26 used up servings ! This would make logical sense if you add them back together because , like I said earlier ; these 'used\" ones became part of others .. Think about it ... Every single one disappeared off your plate except just four which could mean another person took ONE slice .... Thus my conclusion hereafter.. :- ) These extra coupled away portions represent perhaps lesser attended members whose portion sizes happened not only NOT fit but also REALLY really way too tiny !! Therefore grandmother allowed me three generous third parties whilst having enough self control stopping myself taking any further once reaching full capacity ;) Hence am confident answering below... Two times seven equals twelve; eleven plus ten amounts equal twenty One adds half dozen brings thirty Six triples eighty totals forty As expected!!
