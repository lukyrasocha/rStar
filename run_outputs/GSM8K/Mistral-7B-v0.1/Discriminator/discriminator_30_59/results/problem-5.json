This suggests Mike most likely completed no full game within these initial 40 mins thus all available scoring opportunities could reasonably equate to equal numbers i.e., both serving & receiving respectively up until their respective ends without any extra turns missing out \u2013 especially since halfway through serves tend not get interrupted unless something unexpected happens..

That seems like a little confused math here; let me try again... It appears we made an error calculating the additional points based upon scoring a 'quarter greater.' Let us simplify into steps following correct mathematical procedures. Understand that if something grows by twelve percent ('twenty') compared to its base value of forty units --which corresponds accurately since our initial reference unit [X] being tied directly correlating as such\u2014our new increment thus represents fifteen (*[twenty]*(*[base][*]/ten)* => [4]+[6]) hence bringing forth a cumulative sum of nineteen ([4)+[15]).
