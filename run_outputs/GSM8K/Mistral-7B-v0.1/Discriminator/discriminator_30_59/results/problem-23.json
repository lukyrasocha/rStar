On Friday though, only fourteen car tyres were fixed so this resulted into 4*40 equaling 160$ but no extra cost since none of them required fixing or upgradation thus making their net gain amount lesser than what it used to achieve when fixiung both types off vehicles(truck &car), hence; $520-$160=$360 More revenue earned on one specific date i.e., Thursdays compared to another occasion as per the problem statement can be obtained simply subtracting values resulting above($160) consequent upon single vehicle category maintenance/maintenance activity viz.(cars)/replacement costs ($40 per piece vs [potential] increased expense during Trimmed down timeframe(incomplete data)). Since we assume here uniform rate throughout all undertakings undergone irrespective whatever could possibly change otherwise while doing same job again such instance would lead towards lower gross return instead because usually things tend move upwards especially if dealing something complex requiring various components like nuts bolts threads etc..

It can also be verified via following statement:-\"however,' didn\u2019t fix anything.\" This sentence implies that not even one vehicle could possibly match up those values so technically no chance existed whatsoever because nothing matches or goes beyond highest figure i presented earlier(dollars).

Moving onto friday when he only worked on fourfold car motorcycles but didn't work out anything related either using the wheelhouse or rear doors .....

This demonstrates just before adding them ... our guy brought through twice less than the previous afternoon ((($ $480)-($ $520)=)$-$80 lower !!!! To conclude : When comparing these last amount figures it comes clearly seen the preceding evening bore most fruit ; its overall figure standing slightly above what arrived via those performed upon Fridays. Consequently therefore accordingly stating..\"He earned eighty bucks further during Wednesdays compared against what came forth throughout Saturdays!\" Thus ultimately ....one can claim correctly indeed.....That their gains occurred substantially enhanced whenever employing services within Tuesday rather versus making use associated Saturday undertakings!

Next, we know that on Friday, all but one job was fixing a car tire which costs him no profit (since not charging anything) while it cost him another $40 per car being replaced or restored as stated above.

Because this isn\u2019t zero yet \u2013 therefore ($6+$x)>=0 makes our goal simpler enough; thus let us assume equal spending herein $((6+y)(40)). To get maximum/minimum value consider setting y=(total pairs)/2 because such pairings maximize revenues over other combinations due their optimal use case scenario nature! Calculate using both sides & compare results before reaching conclusions about most profitable outcome option outcomes .
