        " Calculate the distance which corresponds to throwing the javelin thrice without any item based on those conditions since 'thrice'. It means multiplying current range (without gems) by 3 i.e., Distance= Range*3 , hence here we need distanced thrown like this -> `Range*`(no matter if armed or not), thus => No Gems --> Javelins Thrown Like--> `(Distances)*3`, so ==> `Distance`==>(with no items)= >>>>~<<<=>>```=(No Items)` ==>\r",

This means without any hindrance or additional power provided by other factors like wind direction mentioned previously (those distractions don\u2019t apply here), while carrying the gemstone, Polly can throw the javelin \\(400 \\times 3\\) which equals \\[400\\times 3=1200\\] feet. However, since percentsages aren't allowed as we deal just with raw numbers so no need to consider them yet. Dragons range up to  1000ft , thus Polly if standing nearer one thousand foot point(i,.e) inside but very close would still get hurt because even though being abled to shoot thrice distant away due to gem stone; however mere presence proximity makes harmful! Hence considering safe zone till max danger levels under control area defined around creature including actual limits considered beforehand ; ~~we subtract safety radius also leaving buffer space along way~~ hence taking account entire length scale avoidance safeguards .

        " Since this exceeds the range up to which the dragon can breathe fires (which is 1000 feet), we find out the maximum safe standing place as follows; We subtract the original throwing capacity minus thrice itself, i.e.,  1200 - 400 = 800. Thus if Poppy wants to safely aim while carrying the stone without being caught off guard, Polly needs to stand no closer than around 800ft away. ",
