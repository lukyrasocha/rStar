Hence we conclude that Peter could only afford going exactly thrice while maintaining within budget before exhausting funds entirely as any additional trip would exceed or equal expenditure beyond revenue.

Also note those situations arise when assuming negative integer results such instances signifying possible unfeasible scenarios like spending nothing over multiple shows yet still possessing ample cash reserves whereas clearly illogical because ultimately all available assets would eventually deplete barring further transactions yielding additional capital infusions into current coffers making non-zero integers solely appropriate responses aligningly depicting realistic conditions fitting within established premises allowing verification via simple arithmetic calculation validating coherence wthin stipulated parameters hence ensuring correct logical sequencing preserving truthfulness throughout process maintaining integrity reflective genuine contextual relevance enriching authenticity whilst eschewing fallacies consequently solidifying trustworthiness upholding consistency affirmatively substantiated through mathematical computations thereby delivering accurate conclusions mirroring factual reality",
