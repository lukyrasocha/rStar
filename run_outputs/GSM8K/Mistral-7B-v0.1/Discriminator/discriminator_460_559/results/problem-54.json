However if you directly calculate what % of full price each part represents (house being tripled over other) instead of just simply dividing original quantity equally; It means Lot : House :: 1 part : 3 parts which overall sums up to Total Cost -> 1+3=4 Parts i.e., Full Price / Combined Quantity Per Part (*for ease calculation here use whole numbers*)==>$120,000 divided by respective totality becomes ($120K Divided By Four)->($120k Multiply By One)+(Total multiplied four time less one quartering->$120,000/$4).

To find out \u2018L', we can divide both sides by four; therefore, L= ($120,000)/(4), leading us to conclude L= $30,000 for the Lot Cost. Multiply this result by Three since House Price equaled thrice than the plot or land value equals Total Housing Price over Four minus Land Value i.e., Meaning $(120,000)*{3}/{(House+$lot)} , Which also leads us to obtain $90,000 representing our initial solution stating exactly how expensive the Building/Main Property part was!
