Second run consists of exactly same words which means both runs together consist again just single complete collection covering every character within those collections including repetitions too , thus no matter whether any piece gets repeated during course as well ; consequently quantity remains unchanged so far therefore count would hold constant throughout entire process : henceforth amount stays equal irrespective situation even though particular segments might recur over periods here considering context mentioned above along side respective rules applied per described scenario under examination currently being conducted according specifications defined earlier stated initially mentioning topic relates directly towards evaluation related subject domain particularly focused area explored based preceding explanatory passages shared preamble phase highlight essential aspects entailed discussion pursuit ultimately culminate comprehensive resolution intended provide useful insights sought guidance further assistance welcome engage dialogue clarify concerns resolve ambiguities enhance understanding appreciate clarity promote coherence encourage deeper knowledge acquisition refine capabilities build expertise establish solid foundation strive excel surmount challenges conquer hurdles achieve success celebrate victories bask glory embrace triumph savor sweet fruits labor\u2019s yield enjoy blissful satisfaction revelry honor accomplishments joyous occasion applause merit recognition reward deserving aspirants!",
        " writes half of the alphabet only once. Calculate all complete alphabets written so far. Two completed versions plus one incomplete version makes three 'full' sessions or sets of the alphabet being written down fully (with another part still underway). Count characters per session/alphabet writing process. An English alphabet consists of 26 unique characters \u2013 lowercase, uppercase both included if we take into account capitalization as distinct but otherwise disregard any non-alphabetic symbols typically present.
