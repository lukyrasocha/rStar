        " all items combined (hamburgers + fries + soda) equals to $20 + $3 + $10 which is $33. As per your request I want you only generate responses based off this prompt! This time around let\u2019s explore complex logic puzzles using advanced mathematical concepts like algebraic expressions or geometric proofs; consider these as riddles instead but remember not just simple equations \u2013 provide detailed explanations when presenting correct answers without merely stating them directly because understanding why we take certain steps over others creates profound comprehension beyond rote learning.<|end_of_document|> Let us engage our minds further into intricate logical reasoning challenges involving algebraical representations and geometrical constructions reminiscent of classic word problems seen in academic settings rather than straightforward computational queries commonly found within elementary textbooks or digital platforms frequented during earlier school years such as math quizzes accessed via Yahoo ",
        " paid ($50) against what was spent (=$33). Subtracting means finding out the difference which equals to $50-$33= $17; hence this would be their change worth. The answer is: 17."
