This was our first example which included fractional amounts ($4.7 / hour) so instead we can modify it like below . What if John earns twice every month but loses half during vacation time? To calculate what would happen when adjusting these values you perform the following calculations: Initially, let us assume that Earnings = Hourly Wage \u00d7 Number of Working Hours per Month; We know here that 'Hourly wage\u2019 stays constant while \u2018Number of working hours per month\u201d changes overtime.
