Compute the saving rate per day based off prior information provided about earning or receiving income through work or other methods. This means every single day (from Monday till Friday presumed as working weekdays etc.) contributes towards reaching that shortfall identified above($8). To find out exactly when/how long would happen firstly determine overall duration without considering breaks using division operation thus dividing your target value (=difference calculated earlier) over individual contribution amounts(amount received upon completing one entire set task): Time=Target Value/$Per Task Hence you can simply divide $8 (Total Needed Money)/$2 Per Day Amount Received Each Evening During Job Or Homework And Conclude It Will Take 4 More Days Of Consistent Earninng At Rate Before Buying Desired Toy Car Consider taking into account unforeseen circumstances like missed opportunity due perhaps vacation periods during holidays weeks amongst others..

To calculate this we subtract what was initially available ($4) versus the desired sum of cash required i.e., $12 minus $4 equals $8 still needing saving. Divide the necessary additional funds divided among dollar amounts allocated monthly; specifically here mentioned as every single working day, so divide this value($8), against your allocation per day(i.e.,$2); eight divided by twenty results into four days time frame until goal fulfillment completes\u2014concluding conclusion would require patience over extended duration thus leading us towards choice b representing optimal solution amongst provided options within contextual framework.

Finally, determine time needed based on saving rate per day; since the allowed children saves $2 daily according to this question, divide required extra funds to reach goal($8)/daily earning_rate ($2/day)=$8/$2=4 days. It would thus require four additional or successive days until enough cash was gathered. This can also simply be calculated directly as follows: Each subsequent day brings in one dollar towards reaching the target summed up till previous totals, starting off with three bucks plus adding all further collected sums into our calculation such that after first collection(day+money): Day1 [total:$6], second[total:$8]\u2026etc.. Until eventually having reached last day when collectively amassed deposits equal exactly requested figure ([finalDay]:Total[$8].
