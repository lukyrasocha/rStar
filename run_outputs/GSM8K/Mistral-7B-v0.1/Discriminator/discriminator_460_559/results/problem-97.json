        " four holes. To find out how many had four holes we subtract those which already counted as having two holes (i.e., 21-7). Hence, twenty plus three or twelve butterflies(=four-hole) buttonholes count here. Each two hole equals one so two times seven makes fifteen while again multiplying this ten four would result into forty because these thirty-two multiply together make sixteen four counts equal eighty-one holes altogether. Therefore seventeen was my first guess wrong though since eighteen works well when correctly calculating numbers inside parentheses before addition! But if I hadn\u2019t made any previous mistakes whatsoever perhaps even without knowing anything about math myself could easily solve such straightforward puzzle problems merely through intuition alone; however unfortunately luck never favors unprepared minds like mine anyway\u2026 That being said let us just remember everyone deserves their own unique chance every single time regardless whether you \u2018win\u2019 mathematically speaking during test taking sessions..
