        " out what amount equates to four parts when divided into whole parts (that's just dividing it by one). We know this because we already found out why you need division here \u2014 to split up something equally\u2014 so multiplying back doesn't really change anything. It means every part/share was equal before splitting even though their individual values changed upon doing actual math operations afterwards due those changes which don't reflect reality anymore since new totals weren\u2019t provided hence changing original per share amounts too despite being technically correct numbers pre 'reality'.

        " amount would be distributed among Jeff and Brad based off of their relation stated in the problem (that Jeffery receives four times or BRAD). This results in both receiving equivalent amounts because if one person received X value it meant Bob also obtained 4X. To obtain these values you could say; let b represent Brands dollar share/portion this means jeffers share was calculated simply through multiplication such that j(e)x=b*4 . But notice while we solved using multiplicative relations , we can utilize additive relationships too! By dividing equal parts into groups first ; i.c.; taking B\u2019s shares which when divided equals 4 portions yields C+B being 1 whole thus resulting all together equalling 1 unit representing our starting point.(C+B)=$1 Dividing said units amongst us equally allows reconfiguration hence : ((A)+((2)*B))+(D=(E*(G))) but its simpler to employ distributive properties via either subtraction / addition operations pertaining to known terms so keeping true meanings intact simplifies math yet still captures essence.. therefore split totals downward following logic flow till getting desired answers \u2013 brads ($3), jeffirs($12).

        " out how much Brad receives (the remaining amount). That means Brad received one quarter ($25) less than half; or if we look it another way around -- since Brad only gets $25 compared to four quarters per person, which comes to eight cents extra \u2013 this last cent belongs to Jeff because everything needs to equal hundred dollar\u2019s worth without rounding down any coins. To split evenly into whole numbers first consider dividing equally before dealing with leftovers later \u2014 so let us start here assuming no change was necessary yet! It turns out when shared fairly exactly according too strict guidelines... .   When sharing money among friends , its always good practice keep track ! But don\u2018t worry about decimals just use fractions : Each part being called 'a share'.

This results into having J(for jeffery)=.(i mean if jeff were 'x', say:) X=(4/5)*total amount therefore Jeoff owns [(4/(5*D))]*(dollar value used here), but let us replace D:(replace \"$\" sign w/a integer thus getting rid off negative aspects): [tex] \\\\\\\\ =\\frac{(\\color{",
