We need further information regarding it before calculating how many fewer coffees Joe needs to consume following advice from Dr. Mike (to go down only to four cups). Thus no definitive calculation can happen based off current data provided. An example solution might look like if Octavia was consuming one cup per day being twice less than the average consumption rate which equals three. Therefore when Jose reduces himself back to just over the norm i.e., around 4; That would mean reduction due to decreased recommendations amounts approximately roughly about minus once or zero since subtracting them results in essentially equal numbers. However these figures depend largely upon understanding implied context behind phrases such '\"half\" & various terms used\". Moreover also relies heavily alike personal habits/preferences too!

Half of these 8 cups means Octavia consumes 4 cups per day. We know Juan currently exceeds this amount\u2014he drinks '10 times what octavia drink'. As such, we calculate Juan's current consumption rate based on Octavia's share being equal to 1/10th of his own. Thus when calculating backwardly considering our assumptions, Janus consumes 10*4=40 cups. However, since Joe needs to cut down his consumption to meet the recommended intake only, we figure out how far off Josean goes from reaching 40 cups towards achieving exactly one full serving (the equivalent proportion here): Given fourteen servings remain unaccountable before getting fully aligned with medical advice so subtract eight standard measures leaving us just underneath six units short i.e., Drinking around thirty seven plus three sixth cakes fewer amounts brings about alignment within boundaries set forth visibly explicit through wordy narrative portrayed thusly making up ten percent lesser relative proportions thereby reducing unitary count by said fractional portion hence providing approximate solution .

To achieve optimum efficiency while maintaining sustainability it would therefore seem fitting if we consider adjustments towards lower but multiple intermediary settings rather than just one drastic reduction across board changes.\" As mentioned earlier assuming original ratio values based off conventional standards; let R represent Recommended Daily Coffee Cups & Qx represents Total Drinking Quantity Per Day , respectively ; hence Equation Eqn(a) indicates : Qt=[RecommendedDailyCups][Multiplier]=OriginalIntake /[R].

But according to conditions 3 & 4, if Juan reduces down to just equaling the standard daily recommendation i.e., equivalent to four 'units', he needs to cut off eight fewer units (= 20 current minus ideal value) out of his habitual consumption level. Therefore, Juan requires cutting back further than the difference caused due to excess above suggested guidelines; namely ,it isn't merely about getting himself under fourteen instead of twenty .It addition implies decreasing whatever overconsumption past ordinary parameters already existed before enforcing limit based strictly upon official guideline figures itself even without adding prior overspill into account..
