Because it mentions Anne is twice as young as Alyana but also says \u2018she is X [twice]', which implies Anne would likely have doubled/tripled ages or relationships rather being 'X times younger'. Therefore assuming one possible interpretation could mean Annie might hold half the lifespan duration relative to what average human spans out to generally reach when fully mature such us dividing our previous result by 2 , hence Anne age = Alyana_Age / 2 = <<10-4/2>> .
