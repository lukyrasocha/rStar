Therefore if you assign all these individuals equally; Their collective potential together equals twice what a solitary painter could accomplish alone within those limits since adding employees directly multiplies productivity due to divided labor responsibilities among them i.e., doubling efficiency rate thus effectively halving completion times considering identical contributions across different operators assigned concurrently during operational periods as long as no overtime or exhaustion impedes efficacy levels required being maintained uniformly throughout collaborative workflow duration stipulated hereinafter.

        " so assuming full efficiency (no breaks), this translates into working every single hour. With 5 painters instead of just one, we could cut down time roughly four times which results in them taking about 1/4th as long i.e., approximately 5* .25= ~1.25 days or equivalently 32hours because  24hrs(one day) goes into 1.25days~ 24 hrs/day * 1.25days\u224832hours.
