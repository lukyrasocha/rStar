Therefore, combining both add up to get a resultant of 6+15=21 cents every week. Since we need a figure over a duration of weeks, specifically months here; multiply this daily income rate(i.e., 21 cents/week) times its frequency during timeframe under consideration i.e., one calendar month consisting normally around approximately forty-two days or nearly seven consecutive full weeks considering no interruption as such. Hence multiplying it yields about 21x42 yielding roundabout amount equal to 882 cents when rounded off close enough assuming standard calendars usage without accounting holidays interruptations etc. ",
        " so three would amount to 3*2=6 cents per week just for the cans. Similarly, the cost of one plastic bottle which contains 'five', amounts to (3*5)=15cents every week. Added together, grayson makes or gains 6+15=21 cents per week through these activities combined.
