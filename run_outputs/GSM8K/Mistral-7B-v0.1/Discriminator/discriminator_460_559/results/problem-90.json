We also add $12 (one calculator) plus another $10 (for one geometry set), equaling $12 + $10 = $22. To find out the original subtotal before applying any discounts, we sum up these amounts\u2014$7.50 (notebooks) + $0.50 (pens) + $12 (calculator) + $10 (geometry sets). This totals to $20 when simplified. Since the store offers a 10% off sale across all their products, subtract this percentage as well; specifically, multiply our previous result ($20) by ten percent or divide by hundred \u2013 thus resulting in no change since zero multiplied anything always results into nullness/zeroness like zero times anything equals nothing regardless. However, if you want us only consider taxable purchase amount instead calculation using base product prices directly adding them again ignoring initial sales policy(which may cause misleading financial analysis hence why better practice): You simply just list down individually priced goods first($7.5+0.5+$12+$10=$30); next perform decimal calculations according rule mentioned above-(finding 'ten%' means getting division quotient equivalent value among whole numbers obtained earlier upon addition such instance here takes form being exactly twenty cents less than entire monetary expenditure expectedly prior considering full retail offerings including possible reductions provided via promotional strategies employed within stores themselves thereby rendering said approach seemingly plausible despite potential flaws inherent due unrealistic representation stemming its very essence ).

Adding this together we get 7.5 + 0.5 which equals 8, but since these three prices apply before any discount or taxes (or change), we need to add them up first and subtract their sum as part of the calculation. Also note only basic arithmetic operations allowed here!
