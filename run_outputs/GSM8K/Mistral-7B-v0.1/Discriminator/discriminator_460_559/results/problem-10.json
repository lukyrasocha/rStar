Since it mentions prices being equivalent whether you buy individual units or multiples but implicates additional multipliers due to quantity ('triple ... plus another halved set'), let us break down those equations accordingly. Knowing all these details allow calculating accurately despite lacking actual dollar amounts directly specified within prompt textual description itself \u2013 no numerical values offered yet!
