Subtract the summed tasks accomplished both on Mondaysue plus Tuesdaysue i.e subtract them altogether so calculate again first find out the cumulative task totaled on Monday and Tuesday combined likewise combine all those activities together thus 12+36=Total work executed within duration of Monday&Tuesday yields ten eighty four.

Ultimately though once again remember chronologically always count forward not backward meaning let us consider three critical factors here :   Firstly knowing early mornings generally tend towards lower activity levels compared earlier evenings thus potentially resulting fewer hours available within said timeframe leading unto less work accomplished under such circumstances    Secondly being aware certain tasks may inherently require longer periods than others dependent upon their nature complexity amongst other variables     Third factor pertains specifically dealing w/ school assignments requiring completion during designated classroom instructional timeframes often constrained via predetermined deadlines imposed primarily based around academic calendars schedules etc..

Hence ,on thursday ;he needs just twenty minus seven \u2026=eleven....!!! To clarify : First calculate how long it took until you get down to three quarters...Then simply go back using multiplications instead of division..so dividing even further isn't necessary! This strategy works well especially if your starting point doesn\u2018t involve fractional values\u2026like when working out percentages etc Where needed add additional constraints like extra info such detail being relevant/notrelevant.....and make sure these types come handy later during discussions because they provide clues towards solving certain partofanexistingproblem !!!
