Therefore we can calculate all four people below who contribute most significantly using this equation; ((height difference)+weight)/(average woman\u2019s weight) or equivalently it becomes just taking into account individual differences in mass not factors like posture etc.: (((tall)-shortness)+mass )/(avewoman\u2019s weights); here avgwomansweights~avemiddlensize*AvgHumanWeight=(175 cm)(70 kg)[to keep things simple].

But ok\u2026 well basically whatever case applies general idea remains same even though actual measurements may vary depending upon precise conditions encountered under certain scenarios otherwise stated generally speaking smaller body parts tend towards heavier relative proportions thus impacting stability overall hence why small persons often struggle balancing objects especially longer ones versus big statured individuals whose large frame provide solid foundation allowing greater freedom movement plus extra leverage strength benefits during pushing pulling activities \u2013 important thing note however before calculating ratios involves considering both vertical & horizontal dimensions simultaneously whereas merely looking solely vertically might lead erroneously conclude incorrectly calculated ratio therefore avoid blind spotting potential errors caused lack complete understanding whole picture importance concept regarding scale factor effects relates primarily physical laws governing mechanical energy transfer principles namely conservation principle conserving net momentum force vectors interact together thereby maintain balance equilibrium system dynamics ensuring everything stays stable throughout operation periods regardless whether working solo individually against massive external forces resisting natural motion resistance causes acceleration increase frictional losses kinetic energies converted thermal output excessive heat generation ultimately leading breakdown failure damage unless proper compensatory adjustments made accordingly reducing strain unnecessary stress placed onto machine components specifically gears brakes motor assembly bearings coolant radiator hose connections pipes valves fluid pumps pressure regulators sensors transducers actuator mechanisms control systems feedback",

Also note however another approach would involve using specific numbers when attempting such calculations thus producing different results depending mainly factor differences within participant population dynamics themselves regarding statistical deviation versus standard deviations especially considering factors like athletic performance improvement over years vs initial capability levels etc .
