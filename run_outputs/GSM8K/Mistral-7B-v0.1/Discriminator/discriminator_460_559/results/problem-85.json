        " daily travel amount (one way). As stated, it would take him 3 miles one time since he can only walk either direction per trip home or to work. This implies three trips out before returning so these journeys totals six(double) the initial single journey hence, add another thirty minutes.(since halfway already accounted as mentioned above.) Therefore identify necessary roundtrip duration; multiply distances accordingly .Calculate required overall distance based on frequency using suitable methodology hereinabove described such mannerly expressed via relevant formulae like doubled original mileage multiplied again once its count becomes equal due duplicated occasions which occurs regularly throughout typical professional working schedules involving multiple departments involved within organizations thereby requiring repeated transportation arrangements especially through public transit systems during peak hours along main thoroughfares connecting major landmarks across city centers including but not limited among other notable examples those provided below namely Manhattan Brooklyn Queens etc plus others lesser known alternatives perhaps somewhere beyond even farther afield depending upon your location specifically geographic vicinity surrounding nearest train station whilst still maintaining adherence towards acceptable standards set forth currently recognized worldwide thus establishing universal compliance amongst various sectors ranging anywhere possible spanning everything globally regardless whether domestic foreign national citizens alike residing alongside them permanently until departure finally arrives destination terminal exit point therefore ultimately reaching termination boundary crossroad intersection roadways converging onto subsequent side roads leading eventually toward respective destinations designated solely reserved exclusively dedicated merely shared collective ownership community membership organization/council governing body overseeing general operations managed internally handled externally outside entity external agency governmental authority nonprofit corporation foundation charity club association group team effort collaboration cooperative joint venture enterprise partnership relationship business dealership financial institution banknote currency loan deferment interest rate credit default swap derivative contract security settlement arbitrator mediator negotiators bargainer broker trader intermediary salesperson supplier customer buyer consumer patron investor speculator capitalist entrepreneur owner shareholder stockbroker lawyer advocate counsel representative attorney barrister prosecutor judge magistrate clerk examiner witness observer researcher analyst consultant statistician economist demographer social scientist psychologist sociologist anthropologist political science historian philosopher ethicist moralist humanitarian activist feminist ecofeminist postmodernist liberal conservative libertarian classical radical progressive reactionary antifascism",
        " to work once every time period mentioned (every day), which means we need to calculate this over 5 separate instances since it asks about working 5 times a week. Therefore multiply four twice because you count both going to work as well coming back home: three miles multiplied by itself plus another one mile walked per trip equals six miles roundtrip or simply forty eight inches rounded up makes sixty four feet when taking walking speed into account . Calculate using units consistently calculated correctly so accuracy isn't sacrificed even further than what would normally occur without careful unit conversion first before attempting actual calculation : seven trips take carelessly converted only produces seventeen instead twelve equal distances require doubling those numbers while ensuring all measurement standards remain uniform throughout your analysis , leading finally here towards finding our desired solution 'the correct result lies beyond mere numerical representation but also contextual understanding within physical reality.' However upon reviewing my initial assumptions regarding these specific parameters related specifically toward pedestrian velocity ranges associated typical individuals likely encounter during travel via foot paths/routes commonly found near residential areas versus commercial districts including considerations like pacing rates correlated directly against environmental factors affect human locomotive efficiency thus determining suitable metrics utilized accordingly thereby facilitating accurate estimative methodologies employed hence ultimately establish validity groundings relative measurements acquired earlier described whilst maintain adherence best practices governing scientific inquiry protocol application therefore verification processes applied encompass statistical comparisons derived results subsequently performed evaluations conducted based respective hypothesis testing procedures adopted followed suit confirmatory analyses executed predicated primarily theoretical model projections generated initially aiming seek out plausible real world scenarios potentially emerging arising contingencies arise forthwith incorporation preliminary findings corroborative insights gathered prior integration adjustment calibration refinement yield improved performance optimization tactics integrated comprehensive suite tools enhancement techniques alongside novel algorithms optimized design implementation strategies designed custom tailored suited particular applications address targetted requirements seeking meet set objectives align closely expectant delivery timelines specified contractual obligations stipulated amongst participants involved negotiations reached consensus agreement terms established legal framework agreed subsequent execution phase initiated pursuant completion milestone achievements track progress achieved identify potential challenges encountered mitigate risks managed effectively safeguarded project continuance securing ultimate deliverable successfully delivered according schedule committed fully met deadlines honor commitments made fulfill promises kept uphold integrity maintained professionalism exercised honesty demonstrated trustworthiness proven reliability",

But note that these parentheses aren't needed when writing mathematical expressions since multiplication symbol(*) comes right before other operands so don't feel constrained either way .
