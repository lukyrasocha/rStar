Therefore, Jillian\u2019s purse cost $220 based off our deductions made previously using algebraic functions. Finally express your findings in English stating explicitly the equation being used and explain why you use these specific terms throughout solving complex word problems like algebra; especially focus around terminologies related to 'difference', 'times,' and their relation within calculations. When dealing with linear equations derived from real world scenarios such as age or item pricing relationships, key phrases often denote mathematical operations necessary to solve them correctly. Words representing multiplication (\"three times\") indicate repeated addition\u2014one element indicates multiplying one entity quantity ('x') against another numerical value presenting frequency count thus translating into expression form $(3*a)$ signifies tripling variable `a`. Here `$20` refers directly to its designated financial unit \u2013 dollar(s).

As simplification involves reducing equations using basic mathematical rules such as division properties, here you can observe when multiplying something before taking away one part outright (dividing), reduces calculations required later (simplifying equation); finally concluding $(240 / 2) results onto dollar amount '$120'. Thus confirmation proves correctness due logical derivations without direct computation methodologies applied earlier whilst maintaining validity according specified conditions presented within question itself implicatively leading us towards veracity assertion thereby provoking conclusion 'the cost being posited indeed fulfills criterion imposed initially pertaining financial relationship interplay occurrences amongst commodities described thus elevated comprehension achieved upon meticulous examination undertaken amidst pursuit sought.'
