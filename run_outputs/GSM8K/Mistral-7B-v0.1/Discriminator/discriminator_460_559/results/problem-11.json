        " 30 = 300. Determine the fractional change over time. Two months ago, it was stated that one fifth (1/5) of all pencils written off as being broken or otherwise unavailable would occur; thus, calculate this reduction first using proportional reasoning relative to overall numbers before applying percentage calculation later if necessary. This means approximately [eval(300*1/5)=60]60 pencils became unusable during those eight weeks since roughly halfway through school term. Deduce what happened next based upon further textual hints provided afterwards which explain subsequent usage habits toward ownership & maintenance practices amongst peers within their specific learning environment leading up towards said period throughout calendar semesters etc..

Calculate one fifth or 1/5th off these figures using multiplication as you would when dealing fractional values i.e., multiply the amount initially present by whatever value represents its corresponding ratio(which here translates into dividing).

However if you interpret question differently suggesting possible second use phase occurs immediately post first stated consumption rate applying same ratio onto leftover quantity(which I believe isn't asked nor intended), proceed through normal process getting ((4/5*300)-((4/5)^2)*(4/5*300))/(4/5)=sqrt(frac{(Total PcL)(Remaining PC)}{UsedPC})\u224871 leaving approx=27*(sqr_root[TotalPCL / UsedPC]) ~~->~~ Approximately calculable expression based off conditions present throughout provided timeline assuming identical distribution pattern continuation albeit possibly not strictly adherence due lack clarity surrounding such behavior per scenario guidelines etc..
