Simplified equation would become 2x+ 1,900= 2,400 Solving this we get; 2x = 500 Dividing both sides by 2 results into; x=  250 Therefore, since there are only 2 units (the same brand or model). One unit costs half its original value. We can write our last expression as follows: Monitor Cost=$250/2 Which simplifies down using basic mathematic operations division so finally Equals:$125 ",

        " Find out how much Errol spent on the other items besides the printer. Subtracting the price of the computer ($1,100) and assuming both monitors cost the same (x), we get 2*x + (cost of printer). But since the printer costs \"$400 less\" as compared to the computer; it means, Price Of Printer= $1,100-$400=$700 . Thus replacing this into our equation above yields ,  2*(cost per Monitor)+$700= $2,400 subtracting $700 brings us down to   2(monitor_price)=$1,700 Divide through by '2' :   Cost Per Monitor=($1,700)/2=>CostPerMonitor=$850 so finally, One Monitor Costs $850 when rounded off because every item listed here could only happen if values happened wholely according to real life scenarios meaning their unitary quantities need not breakdown further like cents or fractions hence why roundoff was applied during computing solution therefore providing most accurate estimates yet maintainable simplicity thereby keeping context & purpose clear without overcomplicatiion affecting basic readability resulting preferred practicality ensuring effective communication understanding whilst still deliverables precisely aligned against expected goals effectively meeting stakeholder expectations exactly thus creating trustworthiness reputation uphold credibility integrity ultimately fulfilling key strategic objectives successfully accomplishment critical success elements leading progress achievements optimal performance enhancement essential competitive advantage securing favorable position marketplace gain long term sustainable advantages driving superior results profitably maximizing bottomline potential elevated financial growth prospectivity capital appreciation opportunities unlock greater shareholders value wealth creation possibilities increasing enterprise valuation worth attractive merger/ acquisition attention raising investors interest engaging lucrative venture fundraising support catalyst innovating industry disruption revolution spark new product ideas revenue generating services products expand markets open access increase consumer choices variety diverse offerings enabling agile adaptation responsive evolution adapt technology integrate emerging technologies scale operations optimise efficiency leverage synergies collaborate partnerships achieve economies of scope achieving operational excellence minimize waste reduce overhead costs eliminate redundancies streamline processes automate procedures improve quality control heighten customer satisfaction ensure compliance regulations meet safety standards optimize resource allocation manage inventory levels efficiently utilize supplies",
        " the printer costs $400 less than the computer which was priced at $1,100; thus, the printer would come out to be valued at ($1,100-$400) or $700. This means that together, these three devices (computer+monitor\u00d72+(Printer))cost $(1100+$700), hence making them worth about($1800). Subtract this value from our original sum(i.e.,$2,400-$1800)$ to find what both monitors combined equate to,(this makes it easier as we can divide easily),(which turns out to equal,$600$), meaning if you subtract again half way because there\u2019s only two of those(herein referred to as \u201cthe second time\u201d)(therefore being twice times overhalf equals fulltime);that brings us into conclusion stating that individually a single device/machine i.e.(one monitor )would not surpass up to approximately$(300)$. Therefore ergo putting forward that exactly every individual \u2018doughnut machine\u2019=or=(single unit)= approx.(approx.) $$$$$$$$300$. Consequently presenting ourselves finally herewithly announcing:(exact dollar amount=$300$) ",
        " cost of the printer was $1,100 - $400 = $700. Subtract these known values from the overall amount spent to find out what combined costs represent (the value needed). That would leave us $(2,400 - ($1,100 + $700)) =$600 representing the summed cost of both monitors. Since we know this total represents 2 identical priced objects (monitors), you can divide it further into its individual prices i.e., $\\frac{$600}{2}$ which equates to $300 per item or monitor. Thus, One monitor costs $300. ",
