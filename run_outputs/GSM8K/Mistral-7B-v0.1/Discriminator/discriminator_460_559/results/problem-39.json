First method involves simple algebra -- multiply out terms until reaching equality points where either variables cancel through addition/subtraction leaving constants solved immediately ,or substitution replaces another variable value based only using previous defined relationships discovered within problem itself rather than general formula application used below under third option above ... Second approach works best when comparing numerical quantities against various functions describing behavior patterns displayed throughout question posited ; often called graphical visualization since numbers themselves represent rates changing constantly according rules established initially but still ultimately comparable versus constant amounts found while analyzing situation carefully before determining desired outcome... Thus ensures consistency across multiple scenarios encountered regularly whenever facing similar decision making processes requiring logical reasoning combined effectively applied math skills needed simultaneously perform correct analyses correctly conclude optimum choice among available options presented without missing any vital piece essential understanding gained during solving particular task ahead successfully.... Third route employs differential calculus techniques assuming familiarity level sufficient covering derivatives alongside implicit differentiations useful especially considering specific real life applications dealing large data sets containing complex relations interdependencies involving countless factors influencing individual decisions impact significant consequences entail affective aspects alter behaviors accordingly necessitating adaptability incorporation appropriate strategies utilized tackling diverse range situations encounters daily lives experience growing needs comprehension advanced analytical capabilities demand efficient resolution practical effectiveness maintain high performance achievements goals align expectations reality fulfill requirements demands modern environment fast paced technological advancements competitive global economy evolving business markets continuously innovative societal developments accelerated pace change challenges traditional boundaries breakthrough discover new paradigm shift emerge ground",

Accordingly, equation can look like this =>  200=25*X+5*X=> Equivalent Cost; or =>   200=(25+5)*X .Solving it further we get X=$8 , hence if less than eight people come only Venue one would save him money. Therefore when exactly having ten fourteen sixteen persons present neither place becomes cheaper compared to another.. ",
        ", so overall costs would be ($200+$5x) as 'X'-number of persons (assume people coming over including spouse). And also we know according to condition 2, booking charge or other extra fees like tax etc., was free! Also remember you don't need to worry about profit here. Bookings both places equate if $(200+5*X)=$25*X$. It means cookbook/caterers get same amount when ((5*$spouse)+(additional X)*$)per ppl=($X_*)$Perguests i.e.-((5 * Spousescost )+(Total Cost \u2013 Flat Feet)))=$Bills/$Charged Per Person-$Booked Place Charges.=SpousesCost-(Flat Fee\u2013Guest Charge))which becomes $$=(5*(No_of Guests)),$(",

Calculate additional variable cost associated with using third option due to it lacking inclusivity. As noted above, we can subtract off the expected $5 average direct spending ($/guest) relating solely to personal expenditures when considering just what would otherwise contribute toward making comparison equitable vis-a-vis both other options within context described here; hence such factors ought generally excluded while establishing comparative grounds among choices presented via query subject matter provided earlier referenced specifically throughout text surrounding main inquiry itself pursuant further assessment undertaken subsequent review processes thus applied accordingly commencing shortly following initiation dialog exchange thereby engaging participants involved immediately prior through entirety course sequence upon completion succeedance subsequently initiated thereto prompt forthwith ensuing interactions embodied initially manifested concomitantly executed concurrently synchronized collectively performed comprehensibly altogether seamlessly systematically simultaneously unmistakably unequivocally entirely holistic interdependently progressive wholly collaboratively cumulatively continuously coherent consistently concordantly cooperatively coordinatively harmoniously synergistically symbiotically solidarity uniformly wholeheartedly intimately thoroughly extensively mutually effectively reciprocally beneficial advantageously profitableness auspiciously gratifying favorable convenient accommodating pleasantly agreeably amicably amiability benevolence charity magnanimous generosity kindly warmth friendliness hospitable convivial cordial fellowship neighborliness benign softness gentility decorum good breeding propriety decency modesty courtesy civility refinement politeness dignity etiquette elegance manners gracious behavior humbleness submission service excellence quality clean pleasant neat tidy orderliness organization meticulous precision accuracy careful thorough exact detail attention scrupulous minutely minute particular special specific detailed especially extraordinary unusual marvel wonderful amazement wonder fine lovely nice very dear admirable magnificent splendid beautiful gorgeous delightful pleasure joy happiness enjoy mentality attitude outlook mindset spirit disposition feeling emotional affect mood sentiment sensation state emotion experience moment occasion occurrence event circumstances case situation instance incident incidents happenings events meeting happening time period interval duration timespan span length phase cycle roundabout journey trip tour travel venture business visit invest",

By dividing both sides of the equation using algebraic steps($200 /$20= Number_of_Guests),we find out that No. of Guests needing to make up exactly halfway equals 10 since the question requires identifying when the parties would break even/become equally priced so henceforth no surplus nor shortfall arises .
