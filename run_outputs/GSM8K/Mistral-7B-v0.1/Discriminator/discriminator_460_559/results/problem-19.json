        "*0.2= 300. Since this amount increases when booking hotels during a holiday or vacation period, adding these increased amounts makes the daily rate equal (in other words) 1500+300=$1800 . Multiply those values again over three days equals (1800)*(3)= 5400. Adding together what was previously calculated adds up to all expenses (ticket prices plus accommodations). Therefore tom paid $(5000)(2)+$5400=(10000+5400), which sums up as being $15400. Because Tom took only one flight though; therefore just pay attention to half of everything but doubled the third day\u2019s night stay rates... so calculate ($5000)/2+$($1800)$^2/2+(also take care not forgetting about Wednesdays midnight shift): ($5000)/2+($(1800)-((7200)/2))+(($1800)))/(midnight work hour change adjustment effect)^2,$$. It means that $$5000/2+{eq}(1500\\cdot \\text{(1 minus }}(\\frac{\\pi}{1}\\sqrt{\\frac{x^a}{(y+z)\\gamma}}-\\log C){/eq)} {$$} becomes ${}$ (2500+\\log (\\frac{-e^{-1}+C}{\\frac{(-3)^{1/3}+\\left ( {\\tfrac{\\pi }{2}}\\right )^{1 / 2}}{6}}) ). To obtain integer part numbers you need approximately $-0.02$, yielding exactly  5050....So I conclude our summed result comes downto around 5k if your goal value doesn't involve logarithmic terms!...as well as saying that although mathematically accurate, my attempt might benefit greatly from numerical evaluation techniques such as integration calculus methods rather than raw symbolic manipulation due to large range discrepancies..

And ticket prices multiply together since both Tom & Wife needing one so that makes them spend $10,000$ additionaul totalling all their travel related bills comes out , $5400 + $10,000=$15400$.
