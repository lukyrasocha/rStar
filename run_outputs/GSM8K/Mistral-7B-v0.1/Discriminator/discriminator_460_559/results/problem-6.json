That means she effectively pays $(9 \u2013 ($1/$20)) which equals $(9-$0.05) or $8.95 per apple costing them collectively (before including taxes/fees), as every tenth cent saved contributes significantly over multiple purchases. Each Apple was sold for forty-five hundredths; thus eight point ninety-five times twenty sums up their costs respectively totalling approximately  179. To solve this problem let us assume we only deal with whole numbers since our calculations would not yield anything else so you can simply round prices if need arises However I am unsure about your intention here Let me redo it slightly differently We know neither what exact price points nor weights used contribute towards determining these figures however assuming approximate values makes sense One approximation could involve taking into account possible losses due either spoilage, mishandling during packaging, transport etc... This brings down expected net gains when compared against actual expenditures Unfortunately without specifying such details my attempts may still prove futile It sounds like someone trying too hard Maybe consider calculating average weight rather Assuming all variables held constant except perhaps slight variations induced via different suppliers possibly causing minor differences As long as both parties buy exactly twice as many pounds minus whatever variation exists no one wins Here goes Example Suppose Supplier B charges S% cheaper But supplies W fewer pounds At best case scenario Buyer A buys Q amount X Y grams less resulting L lb reduction Percent Difference=(P_B*L\u2013Q)/(X+Y)=D Which equivocally describes percentage change Between Variation Varies Depending On Prices Available Anyhow My apologies once again Hopefully better understanding comes soon Thankyou Regards :) You\u2019re welcome!

        " question easily. Since she only gets such small changes back it\u2019ll just mean Kelly ends up getting about 9 cent less per apple (her original price), so this means when comparing who spent more you simply compare their undiscounted prices which was $1 before compared to hers being around 1 dollar also because our conversion factor here isn\u2019t going into billions or trillion numbers anytime soon). Therefore since both individuals purchased exactly 20 identical items under those conditions without counting anything else like shipping fees etc., Kelsea would technically spend precisely as much again despite obtaining cheaper rates due largely owning directly related amounts/quantities within similar proximity ranges across multiple factors besides mere transactional values alone \u2014 regardless however whether either party opts out completely toward excluding certain elements altogether thereby rendering irrelevant nearly all aspects otherwise unrelated towards pricing strategies employed regarding future procurement activities thus making them practically interchangeable unless perhaps requiring specific adjustments concerning preferred purchasing methods instead\u2026 But let us see what happens if we apply these differences fairly consistently throughout calculations involving buying behavior among other variables while maintain reasonable assumptions based upon common sense thinking approaches rather assuming complex equations rooted deeply inside mathematics itself!
