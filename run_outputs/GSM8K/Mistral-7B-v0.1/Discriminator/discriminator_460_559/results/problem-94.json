Therefore, on a warm day it would take him 16*3=48 minutes to swim three miles versus only taking half this time if the weather was colder so he saved himself 48/2-3(minutes). To simplify we can add these times together since finding the difference is asked here not multiplying them out but getting rid of like terms. We get back our result 24+3 or just simply subtracting the first term away leaving us with  24 mines less spent overall compared with what it took him under warmer conditions This makes sense because technically you want to reduce any sort of extra distance covered regardless o temperature outside whether its shorter distances covering something larger due to different temperatures allowing faster performance hence why i chose your latter method over mine .

We doubled this time to account for 'twice', resulting in approximately 4 minutes extra spent per mile because of warmer temperatures. Finally, since these additional expenditures apply consistently over every three miles, you would just need to triple them according to our initial equation which tells us he spends roughly 6 hours longer during those same distances if all other factors remained constant. Hence multiplying by .66 (a conversion factor representing half an increment plus another third due to tripling), yields about 3.96 minutes greater distance required within cooler conditions while keeping pace consistent enough so not requiring compensatory speed adjustment beyond its natural variance inherent through differing thermal states imposed onto human performance standards across sport disciplines like competitive swimming under varying environmental circumstances characterized primarily around aquatic temperature ranges typically associated respectively colder regions versus typical Mediterranean climates known hereinafter henceforth synonymous interchangeably although strictly speaking distinctly separate environments based largely upon regional geographic distribution patterns specifically focusing squarely upon European continent territorial boundaries).

Next remember slowdown due air resistance increase also reduces efficiency quite often leading people feeling slightly better moving fast compared lesser resistant medium such as oceans hence why most oceanists prefer shorter distances over others unless forced otherwise via gripping ropes which helps negate pressure loss somehow despite being heavier materials thus causing problems while restring oneself especially without assistance... Anyways back track ; ) Ok next thing noted down:- Every ten meters cost approximately twenty hours based upon previous trials during summer months(-hot)- However considering winter conditions (-cold), around forty percent improvement occurs using various techniques ranging anywherefrom fifty seven thousandths(.05x hundred thousands plus zero point thirty five (.035))% decrease respectively depending entirely on situation type&climate variations involved.; Hence comparing them side-to-side indicates overall effectiveness differs dramatically across different environments namely snowy areas near lakesides versus coastal regions experiencing cool breezes yet lack adequate infrastructure supporting efficient thermal regulation systems resulting primarily within frigid zones situated away form mainstream commercial centres having reduced accessiblity towards specialized equipment capable maintain optimal running conditions amidst extreme atmospheric variables.- Ultimately concluding outcome lies directly correlated mainly associated individual choices relating specifically personal preference among certain activities performed rather isolatedly solely governable mechanism exclusively restricted according limited technical capabilities obtainably available presently worldwide sans major technological breakthrough still awaited pending further research discoveries potentially transformative nature",
