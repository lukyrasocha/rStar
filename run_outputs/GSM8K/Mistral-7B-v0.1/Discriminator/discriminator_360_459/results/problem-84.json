Therefore if movie B was increased by this same difference it would become equal to film c\u2019s duration thus making both films last approx  4.92+5=9.92 hours i .e., roughly equivalent seconds spent watching them.(Since these numbers cannot exist because we already found out above what movies b &c actually Duration wich mean no such relation exists hence not possible.)

To effectively solve these types of problems, you need to pay careful attention to converting units when necessary\u2014such as changing hours to minutes if needed\u2014as well as using proportional relationships established through phrases such as 'one fourth', 'twice', etc., correctly throughout computations. Understanding that multiplying both sides of an equation can help isolate variables while maintaining equality further simplifies finding values involved indirectly mentioned rather explicitly stated ones; hence demonstrating mastery over dealing with algebraic expressions interspersed amongst ordinary arithmetic tasks provides considerable advantage towards tackling complex multi-variable equations across various subject areas beyond mathematics alone!

This matches up with our previous calculation which confirms our result; hence, we can conclude Movie A lasts for approximately 19 minutes rounded off to the nearest minute due to practical considerations. To summarize, Movies lengths were calculated based solely on provided information about their durations relative to other movies mentioned within this question, without relying external sources. Therefore, considering average speed perception among viewers might differ depending upon various factors like personal preferences etc., my estimation align closely but isn't exactly measured time conversion during movie playback under usual circumstances.
