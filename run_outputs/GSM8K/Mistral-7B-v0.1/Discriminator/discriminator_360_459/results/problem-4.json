Adding these gains makes it apparent likewise as such steps equate exactly opposite losses, which balance them thus making us zero movement overall since forward strides cancelled all previous slipback movements perfectly apartward/acrossway(if you want) even though sometimes referred to just using words instead numerical value representation herein could make things appear ambiguous hence clearer language ensures precision unambiguously!

Since finishing places cannot go below zero let alone negative values (-5 would actually mean still being upfront despite all setbacks because you\u2019re not overtaken.), we interpret '-5' here as moving into last place considering possible draws or shared times which might exist outside typical competition rules.
