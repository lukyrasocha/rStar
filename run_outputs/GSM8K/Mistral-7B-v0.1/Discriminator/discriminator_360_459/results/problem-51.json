Given as a percentage value means subtract its decimal form (.2) times our original purchase sum (=$1200).

To find out how much both packages together cost before the discount, add these amounts up: $400 (for the first package) plus $800 (for the second package), resulting in a subtotal of calc<<400+800>>$1200. Apply the 20% discount; this means reducing the overall price by 20%, or multiplying the original amount ($1200) by 20% expressed as decimal form (.2). Thus, multiply $1200 by .2 yielding a reduction value of $calc<<1200*.2>>$240. Subtract the reduced sum from the initial pre-discount spending figure to get post-discount expenditure: calculate $1200 minus $240 which results in total savings of $calc<<1200-240>>$960 saved due to the discount offer. Following this logic leads us back towards finding your asked quantity. This time though consider adding all items including the finishing piece.

Simplifying yields our new variable equation below:(for instance):$(+)((-)())()$. Lastly, add all other expenditures made beyond those initial ones together.(e.g., finisher sparkler).

        " or 2*400=800. Altogether these items would normally cost him  800+400=$1200 but since this purchase qualified as being over $1000 it received a 20% reduction (.20) which saved .2*($1200)=$240 bringing its price down to ($1200-$240)=$960.. This isn\u2019t quite correct because you forgot about the finale banger! Its priced separately and doesn't count towards getting any kind of bulk savings...so if we don't deduct anything yet regarding our first set (forgetting not factoring in the extra), I believe $(400+$800)+(150-($.2*$[400+$800+150])=. Adding back my own error, yes your method works though just remember when adding separate purchases together like yours example i meant; Total expenditures=(total initial amounts)$*(1-.k),(here k was equivalent to 'r'). Simplified,(Total amount spent)-((discount rate)(Original Amount Spent))....So,$$(400+(2\\times400)+150)-\\color{",

His savings amount totals ($1200)*.2=($<<1200*.2=240>>). Therefore , when you subtract your deductions this sums him down paying only $(1200-$240)= $<<1200-240=960>>960 altogether   Lastly note that adding herein isn\u2019t just limited since Tim spent nothing less than buyng even the grandiose last minute extra piecewise effect which comes as no extras but still bags its own bundle priced at(1) $150 To complete our calculations hence :     Cost without any discounts    $1200+totalcostoffinalefirework@endhere$       Subtracting all promos saves us ..
