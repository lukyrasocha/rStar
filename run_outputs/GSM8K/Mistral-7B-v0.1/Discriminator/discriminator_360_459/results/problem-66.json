Since these statistics indicate exactly what happened here; therefore sales revenues come increasingly downwards even if prices remain unchanged throughout periods leading eventually becoming negative again afterwards until either companies start producing less stuff anyway sometimes causing massive layoffs right alongside significant job losses thereby reducing available spending power amongst remaining individuals too furthermore potentially triggering rises employment rates indirectly whilst stimulating economic growth simultaneously helping businesses stay afloat amid declining returns via higher expenses related welfare programs providing social security benefits etcetera along side government tax breaks provided free medication health insurance plans making everyone happy forever whenever possible!!

This aligns closest among options provided which makes option `E` , representing `.$6.` correct here even though actual calculation leads us closer towards \"$6\". Although this might seem confusing considering numerical approximation isn't usually used while calculating expenses precisely but sometimes due to wording contextual choices like 'some', approximate calculations become valid within text interpretation scenarios hence going with E seems best fit over others when strictly interpreting question without assuming any strict mathematical error tolerance zone yet accepting less precise interpretations based purely on information available leading directly & intuitively into such choice.
