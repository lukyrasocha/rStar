Adding a device consuming 2 kilowatt hours a day increases this amount by (2 kg/hour)*($1.50/kg*h)*7 days=$21 extra over the course of the week making the whole cost rise upto$126+$21=147.$Now if we want to know the difference it means subtracting former value(before using the additional appliance). Hence,$147-$126=-$21.So the correct option here would be $-21$.This indicates minus twenty one dollar as our resultant figure which represents decrease in monthly expenditure when compared against previous figures.(negative signifies reduction or lessening.)In layman terms,It essentially implies saving about $21 in comparison towards regular bills because the usage rate dropped down due to newly employed strategy thereby leading toward economic outlook improvement through energy conservation methodology utilization while spending not exceeding prior allocation plans despite simultaneous enhancement operations undertaking execution process.

Since all numbers need common denominator multiply those last equations together accordingly..here you could divide either side of any equality by their greatest factor while keeping values identical ..the lowest value would represent your solution here since both sides cancel out without affecting balance...for instance if our problem said:\"what percentage drop occurs?\" We wouldn\u2019t want too small fraction thus eliminating use least divisible multiple like above example only having factors present already rather working backwards dividing until whole integer appeared). This approach works because regardless whether its positive increase case needs division up top vs smaller decrease scenario no changes occur making finding min value easier)..Note also neither formula requires special rules nor adjustment methods just straightforward calculation applying proper signs alongwith converting units correctly first prior performing actual work otherwise results incorrect!!! Also notice these forms allow substitution method similar applied earlier except substituting terms containing unknown quantity instead specific ones being calculated directly but still yield same outcome provided enough information exists throughout entire set leading towards ultimate determination\u2026 Another interesting fact regarding formulas include utilizing variables within them versus relying strictly upon fixed numerical representation allows flexibility allowing us see underlying patterns emerge easily enabling future expansion etc!
