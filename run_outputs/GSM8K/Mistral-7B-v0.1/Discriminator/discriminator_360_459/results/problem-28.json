        " delivered 66 messages to Ms. Thompson. Next, determine what fraction of this amount was used when addressing Mr. Yu\u2019s classes; it says 'one third', so we divide the quantity (66) associated with Ms. Thompson into three equal parts which equals approximately 22 (`66 / 3`) This suggests that around `22` messages went to every one out of those three parts correspondingly assigned teachers or rooms i.e., both being part of separate groups since no common denominator group exists among them but still related through delivery order. Thus multiplying these values results only yieldings single summation due lack any unified reference thus having relevance separately addressed context within said framework therefore resulting cumulation totals accordingly becomes synonymously reflected merely representing individual summed contributions contributing exclusively towards their own designated recipients thereby excluding aggregate inclusion hence ultimately arrives consolidated figure expressed solely embracing collective contribution inclusions whilst omitting potential aggregative elements otherwise potentially implied errant interpretation assumptions surrounding notion generalization extending possibly beyond original intention stipulations specified specifically confined scope parameters ensuring absolute adherence integrity comprehensive understanding clarifying discourse explicitly precluding possible ambiguous inference interpretations hitherto neglectibly overlooked consequentially mitigatory effectuality maintaining precision fidelitiously respectfully upholding established premise normatively obliging procedural rigor assiduously fostering transparency coherently facilitating lucid articulation unequivocally eliminatably disambiguating ostensible lexical vagueness efficaciously decisively definitively categorically concisely conclusively expeditiously efficiently systematically strategically purposefulness constructively creatively innovatively ingeniously pragmatically prudentially meticulously scientifically rationalistically practically technologically methodically empirically experimentally objectively validantly impartially equitably ethically universally fairly holistically humanely compassionately empathetically sensitively perceptively insightfully intuitively reflectively introspectively intelligently wisely judiciously critically logically conceptually theoretically hypothetically analogically synthetically abstractedly figuratively literarily allegorically poetically philosophically existentially axiomatically postulate propositionally deductionally inferentially speculatively tentatively cautiously conservatively progressively gradually incrementally linearly sequentially simultaneously diversely concurrently",

        " to Mr.Yu which equals (1/3)*(66) =  22 messages if you multiply both numerator and denominator it becomes simpler calculation (6*1)/(3*6)= 2 messages. Add these numbers together to find out all the messages carried out by Jame throughout this scenario; therefore add 66+2=88 messages. Final ",
        " delivered to Ms. Thompson (66) by 3 since it says he delivered 'one third'. Doing so results in him delivering 22 messages to Mr. Yu because 66 / 3 equals 22 messages. Adding these values together (for both teachers combined), you get your solution which would be obtained by adding the value found above(Mr.Yu\u2019s received message count). Therefore, summarizing them up; summing up the individual numbers provided yields ((Ms.Thompson's receipt)+(Mr.Yu's receiver)) i.e., 66+22=88 messages therefore the correct option here outlines exactly what needs to happen based on those actions stated prior within question prompt when translated into mathematical notation form hence our selection . Thus concluding statement b ) Total Messages Deliveried By James Is 88 As per Calculation Formulated Earlier!

        " James delivers to Ms. Thompson (66) times one third (= / 3). This calculation equals 22 when divided or multiplied since multiplication undoes division; therefore, these calculations equal the same result. Add up all three numbers \u2014\u00a0the message count James sent out during work time\u2014and find their sum which includes four values because it represents both individual counts plus the combined value calculated above together adding them yields sixteen eighteen twenty eight thirty eight fifty forty totaled twelve hundred twentytwo seventyone sixtyfour ninetythree eleven seventeen zeropointzero minus ten point seven fifteen equalling eleventeight dozen overlook!
