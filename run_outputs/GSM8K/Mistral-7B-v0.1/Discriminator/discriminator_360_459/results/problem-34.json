        " 'double plus twenty.' Calculate this quantity first since it depends directly upon the multiplication factor (number of rows times number of columns). Double means multiplying something by itself or twice ('times'), which would amount to `rows`*'`columns'. Twenty addition can just follow afterwards as indicated by `'plus`' . This process equates into `(rows * columns) * 2 + 20`. Substitute actual numbers provided; therefore our equation becomes `(6 * 6)*2+20`, calculating accordingly equals seventy eight (`=(6*6)*2+20`). Therefore, seven hundred eighteen (\"718\") fits within option six (\"6\"). Henceforth we conclude Wendy requires sixty four thousand one hundred fifty two items/books(\"64152\"), but considering integer quantities only without fractional parts('zero point zero ...), rounding upwards wouldn\u2019t apply here because all calculations resulted whole integers already , hence no necessity towards such approach nor choice interpretation pertaining decimals.

Calculate double this dimension first because Wendy needs twice that amount plus twenty additional ones; therefore, multiply these together (double meaning times two): \\( 6 \\times 6 = 36 \\) [This represents the volume]. Doubling this value yields: \\( 36 \\times 2 = 72 \\), adding ten extra items brings us up to seventy-two (\\( 72 + 20 = 92 )\\). This indicates that without actually performing any further calculations, no matter what other conditions may influence your interpretation like whether considering only individual spaces within said structure etc., simply doubling leads straight onto calculating necessary totals when combining quantities linearly before adjusting\u2014a methodical approach suitable even though complexities could vary vastly under different interpretations involving geometric properties pertaining specifically towards spatial allocation regarding storage/shelf orientation relative distances spanning multiple levels along axes alignments implied thereby constraining potential options available while still adhering strictly conformity standards governing physical space optimization.)
