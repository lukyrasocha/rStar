This little exercise helps remind people who live off investments not ignore simple math but rather double check their calculations regularly against reality....It turns up quite nicely though ;) !:-) To summarize below follows my assumptions behind these numbers; Firstly everything needs space within itself whether its raw material inputs going towards production lines etcetera \u2013 such storage requirements create overhead expenses thereby reducing margins even further despite lower prices offered under competitive market conditions . Second point although consumers demand good products , ultimately cheaper ones tend earn larger volumes thus offsetting initial higher capitalized goods ; Third most efficient companies usually charge premium rates however lose less business because quality speaks loudest especially amongst niche markets aiming better returns upon individual purchases whilst saving funds overall due thanks too increased customer satisfaction ratings ). fourth reason why certain brands often succeed commercially lies hidden deep down right inside them : passion driving innovation coupled effectively alongside excellent service delivery results into sustained growth long term success stories unmatchable elsewhere throughout history .... Lastly remember always keep track record honest otherwise nobody appreciates honesty anyway .. Best wishes ???? ",

This basically says whenever anyone comes into shop looking interested yet ends up walking away unfulfilled due solely unto themselves being irrational rather than actually having needs satisfying circumstances present prior arriving\u2014therefore such scenarios shouldn't factor heavily either considering fact alone matters here regardless whether customers leave happy versus unhappy :D . Therefore let us assume best case scenario , no losses happened just revenue stream flow continues steady according expectations throughout entirety until completely exhausted supply thus resulting net income gained finally upon completion would equal initially calculated figure presented above minus actual expenses directly attributed specifically involving direct labor costs(which includes wages employee receives working plus indirect overheads payable etc.) Finally remember though even worse result occurs nobody ever really knows why sometimes good intentions fail despite seemingly obvious reasons leading down road less traveled.....so keep optimism high !!!

To calculate the revenue/hour rate based only upon this information we can assume millie makes it up within just 3 full batches if sold out which means making around ($18 / 3) = $6 per hour provided these sales rates stay consistent throughout operating hours without additional expenses related to longer operations like labour etc.. But since no specific info about duration was mentioned explicitly let us consider possible scenarios instead here are few examples : Say milli runs stall daily till sunset taking 4 hrs but lets forget cost factor during operation times thus assuming same ratio across various timelines ..so ,(total Profit$ divided By Hours worked)=Profit Rate/$ Hence either way ultimately depending specifically when exactly u need calculation .Example I could take scenario above into account wih assumptions made resulting =>($18dividedByHourlyrate=profitPerHour)$=>(hrlyRate=$9$).

As every customer pays one dollar but makes zero initial expense because you consider only actual cost without taking taxes into account , this means its very profitable as long as customers accept your price . Since milli runs out quickly(its sold), we can ignore buying new stuff due high demand & short time frame involved. However considering scenario might affect future business when market conditions change like less hours available etc! Still looking ahead lets see what happens next\u2026 First up let\u2019s find max amount revenue achieved within specified period before breaking even : That occurs once supply reaches twice daily limit since sales happen faster than refill rate i reckon could bring back double income earned previously plus overheads minus any unexpected losses during peak times such weather disruptions caused reduced foot traffic ; hopefully returns near equivalent values thus making investments worthwhile yet still allowing small operational margins unlike competitors doing better jobs..

With Millie being able sell individual portions or 'glasses', pricing them simply off said initial investment would yield roughly .6c(cost per portion)(x gross income). While having set prices might actually cause consumers willingness to pay above what people normally charge just based solely on fair trade concerns about production costs alone may also contribute towards increasing profits if possible when compared against normal market conditions outside extreme inflation scenarios like during world wars etc..

Calculate revenues generated throughout sales if everything sold goes through successfully without shortages being encountered along the way when demand hits zero supply availability status.
