To find what amount it costs while getting reduced by the mentioned percentage we use $(total)*(.8), this means you multiply .8 times itself however many time equals 20%, or every second term once (.8^x=.2). Using a calculator, finding when $.8 raised to X equals 0.2 reveals around 2 terms being required; rounding appropriately leaves us multiplying only twice instead of threefold due its less than desired value. Thus performing our calculation yields: ($165*.8)*(.8)=$132-$26=$106 ",
