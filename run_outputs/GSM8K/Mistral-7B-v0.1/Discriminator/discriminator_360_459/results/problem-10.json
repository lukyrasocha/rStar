But since no locations specific here let us just take into account minimum amount saved overall (i) say its half way up thus reducing material costs meaning ($1/$2)=$.

Also need mention here few points :- Cost reduction occurs either through elimination / substitution etc., whereas marginal pricing remains unchanged; prices rise under demand inflationary impact thereby increasing overall expenditure involved too .. All these details together indicate reason behind why such things tend happening especially business wise even though consumers don\u2019t mind spending extra cash sometimes .
