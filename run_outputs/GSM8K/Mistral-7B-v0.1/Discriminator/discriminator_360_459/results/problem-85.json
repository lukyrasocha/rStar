Finally calculate if Michael can afford such food based off of what money he possess according to question; as mentioned 'he possessessix 5 dollar bills', thus(total_money)=($5)*6=$30 since these values don\u2019t match up here meaning that he actually CANT buy all the needed Hay!

To determine if he would receive any sort of change when subtracting $12 (the amount paid) from $300 (initially possessed funds), perform subtraction operation as follows; i.e., calculate initial quantity minus expenditure made during shopping spree thus determining your surplus cash remaining post transaction completion.

        " this means the horses eat  960 / 2= <<960/2=480>>480 halves of hay or half as many full bails!

Having spent sixty four score USD running around town all afternoon keeping pace, Michael hands over forty five units(cents)-a crisp twenty quarter set-$fifteen when purchasing hay foodstuff for Flurry--the only living being who shows appreciation towards anyone within ear shot.(Fifty percent discount plus reward points!) Thus ,after receiving reimbursement Michael walks away having fifty U.S. Dollars remaining $(28+15 = 43)$. His original cache was twelvefold greater because seven quarters equal thirtythree silver coins which translate into Fortune($7x3=$ 21)+five additional cents ($[5+(21)]=[$]26$)!!!!! All together...his net gain comes down to seventeen united states currency notes!(Ten pounds ten shillings equals Seventeen United States One Hundred Twenty Pound Silver Coins)!

Hence no realistic calculation could lead him into positive or negative currency balance since initial budget falls far short than expenses required fulfillment during this scenario setting.

This choice implies just over fifty millions i.e thirty quarters plus seventeen twenties totalling towards almost eighty minus twenty equals roughly approximately thrice tens hence concluding our solution through deduction rather than multiplication namely division into halves repeatedly until such time yields minimalistic units whose sum approximates unto desired numerals precisely calculated beforehand thereby presenting definitive summation indeed!

Because you need three quarters amount ($0.75), we could consider just one quarter price unit($0.25). With this approach let\u2019s divide required funds in multiples of four:   $\\frac{240}{0.25} = 960 \\text{units}$. That is exactly what Micha can buy right away considering its value as $$(960*$0.25)= $240$. But remember Mike spent all those $. Since only whole numbers accepted when counting currency, since such fractions really mean something, lets find lowest denominator possible while preserving accuracy , thus multiply resulting expression $(240/$ .25 )= $960$, noticeably less than previously mentioned figure due to fractional conversion error!
