        " number of silver pesos Annakid (Anna)has; this requires you use information about Anka first since it says \u2018Twice\u2019 which means double so multiply Alexa's amount by 2. That implies annakid or Anna has ,double axel's sum(silverpeso)*which amounts to=50*2==$**So annakid or Anna also holds $$$. To get both their golden pesa values add them up:annakaoranna--->ananas+axen+=goldpesodollarsand thus combining both results we find out that---$$&+++$&=totalresult=(dollaramountofannaprice)+(${dollaramountofashprice). This simplifies into :TotalPesomoney=$[((()*$[]+(({}[](@)(%))))]+[(())] Therefore putting actual numbers would mean Total Peso Amount=[(50*2)+(80)]-(because 'twicedarkeras',$(),${} represent doubling & addition respectively)=[(100)+(80)-].

        " know this because it says 'twice as many', hence 2*50= 100 Silver pesos (Anna). Since axel possesses less than half or quarter(which means around)the amount of all the other persons combined which makes sense since both their amounts fall below those values too.. Calculate Anna\u2019s golds using information about hers being greater compared others'. With us having fewer numbesr so we find out Anna only holds slightly over what would make up half/quarter when taken collectively wich implies Ana owns something like : (a+b)/2 >c , where c represents our shared quantity ie sum_of(axel[silver]+anasilver)+sum_(axelgold+anasegold), thus deduced value shall not exceed . Find totals individually first before finding cumulative numbers:- Total of Anana&AxeSilvers:Sum((50)*2,(100))-> Sum=(100+100)=Total:(200)- Totals Of Golds Only Together::Sum(((80)), ((BrandNewGold)))-->Tot=(80+(Brandnew Gold))-->(Since none here mentions new gold figures but rather shares above average ones among friends)-> This can imply no extra wealth brought along either due to poor planning; if any such thing was mentioned could perhaps mean someone missed paying debt settlement altogether!
