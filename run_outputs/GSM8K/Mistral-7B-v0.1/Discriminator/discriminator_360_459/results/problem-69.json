The numbers twelve represents three tens ones or twenty six but since it says 'their words',it means summed result not product ,so subtract ten instead adds hundred so forty minus seventy would leave us negative Thirty Three if this question was referring products I could understand what you mean however as word sums my thought process here takes me down another path please help clarify.\r\rMy initial intuition about combining those values wasn\u2019t quite right\u2026 because \u201cTwenty\u201d & \u201dSeven\u201d equal Twelve...
