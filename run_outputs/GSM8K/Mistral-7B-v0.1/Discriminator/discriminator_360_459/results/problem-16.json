Therefore divide this figure (of non-Blue supporters i.e., 30), into four equal portions to know what constitutes one such portion size; using simple division indicates any individual segment comes around about six--and thus when you multiply it back twice because just ONE fourth group still remains outside Green preference circle---which yields approximately twenty numbers indicating people favor Yellow hue!

Nextly divide them equally into four parts as their choice represents equal portions: Numbers favoring Green & Yellow respectively = Preference / Portion= 20\u2797\u00bd(a quartet)= 10 . As such it leads us to conclude that ten kids enjoy green hue while another set of children lean towards being enamored by yellows i.e., zero pupils choose yellow among the listed colors options because all choices including greens consummated prior selection process leaving none interested in selecting other available option.

To obtain the remainder fondly inclined towards another specific hue we need only figure out what fraction equates to four parts out of seven since three parts remain undetermined thus far while splitting ten into eight segments results in seventeen fifths , sixteenth remains ; divide resulting portion according to established proportion i.e., multiply it via ratio hence getting eighteen divided thrice yield twelve partying lovers drawn toward Yellow ..
