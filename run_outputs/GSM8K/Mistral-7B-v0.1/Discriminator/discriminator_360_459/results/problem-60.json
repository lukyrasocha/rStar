        " received from the other party. We know this was 'twice', meaning doubled. To find out what it equals we can either multiply or divide (since doubling something means multiplying/division). Since knowing division might require extra steps since you only need multiplication here; therefore dividing both sides using numbers which would make sense when solving equations helps understand better hence let us focus our attention onto identifying equivalent figures instead until finding answers later on without involving complicated mathematical terminology like logarithms & exponents etc.. Simply put if one wants three times X=Y , but Y already known via subtraction subtracting thrice whatever remains adds back into resulting sum adding up another third portion equal parts thus forming whole new quantities being tripled against base measurements .

When you calculate these numbers together (($4000+($4000*2))), it totals up to $12000 worth contributions received. Subtracting initial funds $(5000) from new cash influxes or additions $(12000), leaves us with Mr. Jose\u2019s current overall resources $$(5000+$12000)$$.

The answer is: 17000. Please note however without information about any potential profit losses due to business operations etc; its hard to determine actual 'Capital.'
