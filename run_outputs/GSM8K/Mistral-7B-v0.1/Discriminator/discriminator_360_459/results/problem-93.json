        " Jenna traded away three sapphires which is 3 x 100 = 300 dollars worth. Since we don\u2019t know if these new Ruby stones add any value or just replace them, let us say their initial combined monetary (their 'zero') equivalent was also \\$300 before buying them because nothing changed per se as far as financial impact goes. We can calculate only what changes during this transaction; thus focusing solely on those parts of cash flow affected directly by it like when you remove your existing stuff (\\$300).

However since Ruby comes cheaper than expected because you trade your sapphires into this kinda transaction; You get these other things for lesser price while maintaining relative exchange rate.. One such example could include currency rates/exchange fees etc...

Therefore our calculation changes slightly based upon new information obtained regarding potential groupings combined into singular transactions vs mere individual valuation units remaining separated apart without bundling components otherwise included hereunder stated requirements mentioned earlier under question section 'What factors influence pricing strategies?'
