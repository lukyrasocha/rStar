Given this information, you calculate the amount of full sets possible as follows : Total Egg Quantity / Number Per Tray = Possible Full Sets i.e.,  50/25 . This calculation results into just one complete set since we only want whole numbers when speaking about physical objects such as plates or jars here it would represent tables. Therefore **the correct answer**is `A`. To increase complexity slightly while ensuring relevance but not overcomplicating things further than necessary let me try rewording your initial task along these lines",

Therefore, rozanne could fill up (the ceilings) floor function(no decimals allowed)=floor_function((number)/quantity per unit)(in this case): float_ceil[(total quantity needed)/amount used](if not using floors/ceiling just use int divide). That means it would result into: max integer less than or equal to [float dividing 50 by 25]=int[divide 50 by 25]=2 full trays because any partial usage isn\u2019t counted here as we only need whole numbers since you cannot half fill a physical object like a tray.
