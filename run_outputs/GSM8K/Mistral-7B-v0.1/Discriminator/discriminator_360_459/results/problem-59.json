From here, compare this result against the location mentioned as Stanley\u2019s current position which indicates a place above sea level not relevant since we need only height difference. Since oliver starts off already established to be higher due to him situated at  3,000 ft., so all one needs to know would just pertain to the amount needed to bridge over distance i.e.; subtract initial point from conclusion point =>(6,000-(3,000)) = 3,000ft .

Given this assumption and considering typical scenarios involving mountains (\"a mountaintop\" implies we may consider points significantly higher than average ground levels), I am making the conservative estimation that since Stanly dropped the comb approximately halfway down based on height difference alone as mentioned\u2014it could potentially stay within such ranges like just under or around about another 2000 feet lower if not entirely beyond surface level. Determine Oliver's current position. We know Oliver currently stands at an elevation of 3,000 feet. Calculate the distance Oliver needs to travel upwards.

Find what would need to be subtracted from this result based upon Stanley\u2019s current location being referenced as above or underneath the original positioning.

This means hiking roughly around .5 * (total descent)= (.5)(7000), or about ,and slightly fewer than exactly : so Oliver only needs to go another thousand less.

As it turned out this wasn\u2019t correct because we never subtract or calculate anywhere near these figures; our task didn\u2019t involve any calculations related to height/elevations as per information available within question stem itself, only required reading them thoroughly once again. Therefore reassessing original statement\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201d**but if one considers both initial positions...\u201d,\u2009it becomes evident that what needs calculating isn\u2019t vertical displacement here \u2014 rather lateral movement\u202f\u2060\u200a\u00ad\u200a(from east\u00a0to west), since said scenario inherently demands such computation due its nature involving directionality combined alongside numerical values concerning horizontal ranges across topographic gradients expressed through specific measurable units viz., \u2019feet.\u2019 Hereafter present solution accordingly bearing mind conceptual amendment enacted above : OLSYP QUOTE INITIAL REMAINING VERTICAL DISTANCE TO UNITE BROTHER 'STANLEY.'

        " comb flew back upward because it landed near its starting position as well. That means adding another (6,000 / 2) = **3,000**. Total Feet Below Oscillations= Comb Fall Distance+Distance Travelled Upwards=(Comb drop height)+(Halfway point)= (Difference)(2)/2 . Convert this value into difference form ((DropHeight/ Difference)*((2))*TotalFallTime)-dropheight , we can see clearly here what I mean=.",
        " hiking upwards (i.e., going above sea level), starting at 3,000 ft; plus the extra height needed to get over 6,000 ft descent, equaling: 6,000ft+3,000feet=9,000. It means Oliver needs to hike further than him original position before dropping down into Stanley\u2019s new location.\r"
