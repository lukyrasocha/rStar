To create equivalent fractions while adhering to specific constraints such as using only integer values\u2014the numerator or denominator may not change but multiplying both parts simultaneously maintains their proportionality yet provides different representations of identical fractions known as 'equivalent fractions.' Here's the general strategy incorporated into your original inquiry involving mathematical expressions like `y=1/(kx^m)` or similar forms: Start off by identifying any common factors shared among numbers involved; simplification often facilitates generation of these relationships when working with algebraic terms.
