Cheese also requires one lb per four servings (or per sandwich), making it 5x$3 = $15 , or you can calculate as ($3*$20)/(1*4) because we need exactly 20 portions served even if this makes our calculation slightly easier than splitting into sets of groups serving upwards of half dozen). To find out how much Tyson spends on both meats together we simply add their totals; thus :$$35.00+$15.= $$50.00   We know from above these calculations only hold true under the assumption all purchased items retain their intended nutritional value throughout preparation time frames before consumption takes place ; additionality here refers strictly towards quantity procurement purposes alone without further consideration toward expense savings via bulk ordering methods such as volume discounts available when purchasing larger quantities over single orders made less frequently instead etc..
