As such we establish the required period as follows: Divide the mileage requirement before maintenance into their respective rounds up or down: floor(service_mileage / rounded) minutes until next stop. That yields around 18,000 / 375 ~= <<18000/375=48>>48 stops needed within regular use which equals approximately about 4 years if you consider all other factors remaining constant aside the mentioned ones .

This means that over the course of one complete cycle or trips around all four stations without stopping anywhere else along the way \u2014 which happens only once per day since we know nothing about additional stops throughout its route(for example due to traffic)\u2014we can calculate as follows : [(75/mile)+(100/mile)]*((1/(2))^n)*[(50/mil)=]to get [the average rate per mile]. Calculate these rates together . ((75 /miles )+(100 /miles))*(1/days)(since everything doubles if you double time). Divide both sides equally , resulting in [(75+(100*2))]/(time), thus getting ([175]+[200])=(475)/t=. Set up equation solving simultaneously using information above; divide through common factor:(bases divided across numerator equal bases multiplied out denominators),(total value divides evenly into itself yielding no remainder ).
