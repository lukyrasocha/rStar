Thus our initial assumption about Pop corn being $1 seems wrong; recalculate based upon original question details \u2013 when not using special package but individual items purchased separately under normal conditions. We understand thus Super Ticket pricing involves purchasing all included movies & snacks together cheaper. Ordinary Cinema experience requires buying tickets alongwith separate refreshments(either individually chosen ones like specific flavor/brand etc.) Hence comparing this scenario lets us infer normally cinema offers different sets including both single /multiple entry options depending on visitor preferences.(if so)$((Total spent - Saved)*2)=Movie Cost*5$ Solving numerically,$ Total Spent($)-$ Save(\\$) )\\*2$ $\\Rightarrow \\quad$$ ((23 -\\$2)/2)\\times5 =\\ \\$55$.

        " combined cost of one popcorn and a soda would otherwise exceed $1 plus your savings ($2), since buying individual items without discount still seems cheaper than using the special offer. Therefore, let P represent the price of popcorn alone; so we know S (price of soda) equals $3 as mentioned before. Since buying separate but no saving results into being exactly higher than just adding 1+P+(extra)+(cost of another popcorn or something equivalent which could not possibly be less expensive due to lacking bulk pricing advantages), it implies (separate tickets)=$2*($1+P+$3). Solving this leads us directly towards finding out what was already clear \u2013 even though separatly payments seemingly add way over $1 per item when subtracting those same prices back onto themselves once again leaves $(1\u00d72)$ unexplained amount equalizing them all together while maintaining both sides equalling true value hence indicating additional unwanted non-informative expense element here i.e., excessive packaging etc..

        " step by step. You saved $2 when not buying the super ticket so normally it would cost 2*20=$40 without savings. Since we know your total spending was just below this amount because of what else happened (popcorn and coffee), let us calculate exactly how far above $40 spenditure occurred. This means spent altogether something like$X+3+(regular_price)*(number of movies) = X \\approx \\$40$. But since every single customer comes alone ($C=1$), our equation simplifies down into:$($\\text{spent}$)+3+\\$(regular price)\\*$1=\\$\\$(theoretical max spending)$$,thus$$\\$X+3+\\$1*\\$(no.movies)=\\$40.$$Now lets consider another case which shows exact result: Say all customers decide to save everything aside as usual but instead want $\\$Y-$off cinemas; thus their theoretical maximum expenditure drops off again becoming $$\\$Y-\\$X-3-(regular\\_price)*1=\\$(\\$Y-\\$Z_{max})$$where Z represents original maximal daily budget based purely upon discountable items themselves $(regardless \\,of\\, C)$. Thus finally $$y=(x-z)$$gives out value being strictly positive yet less than full zero valued scenario hence concluding actual average cinema prices per individual come somewhere between both extremes depending mostlyupon personal preference plus availability factors including special occasions perhaps combined amongst other things also worth mentioning here...

        " by step. Without buying the super ticket we spent $25 ($12 tickets cost plus coffee+popcorn) but saved $2 so it was actually worth as little or less than what we paid (we assume this).

This means it would usually cost $2 less than buying individual items without savings ($2), so typically, separate cinema tickets plus snacks together would equal $22 (since we already know coffee alone accounts as $3). But because no discount applies here like 'buy whole combo,' hence add back this dollar value, making our normal calculation become '$23'. Subtraction reveals what the usual expenditure of getting both food and drink separately amounts to :$23-$12=|$11$. Since your single serving consumption included just ONE kind of popcorn/drink pair set rather than double or multiple sets; consequently deducing their standard rates provides us ;Popcorn+Drinks=$|11$, Drinks:$3$; therefore, Popcorn itself equals $|8 | units of currency(USD) .
