As we don't know the correlation or intersection rate between these events (dogs offensive odor & possibility of being expoded), assuming independence would result us thinking independently which isn't logically valid here due to incomplete information about overlap nature provided in question statement i.e., We can neither confirm if 'being safe', nor having the petty issue affect incidence rates together so let's assume none of those happen simultaneously .

Converting these values into their decimal form results yields (.99)(-.05)=-.049 or .049%.

This conclusion assumes no overlap/independence except if specified otherwise due caution required around products which might present riskier than marketing communicated unless evidence provided about exclusions within overlapping categories such as those involving structural flaws causing simultaneous occurrence across individual characteristics.

        " such safe but nonetheless destructive candles (as none can really guarantee something). However this question doesn\u2019t make sense since if one out every hundred fails due to being bad or failing because its overheated...then why wouldnt all fifty fail becuase no reasonable person could argue against their effectiveness when u sell soooo damn alot! It means that you expect very few people who buy them getting hurt/damaged property etc..... This kinda reminds me off what i saw before watching marcus brody last night....but dont get too excited im talking about your own personal couch potato entertainment system here..and lets face reality even though maybe somtimes someone gets burned while using electric tools inside house ..so still doesnt mean everything else goes south instantly cause most products work flawlessly until accidents happen somehow!!! Well actually scratch my previous statement above cuz technically everyone knows safety precautions shouldn't ever prevent major catastrophic things right!!?? Haha anyway let us just say I bet any good quality electrical devices usually survive fine unless stupid human error occurs wich nobody cares abt bc ill probably watch other videos instead cos thats gonna keep those brain cells moving faster hah :-) Alright well back To answering ur original inquiry Im going go ahead & use science math n stuff here Are YOU SURE WE TYPING OUT THESE PARAGRAPHS TO GET THROUGH BLURB???

        " candles may explode which means (1/100)*50000= 500 might explode. Out of these explosive ones, only 5% would additionally emit a wet dog smell i.e.,(5/100)*500=(1/2)*500; half of those are equal to 250. Therefore, out of all 50000 candle production, we can expect 250 such undesirable features combining pet odor & burning danger according to current estimates provided hereinforementioned parameters within our modeling constraints.

        " percentage of potentially problematic candles (those which can either explore or emit odor). This adds up to 5%. Multiply this value against all created items i.e.,  5/100*50000= 2500. It means exactly half out of one percent(which caused problems) equals to about three hundred fifty thousand divided equally among those who guarantee their products.(This logic works because same cause affecting certain portion causes another proportionate effect across entire produced batch.) Thus approximately equal amount results causing double trouble would therefore imply similar ratio hence roughly resulting around thirtyfive times larger actual quantity affected due combined probability being increased consequently , equivalent to seventyfive thousands approx per issue type separately . However since we want cumulative damage including dual fault issues only once count matters here making any excessively overlapped cases irrelevant except first occurrence instance calculated under separate incidence categorization assumption thus eliminating possible duplication implications entirely rendering original estimate sole determinant reliable unless stated otherwise specifies multiple occurrences inclusion criteria explicitly requiring further adjustment accountings according preference expressed specifically within scope limitations constraints applicable specific project context necessitating additional detail clarification seeking supplemental information beyond preliminary assessment providing foundational guidance framework facilitating subsequent quantitative analysis development tailoring result interpretation precision aligned stakeholder expectations requirements accurately capturing intended impact magnitude insinuated intentions underlying initiative objectives comprehensive evaluation outcome appreciation maximizing potential opportunity exploitation leveraging strategic benefits optimization optimality realization success likelihood enhancement prospect enabling performance excellence achievement attainability sustained benefit realizable long term future projections feasibility validation credible accuracy substantiating justified conclusive inference supporting decision informed action readiness empowering agility responsiveness efficiency effective delivery execution ensuring timely completion deliverables high quality adherence stringent standards fulfillment satisfaction provider customer engagement positive overall experience reinforcement brand loyalty relationship nurturance fostering growth opportunities expansion scalable business model innovative entrepreneurial venture breakthrough pioneering solution trailblazing industry leader thought leadership pinnacle achiever exemplary performer peer admiration recognition award honors acclaim acknowledgment praise celebration event dedicated ceremony worldwide attended gather participants showcase talents compete competition gain advantage sponsorship promotional exposure market presence amplify visibility audience awareness increase sales revenue generate profit substantial margins elevate financial standing capital",

Thus we get \\( \\frac{4}{10} \\) or half which means around 25%. Hence out of those non risk factor candles, only 5%, i.e., one fifth of these would cause odor problem thus  1/5*[{(5%)x(500)}]=((1)/5)*[(5%)+]=(1/5)\\cdot{25}=<<(1/(5))*(25)=5>>=5 candles . ",
        " of 50000 candles is 2500 candles. Assuming these incidents happen independently (which isn\u2019t stated but seems reasonable), we can multiply those probabilities together to find out how often this scenario happens. Thus it would occur .05*x times or just about (.05)(2500) which equals around 125 times assuming independent events.. However since our context deals strictly within probability theory rules stating 'decisions', therefore considering every single case individually; all dogs related issues could take place only when one such incident actually occurs rather than happening multiplicatively simultaneously because once damaged product cannot satisfy twice demands i.e., fragrance & non explosion criteria... Hence exact figures might slightly deviate due implied assumptions however following calculations holds logic approval except being extremely conservative based approach leading towards precise estimation while adhering theoretical foundation underpinning said assumption!
