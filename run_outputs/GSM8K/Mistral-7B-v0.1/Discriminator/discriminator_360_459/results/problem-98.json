Multiplying it against one hundred turns its equivalent decimal representation as : 0.35.. As per your request my explanation stops here but if you want me to complete up till finding out percentages I can go further .. Just let me know! Well finally multiplied by one Hundred converts above found proportion namely 'Decimals Place Representation'. Final Statement comes onto stage showing Percentage Equivalent!! ",
        " amount of puppies who have spotting (from Jennifer as well as Brandon). Divide these numbers together and multiply it by one hundred to get your percentages rounded off into whole integer representation or decimal form without rounding up/down. Percentage formula can also be expressed algebraically, P=N*x / N_total, so if we substitute values provided beforehand; Total Puppies = Jen+Ben =>  8 + 12 =   20 , Spotted Puppies =     Jen(3)+ Ben(4)        6 . By using this information above : Substitute X value within our equation again since perception was used here ; Algebraic Formula=>P=%=(Numberofspottingspuppies)*X/%Totalnumberoftotalpups",
        ". Divide the latter figure by the former one (both figures multiplied together) to get fractional value representing puppy ratio having spots. Convert this value into decimal form and finally multiply it times hundred as we deal with percentages. Jennifer's pup count:  8 Total Spotted Pups :   3+Branden\u2019s pup Count:-    12 Total Spotted Pups :-     4Step Step => 8*12=96(total No.)of PupStepped Next=> PercentageOfSpottedPups=(TotalNo.:)/no of Puppess*(%)To convert Numberintopercentage((Number):/number)*%so herePercentage Of SPottpedpups:(4 / 96 ) X ((100 %))This equation results out tobearound 4%.

Jennifer owns 8 puppies; out of those eight only three are blessed to boast with little black spots while bumping up its chance against oddness when compared with fourteen other puppies who don\u2019t carry such feature but also aren\u2019t born completely spotless like others!

        " together there are 8 + 12 = 20 puppies. Of these, we know both families collected information about spot status (spotted vs not spotted) as well; let\u2019s first consider those who reported having \u201cyes\u201d or \u201csome.\u201d To calculate this fraction out of one whole you would add up their totals while keeping track if any overlap occurred but since no commonality was mentioned I can just sum them instead adding like terms: Spotted dogs from Jennifer=3 , From Brandon it doesn't say explicitly its specified among 'not spotted', however logically implying only remaining cases could potentially indicate \u2018Yes\u2018 . Thus our calculation sums up to 3(total)+x(potentially Yes), resulting unknown value denoted by variable \\(x\\). Therefore, using algebraic approach considering scenario possibilities expressed through equations/formulas : Total Puppy count T=j+b\\n Wherein j represents Jennifer's Pup count & b denotes Brabdon's.

To find out what percent represents those particular ones we need to divide their count over overall one.: . We get 7/20=. 7/. /20 This means approximately seventeen point four or seven ten forty six per cent (%. Percentages can be represented as decimals also). Converting decimal back into %, multiply it against hundred(.7*%): ..So roughly speaking about , %.
