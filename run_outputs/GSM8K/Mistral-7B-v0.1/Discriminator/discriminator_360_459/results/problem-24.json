Hence initial amount would be represented when multiplying these three portions together i.e., units*units*unit since original was divided into fractions(parts)*likewise multiply those numbers back again resulting thusly ; hence calculate : 6.4*(6.4*6.4)= 276.48 Hectares initially existed . The answer is: 276.48.",
        " we represent all his land as 'x', (3/5)x represents what part was sold which means (2/5)x remained since only fractions make sense here considering you cannot sell half or negative portion of your property. Therefore, (2/5)x equals remaining land i.e., 12.8 ha(hectare). To find out original amount before selling it (representing this situation through simple algebraic equation), rearrange terms so that x stands alone like follow; multiplying both sides by reciprocal value= 5/(2*(x))*[(2/5)*x]=(2)(12.8)/((2))=> x=25.6 . This calculation shows us that initially Mr.Ruther owned about  25.6 hectares worth of lands , but because we normally don\u2019t use decimals when speaking measures such as these especially not smaller ones commonly used metrics system uses base unit multiples, multiply resultant figure upward until reaching nearest integer multiple hence finally comes down approximately : 26 hectares assuming every decimal implies subdivision under one hectares making sure roundup stays close enough meaningful measurement level while avoiding any possibility confusion occurring due small marginal change beyond acceptable range ; even slightest alteration could render different contextual implications leading towards discrepancies arising among interpretations involving quantitative valuation matters particularly regarding asset evaluation processes concerning ownership rights within defined territories etc ..
