        " her children. Each child received one roll, so since she feeds six children, she used up another 6 rolls altogether which leaves us with (12 \u2013 6) or 6. Finally let\u2019s divide what was left among ourselves equally as every piece contains eight parts.  6 divided by 8 equals approximately .75 per person but considering it can only happen when all individuals receive equal share hence rounded off its closest integer value i.e., zero round down because you cannot break away partially even if it would mean someone gets lesser amount like this time scenario isn't applicable otherwise ,the answer remains same still four wouldn't get anything due no whole portion cut could fit anyone perfectly thereby concluding division operation performed earlier irrelevant here also thus providing mislead any way around finding exact solution makes better sense avoid confusion therefore result comes back unchanged being none yet again resulting further complication making overall question seemingly absurdly complex without solid foundation meaning actually answering requires direct approach just substract initial quantity consumable portions already accounted within mentioned context leading directly towards logical conclusion consequently simplifying understanding process despite previous attempts overcomplicating reasoning unnecessarily turning plain calculation task itself puzzling enough deserving immediate resolution clarity achieved through straightforward computation methodology removing unwarranted complexity ensuring accuracy retained during execution maintain procedural integrity safeguarding objective achievement validated upon successful verification phase guarantee absolute preciseness sought",
        " This leaves us with 12 - 6 = 6 rolls that were broken up for the chickens. To find out how many pieces this equates to, multiply the leftover rolls (6) times the amount it was divided into per piece (8). That works like this: 6 \u00d7 8 equals",
        " out how many pieces these rolled up remained since those could all go to chickens. Each roll was broken down into eight (smaller) bits. Thus six times three equals fourteen smaller slices/pieces which went ultimately back onto their original size. Hence it amounts to , if you add both small as well as large quantity(the latter being only 6), forty minus seven or simply thirty plus seven! That translates mathematically into calculating sixty divided equally amongst twelve parts; hence our resulting value concludes upon fifteen per child before any fractional adjustments come due\u2014making this fifth solution slightly deviant yet adherent enough through contextual interpretation . Therefore considering such intricacy while deciphering complex word problems involving division yields distinct insightful results within mathematical applications beyond mere arithmetics alone!! "
