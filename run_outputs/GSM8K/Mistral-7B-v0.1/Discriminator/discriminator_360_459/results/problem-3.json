His return journey was longer due to a different road having 240 miles instead of just returning those extra 10 miles via way back so this time went through as though it would equal halfway being driven at normal length plus adding another amount; specifically we can calculate ((240+10)/2*1)\u00b2=1,160 minutes . Subtract out all previous travel times like clock hands making up only portions before hitting any whole numbers again \u2013 subtracting everything into our equation leaves us needless seconds leftover because these latter ones weren\u2019t spent driving either direction whatsoever since none existed upon completion leaving no change needed beyond simply converting units within their respective context(minutes).

His journey increased due to taking a wrong path so it actually lasted around 2.86+approx=3 hours.(because .86*60 min ~=.6 minutes or roughly half) This means he drove approximately another mile extra per minute because we can estimate every (.86)*(minutes)=(.6)+(.6)/((mile*(per hr))/(hour*(to reach destination))) =~~/.1 ((half)(of)).

Hence resulting difference about traveling times being similar yet somewhat closer values :so according those figures perhaps something like:(travelled /average )=(distance covered within first leg)->(second trips actual length divided into itself again plus remainder factor applied later calculated above!

        " additional miles due to detour distance becomes 210 miles (because it increased) which again divided by the same speed(70mph), we get new duration as 3hr approx.. Since rounding off upwards would result in loss if further calculations proceed into minutes hence keep upto first decimal point making this driving session last about **3.1** hrs till john reaches towards his friends place. Next calculate journey backward i.e., returning via different highway & higher speeds. Again using formula Total Travel Duration=Driving Session Length\u00f7different Highway\u2019s length\u00d7total Highways\u2019 distance. Inputting these values we obtain : Total Return Journey Duration=(3.1 hour)/(240 mile)*Total Mileage Back Home ; Hence our return road trip comes out approximately ~7 Hours . Thus adding both trips together you find your entire visit took around [eval(3.1+7)=10.1] **10.1 hours**.",
