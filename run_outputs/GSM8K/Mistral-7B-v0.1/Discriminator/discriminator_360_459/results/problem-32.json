However, due to the bundled discount provided upon combining them, you need to calculate the combined price less this saved amount which is equivalent to subtracting out their collective percentage off based contribution towards saving. Here we use multiplication first before subtraction since percentage calculations work best using numbers not percentages themselves so multiply original combination without any coupon i.e., just summed values times 'less than one'. Hence take net billable amounts post reduction (.80): .8(total base rate) => $.8*(original rates)(or(.9+$6)) thus bringing us down to our actual adjustment figure resulting directly into lower billing point ending value or new streamline bundle worth around $48 including the Netflix already factored under separate line item expenses mentioned above.

Hence without getting too technical here just take any whole figure greater than zero above all negative numbers like 'negative profit', minus ten percent equals lesser future loss compared versus initial larger upfront payment received plus possible further benefit gained through free advertising exposure amongst other aspects possibly available via using these same sources together rather alone individually..

Add up all streamline service costs ($10+$16) equal$26 per month plus other expenses which totals $(26+X)$. Subtract this amount from original cable price, since we need difference not actual savings $((60-26)-60)=$(34)$ saved every Month or over a year multiplied by months.(34x12=yearly saving value)(assuming one measure continuous uninterrupted consumption/ no additional features changes during these timeshift period ) ",
        " Calculate savings as follows: Since he saved 20%, find out what amount represents this percentage reduction; To calculate the discount rate or percent off price (p), use equation p/r=d where r stands for regular dollar amount & d=$10*0.2=. Use your formula above so it becomes ($10/(p))=(0.2) which means (($10)/(p)). Cross multiply both sides of the equal sign yield result as following: $10*(0+(.2)*q)=($10)(n)+(($. Simplifying yields:$2+=(.2)*$10+(.$). Divide through by $. . Therefore,. As we see,$p/$10=[.(2)-2]/$. This leaves us asking ourselves..what value substitutes into our newly created variable q?.
