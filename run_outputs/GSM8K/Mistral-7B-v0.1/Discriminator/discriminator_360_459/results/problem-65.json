Since equal amounts come back daily i.e., let us say Bird X flock comes once across all three types cumulatively over the course of one full day period or roughly equivalently when summing up the counts drawn individually during their respective visit times, this results basically being translated mathematically into 'X'.

Thus, according to these details we inferred, four such types altogether accommodate twice their own crowd plus additional twenty guests\u2014which comes out into [2*(B*6)]+[2*B] equaling to twelve sets multiplied by six individuals or seventy-two creatures entirely crowding around per cycle unless something changes up later. Therefore considering every visitor consistently returns back again without abandonment leads us concluding towards calculating precisely what quantity those avians collectively consume when put together makes them worth estimating round off within hundred range approximately near eight times larger!

To calculate precisely without assumptions just consider average time spent by customers before repeating patterns take effect\u2013for instance let \u2018x equals ten minutes because typically people spend less attention focused towards particular individuals while shopping together; therefore assuming everyone who arrives spends equal amounts upon leaving reduces overall wait length significantly resulting into lower numbers being reported ).

Six units \u00d7 twelve average expected visitors equals seventy-two potential visitors daily before considering preference differences . But because twice as many come to handmade goods versus mass produced items according to our prompt, half those sixty four guests might just shift their choice towards one group vs another based solely off personal taste alone... It would stand reasonable logic here however; say fifty percent decide against switching sides thus leaving twenty eight who opt into visitation patterns unchanged \u2013 although realistically speaking such occurrences within populations tend remain quite fluid even over short spans time periods like weekends/weekdays etc.. That leaves remaining forty % or whatever remains divided across different options available providing varying levels degrees interest depending entirely upon individual choices taken independently without regard toward other people around making similar decisions themselves either way ..
