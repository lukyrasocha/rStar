What matters here though is what happened before so let me start over Here's another way you could approach such problems : First figure out the net change per week. This time not knowing exactly which steps fireman frank goes through first or last won't hurt . Remember ; when determining something like 'total', order becomes irrelevant until later stages! To determine those latter stage totals simply sum up all relevant terms individually prior/post certain events etc.--therefore adding them together separately leads us towards answering your original query easily :) Let me know whether I understand correctly . Thank You ! Yes , thanks very helpful!! :-) Keeping count based off individual occurrences helps avoid confusion about changing conditions altogether . Good point too ---if anything unexpected happens while keeping track manually---it makes things simpler since no external factors come into play other than changes within itself ;) ) Thanks again --this really helped clarify my thought process as well ..and allowed better understanding why sometimes even seemingly redundant data points might matter...even slightly :-)) Your explanation was clear without using complicated mathematics jargon. It made sense of simple arithmetic operations involved in solving word problems related to counting objects\u2014whether buying items daily till reaching desired quantity OR removing quantities due during any partway throughout periods leading unto achieving final outcome.. Excellent work bro!!! That sounds great! Glad u enjoyed reading & understood easy peasy lemon squeezy hahaha....:) Yep yup!...:-P No worries man (: Take care myself ~ ^^",
