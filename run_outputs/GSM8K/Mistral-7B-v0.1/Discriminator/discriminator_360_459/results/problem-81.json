That makes it easier to visualize when comparing them since you might miss counting up all three types again independently; like making sure neither missed anything else besides just being careful about not confusing numbers across categories (or vice versa). We could also use modulo arithmetic here because doing things sequentially allows us avoid confusion otherwise due repetition effects but still needs additional verification via testing/comparison afterwards \u2013 so either approach works fine depending upon personal preference style preferences etc., though using simple addition seems easiest especially considering no specific order requirement was mentioned specifically relatingto these tasks within our prompt itself .
