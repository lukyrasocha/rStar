Since Toby needs to be at the airport within 60 minutes, we subtract the combined reading/travel time from these available 60 minutes. Hence, 60 minutes \u2013 40 minutes = 20 minutes. This means if everything proceeds without delay, Toby would not actually be late or ahead; rather, exactly on time according to our calculations here! However, note one possible edge case: suppose unforeseen events happen during those last crucial moments leading up to when you depart \u2014 traffic jam maybe? Or perhaps your journey took longer than expected because roads weren\u2019t clear etc. As such scenarios could lead us being even earlier which makes sense too considering situations like weather might also affect things substantially causing potential delays along routes taken thereby impact timeliness negatively thus arriving lessened hours compared what was initially calculated under usual conditions assuming regular parameters apply perfectly accurately throughout whole period observed .

Summing all these parts gets us a result : Time spent reading + Travel time+Time getting ready to go , or Total Minutes needed.=  30 mins(reading) + 20 mins(travel)=Total Miniuttes Needed=. To find out whether this leaves enough spare time before departure, subtract Total Miniutites Neededfromthe amount of free hours available (=60 minutes/hour\u00d72 hourroundtrip)+=(120mins)-(. This calculation results in finding that if nothing changes unplanned within their schedule;this person could still expect another ((120min.(sparefreeonarrivalatairports )-(totaltimealldoneincludingtransit))),(which simplifies down into roughly ~47~extra seconds ).

We subtract any unused time within our estimation window before departure date plus those unexpected delays caused due weather changes especially during winter months across different regions worldwide known better than others which affect passengers heavily hence making them late often...

Therefore avoid risk taking unnecessary risks wherever possible unless absolutely necessary else save yourself lots headache later!!!

Given that he only has one hour until departure, calculating when he will actually need to start, we see he already stays well within schedule even without any contingencies since all these add up to less than 60 mins., which leaves plenty of margin considering potential unforeseen events or possible slower driving speed leading into traffic situations nearer the destination city itself.

Thus we inferred here based solely upon literal interpretation provided details about exact timing requirements mentioned earlier without consideration any possible delays encountered during real life scenarios like unexpected traffic conditions..
