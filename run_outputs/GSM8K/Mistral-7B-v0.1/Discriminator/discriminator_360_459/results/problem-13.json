        " 160000 = 240000 working (non-faulty) piece(s). Therefore, since every non-defective item costs them their full price ($/item), all those items cost them equally as if none was defective; thus spending altogether still equals the original value. This implies that this result refers per individual good and ignores grouping or quantity differences among different kinds of goods etc., so here it would mean just taking out the part corresponding to the bad products plus its proportionate sum into consideration like following :    $$ {Total Money Spent} =   Original_Amount -\\ ({Fault\\%}_{Wanted}(Original_{Amount}))$$where \\$({Fault\\%}_{Wanted})=(Bad Items)\\times\\frac{CashPerItem}{FullItems}$$In our scenario $$\\text{\\${Fault\\%}_{Wanted}}=\\$\\frac{(40\\% \\text{-}\\ NumberOfGoodly)})}{\\text{$(\\sum All\\_Pieces)}=-\\&\\frac{\\left(\\$160,000 (\\right){(-)(AllBases)}\\right){\\frac{($1,000)}{\\text{$(All Bases)}}}{\\sqrt[]{\\binom{TotalNr}{(EachBase)}\\cdot[Probabilities]^n}}=-\\ &\\frac{(\\$160,\\!000)}{4}=\\&\\boxed{\\$40,000}$$<|end_of_solution|>",

Thus, one gets $(400000 \\times 60)/100=($4000\\div  10)\\times(6)=$40\\times 6=$240000 . Therefore, their spending totaled up to $240000 when buying working items. The answer is: $240000.",
