To reach the goal for one month which is 72 vlogs, subtract what she produced so far; it\u2019s going to take another amount to finish making them throughout remaining weeks.. This means you need additional vlogs equaling your target minus all created during these past few weeks...

Fourth week finally gets us down into normal zone again because both numbers match exactly :) Hence altogether throughout all four current records Emily already accomplished or delivered 2 extra videos compared to usual rate!

To calculate whether or not she met up with her daily goals before reaching their overall objective., add together all produced products . We know she achieved what she wanted to achieve within its scope over three cycles; thus we conclude that no changes need to be implemented because although she exceeded her production capacity during the middle period of time throughout the course of these seven working sessions, even though those records cannot be reversed back into previously unobtainable data space once released beyond our purview, nonetheless having failed through said action taken whilst performing regular duties still remains possible regardless being aware due diligence performed prior completion upon receipt confirmation ensuring accurate representation thereby maintain consistent standards compliance..
