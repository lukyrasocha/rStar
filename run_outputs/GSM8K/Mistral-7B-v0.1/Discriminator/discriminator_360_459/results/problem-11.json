Half of the sales from Saturday would therefore be equal to halving our prior result i.e., 28 / 2 equals to 14 pairs. However, since there are also six customers who return their purchases or purchase not fitted ones back into the stock meaning only those initially purchased count towards this calculation. Hence you need to reduce 14(from second transaction) substracted with these 6 unpaired orders resulting zero productable units sold during this period within the stipulated timeframe henceforth accounting as no additional buyers reached up until the cutoff point.
