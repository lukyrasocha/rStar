Add together distances covered into one full month (i.e., summing them both), making you get 800+240=<<800+240=1040>>1040 kilometers throughout these weeks overall.

Therefore if our initial journey covered approximately 800km & lastly decreased about 30%, It would roughly equal(to nearest decimal point) : 800Km \u2013 ((30 / 100)*  800 Kms )= approx ~560 KMs .

With such variations being factored into account comes up another question \u201cHow long took him till reaching destination\u201d.

Hence basically concluding rather neatly avoiding potential discrepancies caused arising merely concerning previously calculated figures combined alongside real world contextual concerns making sure calculations remain reliable throughout remainder analysis despite unknown external influences likely existing elsewhere surrounding present scenario subject matter under consideration plus hopefully reaffirming accuracy levels amongst practitioners utilised primarily related fields involving precise data handling techniques employed whenever possible ensuring exact results attainable sooner subsequent examinations required providing necessary guidance essential meeting predetermined standards applicable strictly adherent principles established respectively facilitating seamless collaboration albeit occasionally conflicting interests perhaps causing divergence towards oppositional views seeking common ground",
