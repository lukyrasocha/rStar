We already found Josh made 9 but since it says kilseymadetwicemorecookiesthanjoshweaddetogetherwiththesucksonthisequals(K+J). This tells us kg=(k)+j . Using our numbers so far,kg=(k)+9 , because j=9 Remember earlier you wrote JHS which i assume stands for Jose\u2019s House Selling price ? Well remember Jose only sold half! That makes everything change just like if Joe Biden said I sell three million books instead of selling millions.. But don\u2019t let your brain go haywire thinking what would happen here!! Just multiply them both by 2.(Tried doing factorization)(This question isn\u2019t very clean though\u2026 Anyways my math skills arentruistic anyway sorry!) ",

Since we know Suzanne\u2019s count was 36, multiplying it by .5 yields Josh having baked fifteen sixteenths or twelve points (because three quarters divided into fourth parts) worth seven point twentyfive which when reduced using only whole numbers comes down to forty percent of fifty pies being approximately eleven pie slices meaning about elevenths (halfway through adding another slice before reaching exactly ten).

However, looking backward it appears my prior calculation contains an error since I multiplied when what was needed was division due to 'one fourth'. Therefore let me correct myself; When calculating Josch's count, use fractional representation instead of directly dividing by four i.e., get the result of multiplication such as ((1)/(4))*(Total_cookies).

Likewise, since it was also stated, Josh only produced   1/4 what suzanne accomplished; thus equipping us with knowing that josh actually created 1/4*{suzzane}={j}, substituting {suzzane}' s value into our equation yields :  2*{joshes}={Kelsi};    2*(36/4)=2*9=. Which leads me to conclude that Kelsi generated exactly 18 boxes worth cookis ; hence concluding your question. Here comes the complete solution: Assuming `y` represents thousands when converting currencies such as euros or pounds might not always apply due to fluctuating exchange rates.
