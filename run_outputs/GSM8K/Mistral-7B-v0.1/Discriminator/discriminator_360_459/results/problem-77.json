Divide this quantity among all six people including themselves, so you need to divide it amongst seven people since 'six others' means excluding Juri and Sitit herself. Therefore when dividing up the fruits, every person gets about equal amount i.e., no remainder can occur if we use whole numbers without fractions. Using long division method would help here but let us perform mental math using estimation first which might make sense because large numbers like these sometimes seem too complex even though simple. To simplify things further consider breaking down big digits into smaller ones as follows; split groups according divisibility rules : break apart tens place digit(as hundreds aren\u2019t relevant anymore), say groupings could look something along those lines \u2014\u00a03+4=7 ; 4+2=6 . This leaves us simply distributing single units across individuals rather than having any remainders\u2014thus making fair sharing possible within practical limits allowing adjustments only through addition/subtraction operations based off fractional remains derived during initial allocations depending upon individual preference needs etc..
