Considering variables such as initial amount (monthly_income), regular savings goal every year (yearly_goal) and periodic deductions/expenses(deduction). First create this basic formula structure: SAVINGSPerMonth=([InitialAmount+YearlyGoal]-(Deduction)*(NumberOfPeriod))   Use these guidelines while applying functions within our example context: Initial Amount ($): We start off saving nothing initially let\u2019s say we get paid once a month so Monthly income=$100; Yearly Savings Goal (X% conversion)=$5k/$12 months*100%=approximately %416($5000*(yield \u2248416)). Deductions can include variable things but let's assume no spending other than necessary expenses i.e., rent $(rent)$ ,food$(food)$, utilities$(utilities)$. Let's apply them into equations below :    Using MSExcel Function FV(): Assuming annual interest rates varies from cell B1 through J1 (for simplicity purpose)     Here E1 represents percentage yield converted from cells Cells b1 upto j1 . This yields us different result according to difference percentages ranging downward from range **B1** (**A1**)+range **C1** (**A2**)+..to..., plus ranges **F1** (**A4**) through **K1** (**A7**); minus all elements mentioned earlier representing individual debts subtractible away respectively.\r",
