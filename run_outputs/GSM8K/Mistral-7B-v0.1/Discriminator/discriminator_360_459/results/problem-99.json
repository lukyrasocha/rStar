        " oats, four 1-pound boxes (for both sides) of sugar cubes which equals eight pounds as one box contains half kg or approximately .5 pound and it mentions double quantity since we buy these for every horse hence making another side too. And lastly, identifying the weight for Carrots isn\u2019t specifically stated but you mentioned calculating their cost based just on knowing if 'freshness was important', implying this means individual weights aren\u2019t relevant; thus don't include those either. Finally calculate the sum up volume and see whether fits within what load carrying capacity exists i.e., maximum possible loads per journey considering loading space limitations). Adding everything together, you get ((42*75)+(20*65)+(2)*1)= about  3930 pounds.
