Add up all the apples collected by both siblings, except those picked from the average trees by Joanne. These would include 30 (from tallest tree), plus four times what was mentioned earlier about doubled numbers being joined onto it when compared against Joanne, so another sixteen tens making eighty minus ten already counted makes seventy apples; forty-five ones taken away leave thirty-nine. Adding everything altogether leads us to seventy less twenty leaves fifty-nine.
