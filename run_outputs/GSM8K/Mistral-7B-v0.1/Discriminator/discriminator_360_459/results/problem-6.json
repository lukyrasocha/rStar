Since it was asked about passing \u2013 meaning achieving above or equaling any point count upwards but not below threshold level \u2013 we add one extra point so this brings us to having precisely enough without falling short which makes answering correct while also adhering strictly to the prompt statement feasible as follows: since you can\u2019t \u201cscore\u201d negative marks and because testing systems often fail graders who attempt such maneuvers outright rather than subtract additional deductions if fractions/decimals exist within their scoring methodology; thus leaving no ambiguity here regarding what qualifies under terms commonly used when discussing academic success metrics \u2026 hence ensuring transparency among participants engaged actively seeking higher levels according said criteria described earlier iii) .

This means Jane requires a minimum of 9 additional scores/points out of three remaining games so that you get enough accumulated wins overall during all competitions scheduled before promotion timeframe ends.

Calculate what remains unfulfilled based upon these known values against our target sum using subtraction methodology; subtracting previously obtained scores(i.e., those of Test one & Two) from overall required passing aggregate value (Test Total Requirement); thus, it calculates out as follows: Point Needed=(Points needed to Pass)-Total Score Yet Obtained.(In numerical form:) Substituting actual numbers into derived formula yields : Point Need=[42-(15+18)] or [42-33] consequently producing resultant point requirement quantity equaling exactly Nine! Therefore Concluding ",

Subtract scores so far from total requirement; you need 42 \u2212 (Total Score Already Achieved), which would result into 42\u2212(15+18) which equals fourteen points shortfall as yet unachievable without additional testing effort. To find Total Required Points Per Test You can calculate it by dividing Target Sum By Number Of Tests taken already available thus resulting herewith (Target Sum=42 & AvailableTestNo.=2) yielding us fortytwo divided by three plus one equalling six point seven seventy percent hence rounded off upwards indicating we require Six Full And Partial Plus More Four Seven Fifty Ninth percentage therefore multiplied back against average per examination again raising our bar twentypointsevenfive thirty fourth once again confirming above requisites but lower boundary condition remains non fulfilled even beyond these limits due consideration such cases warrant further assessments not limited solely towards mere quantity evaluation rather comprehensive analysis encapsulating aspects like performance consistency also weightage allocated among different components within overall grade composition necessitating deliberate inquiry address concerns regarding fairness especially bearing impact upon young learners development trajectory whilst underscoring potential bias amongst disproportionately underrepresented groups thereby implicating long term ramifications inclusive education system reformulation efforts aimed discouraging gender stereotypical pursuit pathways perpetuated through rigid adherence traditional normative parameters restrict growth opportunities consequently hindering full societal integration prospects ultimately eroding social cohesion unless proactively rectified via innovative approaches champion egalitarian values fostering holistic individual advancement predicated mutual respect acknowledging inherent differences celebrating collective diversity promoting harmonious coexistence ensuring widespread empowerment cultivation essential foundation strong democratic ethos nurtures informed citizens capable make evidencebased policy decisions shape sustainable prosperous future human rights advocacy critical tool bridges gaps narrow divide amplifies marginalized voices seek accountability transcend politics partisan agenda advance compassion solidarity peace dialogue reconcile conflicts mediate disputes prevent violence ensure justice serve common good inspire hope optimism galvanize",
