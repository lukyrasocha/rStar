Therefore, using both criteria \u2013 scoring above 80 and not falling short during testing\u2013the conclusion derived can differ if one sticks strictly by only numerical criterion without factor in qualitative assessments like consistency etc., It also might vary depending whether certain schools adopt letter grades versus numeral scales .
