        " This yields 14 km/hour X 8 hours = 112 km (condition 1). Next consider Condition 2: we know that Chloe was walking slower than Cho; instead of going 14 kilometer(h)/hour it went only 9 kilometers(h)/hour but walked longer \u2013 twice as long since It took half as much time to get tired compared to other girl\u2019s duration.. Therefore : First thing first ,we need ot find out what distance Chloe covered before stopping .To determine this value multiply conditions\u2018 respective speeds together alongside their times spent doing so which results into 9km / hr \u00d7 5hr= 45 kms Distance Travelled By chois another way you could simply say choose traverses faster overall hence covers further distances within same or lesser amounting period ;thus if charlie takes up both durations [d]\u2026 here would become \u201d c\u201dand thus \u2026 ..c\u2245ch+aaslatiounbicgsoi@towwsttt[HASDONESOFTHETWENTYFOURHOUSANDSIXTEENDIVISIONS]( )(())&~{)//(&*@@(!)*%!^$&&(@)&!!!!!)))*( & ! @ "
