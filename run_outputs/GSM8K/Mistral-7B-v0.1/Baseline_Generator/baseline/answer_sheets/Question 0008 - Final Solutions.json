Since there are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense, let's set the number of players on the defense to x. Then the number of players on the offense is 2x. Next, identify the number of players on the special teams. Since there is half the number of players on the special teams as there is on the defense, the number of players on the special teams is x/2. Now, since there are 105 players in total, that means the sum of the numbers of players on each team must add up to 105. 2x + x/2 + x is 105. Solving this equation for x, we get 3x = 105.
