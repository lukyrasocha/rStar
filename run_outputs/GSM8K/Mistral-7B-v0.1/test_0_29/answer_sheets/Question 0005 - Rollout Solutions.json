Kylar wanted to buy 16 glasses. Every other glass costs 60% of the original price, so we can calculate it this way: [1*$5] + [2*0.6*$5] + [3*0.6^2*$5] + ... + [15*0.6^14*$5] + [16*0.6^15*$5]. Each bracket contains a different glass. Since Kylar buys 16 glasses, we can just sum up the values. Using python code:\n```\nsum([1*5] + [2*0.6*5] + [3*0.6^2*5] + ... + [15*0.6^14*5] + [16*0.6^15*5])\n```\nSumming all these values together should give the total amount.", "value": 0.2}, "ost_step": {}}, "4": {"subquestion": "Now we can answer the question: How much does he need to pay for them?", "subanswer": {"text": "He needs to pay 75.2 dollars.

To simplify this expression, we can use the sum formula: sum(n)= n(a_1+a_2+...+an) / n = (a_1+a_2+...+an) / 1 = a_1 + a_2 + ... + an, where n is the number of terms and ai is the ith term.
