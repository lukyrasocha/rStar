Let's start with Condition 1. 1 chicken meal costs $12, and 5 packs of milk cost $3 each. That means it would cost 12 + 5 x 3 = 29 dollars.

Condition 3 tells us that Marie orders pizza packaged in boxes. We know how much she spent in total, so we can calculate how many boxes of pizza she ordered. Since she only spent 35 dollars on the chicken meals, the milk, and the apples, we know that the rest of her money was spent on the pizza. The pizza costs 8 dollars per box, so we can divide the remaining amount by 8. That gives us 35 / 8 = 4.25. The answer is: 4 boxes of pizza.
