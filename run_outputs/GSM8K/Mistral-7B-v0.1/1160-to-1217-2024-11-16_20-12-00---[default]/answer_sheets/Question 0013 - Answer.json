{"id": 1173, "problem": "A regular box of 100 dishwasher pods costs $12. There's currently a special size box for the same price that has 20% more pods. How many dishwashing cycles with the new box can you run for $1 if you use 1 pod per cycle?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "If the regular box has 100 pods and the special one has 20% more, then the new box has 100 * 20% = 20 more pods\nIf the new one has 20 more pods than the regular one, the new box has a total of 20+100 = <<20+100=120>>120 pods\nIf the cost of the regular box ($12) is the same as the new box, then the new box also costs $12\nIf the new box has 120 pods and the price for the box is $12, then each pod costs $12/120 = $<<12/120=0.10>>0.10\nIf 1 pod costs $0.10 and is used in 1 cycle, then each cycle costs = $<<1*0.10=0.10>>0.10\nIf 1 cycle costs $0.10, then for $1 I could run $1/$0.1 = 10 cycles\n#### 10", "gold_answer": "10"}
