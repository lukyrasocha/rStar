If each pack has 5 pens, how many pens does Alain have?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "Alain has a total of 5 x 5= <<5*5=25>>25 red pens.\nAnd he has a total of 5 x 2 = <<5*2=10>>10 packs of black pens.\nSo, the total number of black pens he has is 10 x 5 = <<10*5=50>>50.\nTherefore, the total number of pens he has is 50 + 25= <<50+25=75>>75.\n#### 75", "gold_answer": "75"}
