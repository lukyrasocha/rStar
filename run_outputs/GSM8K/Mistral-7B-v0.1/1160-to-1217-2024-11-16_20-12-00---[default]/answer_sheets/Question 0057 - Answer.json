How much did Pauline spend on all visits to the museum?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "Pauline visited the local museum 3 times a year, so she paid 3 * 2 = $<<3*2=6>>6 every year on visits.\nThat means during the first 5 years Pauline spend 5 * 6 = $<<5*6=30>>30 on tickets.\nAfter 5 years the cost of one visit increased by 150/100 * 2 = $<<150/100*2=3>>3.\nThat means the new price of the ticket was 2 + 3 = $<<2+3=5>>5.\nSo for per year Pauline paid 3 * 5 = $<<3*5=15>>15.\nDuring the last 3 years, she paid in total 3 * 15 = $<<3*15=45>>45.\nIn total Pauline spend 30 + 45 = $<<30+45=75>>75 on visits at the museum.\n#### 75", "gold_answer": "75"}
