Condition 1: 5-inch chalk is given to the teacher. Condition 2: To avoid waste, the teacher writes for a maximum of 20% of the available chalk each day. Condition 3: On the first day (Monday), the teacher ends up writing more than usual due to student needs and uses up 45% of the chalk. Question: Assuming the teacher returns to his regular practice of writing with only 20% of the chalk per day, how many days does he have before having to recycle the current piece of chalk?", "ost_step": {}}, "1": {"subquestion": "How much chalk does the teacher have left after using 45% of the chalk on the first day?", "subanswer": {"text": "Let's think step by step. We know the teacher starts with 5 inches of chalk. Also, we know that the teacher wrote for 45% on Monday. So the remaining amount is 5 * (100 - 45) / 100 = 5 * 55 / 100 = 2.75 inches.
