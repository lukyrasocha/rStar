As per the problem statement, John was twice as old as Jim on Digimon's 20th anniversary. Hence, if John was 'x' years old then Jim must be half of 'x'. In other words, we can say, John = x years old and Jim = x/2 years old.", "2": "Secondly, since the current age of John is 28 years old, we can use this information to find the age of Jim. We know that currently, John is x years old and was half of his age at Digimon's 20th anniversary. Therefore, Jim's current age can be calculated as follows:", "3": "Jim's current age = John's current age - (John's age at Digimon's 20th anniversary)/2"}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's think step by step.
