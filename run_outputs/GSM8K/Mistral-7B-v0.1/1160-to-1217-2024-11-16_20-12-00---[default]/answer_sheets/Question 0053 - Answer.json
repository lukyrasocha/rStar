{"id": 1213, "problem": "Stephen borrowed $300 from his sister and promised to return it with an additional 2% of the money he owed. For 11 months Stephen will give his sister $25 per month and the remaining amount, including the interest, will be paid on the twelfth month. How much will Stephen pay in the twelfth month?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "Stephen will pay an additional $300 x 2/100 = $<<300*2/100=6>>6.\nHe should return a total of $300 + $6 = $<<300+6=306>>306.\nFor eleven months Stephen will pay a total of $25 x 11 = $<<25*11=275>>275.\nTherefore, Stephen will pay 306 - 275 = $<<306-275=31>>31 on the twelfth month.\n#### 31", "gold_answer": "31"}
