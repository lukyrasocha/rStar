{"id": 1161, "problem": "Abraham owns 80 square meters of unused land. He sold half of the land for $50, and after a month, he sold another 1/4 of his land for $30. He then sold the remaining land for $3 per square meter. How much money will he be able to earn after selling all his unused land?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "Abraham sold 1/2 x 80= <<1/2*80=40>>40 square meters of his unused land.\nAfter a month, he sold 1/4 x 40 = <<1/4*40=10>>10 square meters of his land.\nSo, the total land he already sold is 40+10= <<50=50>>50 square meters of his land.\nHe has 80 - 50 = <<80-50=30>>30 remaining land to be sold at $3 per square meter.\nSo he earned $3 x 30 = $<<3*30=90>>90 for that land.\nTherefore, he earned a total of $50 + $30 + $90 = $<<50+30+90=170>>170.\n#### 170", "gold_answer": "170"}
