Similarly because Tolouse\u2019s number of animal equals double what charlestons have (Charlestons > Seattles), so it follows that Toulouse would possess 80*2=. Therefore Toulouse possesses 160 . Thus all three collectively own  160+80+20= [eval(160+80+20)=260]260. This means Toulouse, Charleston & Paris possess altogether 260 . That corresponds most closely with Choice C : 260 .
