[{"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Kylar went to the store to buy glasses for his new apartment. One glass costs $5, but every second glass costs only 60% of the price. Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses. How much does he need to pay for them?", "ost_step": {"1": "Determine the cost per glass. Each glass costs $5, but every second glass costs only 60% of the price, so we can say that each glass costs either $5 or $3.", "2": "Calculate the number of glasses that cost $5 and the number of glasses that cost $3. We want to buy 16 glasses, so let's say that we buy 2 glasses that cost $5 and 14 glasses that cost $3.", "3": "Find the sum of the prices of the glasses. Two glasses cost $5 x 2 = $10 and 14 glasses cost $3 x 14 = $42, so the total cost is $10 + $42 = $52.", "4": "The answer is $52.", "5": "The answer is $52."}}}, "rollout_id": 0}]
