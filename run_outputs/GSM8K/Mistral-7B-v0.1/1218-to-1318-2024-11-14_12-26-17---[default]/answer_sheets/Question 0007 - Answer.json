{"id": 1225, "problem": "Carly is making cupcakes and brownies for her art class. She makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. If Carly's class has five people and each person gets two treats, how many cupcakes did Carly make?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "First, figure out how many total treats Carly made for her class by multiplying the number of people in the class by the number of treats per person: 5 people * 2 treats/person = <<5*2=10>>10 treats\nNext, express the number of brownies in terms of the number of cupcakes based on the problem information: b = 3c - 2, where b is the number of brownies and c is the number of cupcakes\nWe know that b + c = 10, the total number of treats, so now we can substitute in the expression for b from the last step: 3c - 2 + c = 10\nNow we combine like terms to get 4c - 2 = 10\nWe add two to both sides of the equation to get 4c = 12\nFinally, we divide both sides by 4 to get c = 3\n#### 3", "gold_answer": "3"}
