{"id": 1272, "problem": "Helen went on a trip through Germany. She booked a hotel for 3 nights and rode the bus 7 times during that trip. One night at the hotel was a cost of $80, and every bus trip was 10% of the price of one night at the hotel. How much did Helen pay for the hotel and bus travels during that trip?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "Helen has spent 3 nights at the hotel, so she needed to pay 3 * 80 = $<<3*80=240>>240 for them.\nOne bus trip was the cost of 80 * 10/100 = $<<80*10/100=8>>8.\nHelen rode the bus 7 times, so she paid 7 * 8 = $<<7*8=56>>56 for that.\nIn total, Helen paid 240 + 56 = $<<240+56=296>>296 in total.\n#### 296", "gold_answer": "296"}
