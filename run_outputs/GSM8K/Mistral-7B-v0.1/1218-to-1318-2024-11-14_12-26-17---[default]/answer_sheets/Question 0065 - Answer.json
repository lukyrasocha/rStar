How much money does Frances have left?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "20 cupcakes cost 20 x $2 =$<<20*2=40>>40.\n40 cookies cost 40 x $1 = $<<40*1=40>>40.\nSo, Frances earns $40 + $40 = $<<40+40=80>>80 for selling cupcakes and cookies.\nThe cost of five trays is 5 x $4 = $<<5*4=20>>20.\nTherefore, France will have $80 - $20 = $<<80-20=60>>60 left.\n#### 60", "gold_answer": "60"}
