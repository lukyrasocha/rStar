{"id": 1259, "problem": "Derrick has a bakery that makes 10 dozen doughnuts every day, selling at $2 per doughnut. How much money does Derrick make in June if he sells all the doughnuts?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "A dozen doughnuts have 12 doughnuts, and if Derrick makes 10 dozen in a day, the total number of doughnuts he makes is 10*12 = <<10*12=120>>120 doughnuts.\nSince each doughnut sells at $2 per piece, Derrick makes 120*$2 = $<<120*2=240>>240 per day from selling his doughnuts.\nIn June, with 30 days, after making and selling the doughnuts every day, Derrick makes $240*30 = $<<30*240=7200>>7200\n#### 7200", "gold_answer": "7200"}
