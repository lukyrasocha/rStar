{"id": 1276, "problem": "James wants to hang crepe-paper streamers from his backyard fence for his birthday party. His backyard fence is a rectangle that measures 20 feet on the long side and 15 feet on the short side. How many feet of crepe paper does James need to buy?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "First figure out how much crepe paper James needs for the long sides. Since there are two long sides, multiple the side's length by 2: 20 feet * 2 = <<20*2=40>>40 feet\nNow do the same multiplication to find out how much crepe paper James needs for the short sides: 15 feet * 2 = <<15*2=30>>30 feet\nNow add the amounts for the short and long sides together to find the total amount of crepe paper needed: 40 feet + 30 feet = <<40+30=70>>70 feet\n#### 70", "gold_answer": "70"}
