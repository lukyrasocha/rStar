Condition 1:  James plans to decorate his rectangular backyard fence (with dimensions 20 feet long and 15 feet wide) for his party. Condition 2: He intends to string crepe-paper streamers across the length of the fence. Question: How much streamer material does James require to achieve this effect?", "ost_step": {"1": "Identify the dimensions of the fence. The problem states that the backyard fence is 20 feet long and 15 feet wide.", "2": "Assume each streamer is 1 foot wide. This means we need one streamer for every foot along the length of the fence.", "3": "Multiply the length of the fence (20 feet) by its width (15 feet). This gives us the area of the fence.", "4": "Divide the area by the width of the streamer (in this case 1 foot). This gives us the number of streamers required to cover the entire fence."}}}, "rollout_id": 28}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "James wants to hang crepe-paper streamers from his backyard fence for his birthday party.
