[{"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "A new program had 60 downloads in the first month. The number of downloads in the second month was three times as many as the downloads in the first month, but then reduced by 30% in the third month. How many downloads did the program have total over the three months?", "ost_step": {"1": "Calculate the number of downloads in the second month. The problem states the downloads increased by three times compared to the first month. So, the number of downloads in the second month is three times the number of downloads in the first month. In the first month there were 60 downloads. So, the number of downloads in the second month is 60 * 3 = 180 downloads.", "2": "Calculate the number of downloads in the third month. The problem states the number of downloads decreased by 30% compared to the second month. So, the number of downloads in the third month is 30% less than the number of downloads in the second month. Since the number of downloads in the second month is 180 downloads, the number of downloads in the third month is 180 - (180 * 0.3) = 120 downloads.", "3": "Add up the number of downloads in each month to get the total. In the first month there were 60 downloads, in the second month there were 180 downloads, and in the third month there were 120 downloads. So, the total number of downloads is 60 + 180 + 120 = 360 downloads.", "4": "The answer is 360.", "5": "The final step is to present the result in a sentence or phrase. The number of downloads for the new program was 60 in the first month, 180 in the second month, and 120 in the third month. This adds up to a total of 360 downloads over the three months."}}}, "rollout_id": 0}]
