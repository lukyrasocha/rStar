To determine their overall prices you can take into account these expenses together. Thus putting them all into one equation would look like X = H+J+(P). Here's another methodology involving averages(mean): first calculate the mean or middle price among your items because those come within our context (hat &jacket) meaning M=(H+J)/2 =>M=(75/2)=$37.
