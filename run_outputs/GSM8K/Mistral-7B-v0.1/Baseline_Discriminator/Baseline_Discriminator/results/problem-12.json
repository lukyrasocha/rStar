Recheck your math when handling calculations involving large numbers especially those incorporating both multiplication and division operations since these kinds of mathematical problems often require careful attention towards detail within computations including accurate figure manipulation while ensuring proper adherence to order operation procedures like following BODMAS rule due their potential complexity causing frequent errors if overlooked hence my advice would indeed lean toward suggesting better preparation strategies perhaps through breaking down complex tasks separately thereby reducing confusion during calculation processes overall improving effectiveness whilst simultaneously enhancing accuracy therefore good luck!

Add them up before calculating the percentage off like this: Total cost = ($7.5+$0.5) + $12 + $10=. This equals $30. To get a figure equivalent to the amount paid when receiving 10 percent less you need first to divide your initial sum i..e ,total_cost/((1-.9)) or just calculate $.($30/.9$).This results into $33.33 approximately based on standard division rules which dictate we round values following four significant figures rule starting from ones place hence resulting to three digits post decimal point.
