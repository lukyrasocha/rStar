To calculate those liking yellow as well subtract both groups from your starting population size ie., Number of Students Liking Blue+Number of Pupils loving Green=(Blue)+(Green)=20+(5)=25 Thus leaving you with Remaining Population Size-(Total Preference)/Color Countie Yellow Equation becomes ;Remainder From Starting Group Not accountableTo any Color GroupsInvertorPreference/(County).
