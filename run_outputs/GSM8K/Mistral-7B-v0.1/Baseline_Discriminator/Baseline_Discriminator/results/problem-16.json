Multiply these values together so you know what value represents both variables combined into one single figure worth calculating against; 4000*3.5=14,000 ($). This means this variable expression calculates out based on multiple facts provided earlier within our prompt (i.e., price paid versus volume delivered), which further simplifies down nicely once calculated due diligence becomes possible without any ambiguity arising during its evaluation process.(if we\u2019re talking about only part(a) above alone \u2013 i don\u2019t really see why someone would need help here!) To determine proportionately applicable quantities regarding returns made related specifically towards 'passed over before shelf life ends', divide those factors accordingly via division operation below\u2026 As such:- Total Expired Amount Of Milk=(total sale)/proportion=>((Total Sales)+Frozen Purchase Price)*Proportional Represenative Value => ((Total Units Sold)(Cost Per Unit))/(No Useful Product Available)=()(4000*(3.5))/(??)where ??: Is used placeholders instead but still signifying usable product available throughout entire range stated elsewhere otherwise described underneath statement \u2018identifiying specific numbers involved alongside said calculation\u2018 subsection mentioned next.)

Each jar contained one dollar worth of liquid cow\u2019s milk which costs 3.5 dollars hence we can conclude; if the value of goods was divided equally among all units present i.e.; liters within the containers thus it means that one container or liter contains around .7$ because when you divide three point five (.7) times four thousand equals twelve hundred pounds twenty six cents ($12,26.) as confirmed earlier but since this question assumes one penny( $.01 )=one cup therefore multiply eleven sixty seven cent(.167),which would equal roughly 5 people buying ten cups apiece making fifty cups altogether. This translates into about seventy eight percent being thrown away while thirtytwo percent remains sellable so far less than half still edible due too extreme losses caused mostly though negligence however let us examine what actually happened during those few weeks following delivery here goes : first off , customers came rushing through doors only wanting fresh dairy products immediately afterwards sales dropped considerably especially last weekend before vacations began leaving stock piled throughout stores unbought till next year sometimes never seen again ; additionally another factor compounding our loss percentage lies behind inventory system failure leading ultimately towards wasteful management issues such proper storage methods ought really applied everywhere including cooling devices located near exitways allowing spoilage inside shelves instead stay outside until checked daily prevent possible problems like freezer burn along side mold growth etc.. secondly considering average consumption rates used worldwide estimates show numbers hover just under forty million cubes every single hour across numerous continents combined together bringing them close enough yet somewhat slower overall output meaning maybe even faster depletion depending exactly whom own consuming these items versus quantity available ? finally understanding common behavioral patterns amongst humans reveals fact simple majority consume large amounts regularly resulting increased demand placing pressure strain already existing supply lines requiring further attention regarding distribution logistics keeping track quantities moving effectively ensuring customer satisfaction levels meet desired goals thereby boost confidence consumer retention driving up business profit margins improving industry standards promoting positive change affecting society positively encouraging better future preparedness against crises threatening global populations regardless age group whether young children adult families elder citizens seniors military personnel veterans civilians homeless hungry strangers alike thanks largely benefitting everyone involved providing assistance wherever needed without fear prejudice discrimination favoritism greed nor hate motivated actions taking advantage exploiting others innoc",
        " Next find what fraction was spoiled when found out about its condition. When counted upon it turned out this jar contained only 3/5 (as stated above) good product. This means approximately 2 parts out of every 5 products was bad or undrinkable which implies that roughly  2/5=1*2/(5)=2/5 part remained unsellable meaning half needed returning.
