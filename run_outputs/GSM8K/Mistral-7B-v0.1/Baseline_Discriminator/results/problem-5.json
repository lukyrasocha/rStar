Let\u2019s delve deeper even though both kids love basketball, Emma likes playing while Jack prefers watching matches on TV..

        " $60. John bought 2 pairs per child which totals in 2*3= <<2*3=6>>6 pairs. Therefore, if we multiply this quantity against the unitary selling price (which was given as $60) ,we get that he paid in all : 6*$60=$<<6*60=360>>360 . So,he spent $360 entirely. This exercise helps practice multiplication within real world context scenarios involving prices and quantities or items involved. It also underscores understanding simple operations like addition & subtraction underpinned through practical mathematic computations while using basic language comprehension skills \u2013 both crucial aspects when tackling mathematics problems directly related or applicable beyond classroom learning environments such as financial budgeting among others.
