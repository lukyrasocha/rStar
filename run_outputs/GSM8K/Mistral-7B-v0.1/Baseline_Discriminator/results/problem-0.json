Because running speed doesn\u2019t change across every different activity type like jumping long distances vs short but fast jumps etc., this wouldn't affect the amount accumulated because units stay constant through all calculations without conversion factor needed (like converting minutes into hours since speeds always use km/h) Also note repetition pattern\u2014we see uniformity here; hence no changes occur during any replica phase due its regularized nature throughout experiments conducted daily making process straightforward & less complex thereby avoid requiring additional formulaic components(which would otherwise create unnecessary complexity when solving equations using conventional methods); however upon further review&analysis though most people may assume such simple arithmetic might suffice yet often overlook various factors involvedin determining true overall results especially considering variables within individual activities impacting performance levels differently based primarily off biological physiology characteristics differ amongst individuals regardless physical fitness status.(For example why someone could complete multiple miles easily while another struggles only able lift relatively small amounts despite being significantly stronger via training regimen.)
