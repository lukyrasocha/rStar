        " grade, Audrey needs to achieve a passing percentage of 70%. This means (total passed / all) X 100 = Passing Percentage; substituting what we know into this equation yields ((correct passes on both exams/all exam questions). We want our resulting value multiplied by 100 percentages equal or greater than 70%; since everything except '(answers needed out of 2nd question)' remains constant,(answer desired)/((passes already achieved)+(future targets))=desired target percentage*100/(question remaining+second attempt)=target goal percentage*(examination length)-already completed effort=(number sought per problem)(length of attempted problems); solving using algebra reveals 30%=x[(current success %)*questions currently covered+(required additional attempts)]or y[(.60)(70)+(additional necessary)]((40+(next available opportunities))]y=[26] [40]=n; n\u2248three forty three so rounded up one fourty six becomes .

        "*0.6=<<70*0.6=42>>42 questions answered correctly. Since both tests together make up all her answers this would mean Audrey needed 70+40= <<70+40=110>>110 question(s) overall (a combined sample space). Therefore, because she wants to achieve something above what was asked when taking these exams; audrey just calculated as if she wanted only exactly  70%. However since we see clearly before hand that it takes less than precisely enough so let\u2019s recalculate knowing she made part way toward getting over half of everything yet still required additional work beyond pure cut-off point calculations even though perhaps not being entirely precise. First calculate using previous information :total_correctly_answered==(questions[first]+percentage[second]*testlength):=(70)+(.7*(40))=(70+(.7)*40)=(70+(28))=(98);therefore subtract our result found earlier minus known fact based upon testing performance thus far:(needed_additional_to_move)=expected-(current)=((total/numberoftests)-answerexpected)(needed)->\r",

We know it equals the sum of Audrey\u2019s current score plus what we want as \u2018X': X+42=Y/5 because every question counts half; since both percentages would add up into one fractional piece out of ten parts. And finally multiply everything together when dealing with percents like fractions too!

Number of incorrect answered per paper can not exceed than the available papers means as long as any question remains it becomes obligatory but if no possible ways remain which case cant happen here because even though audrey fails once still its necessary for her too attempt every single thing while moving forward towards progression .
