D+ O+ ST=105 Total Members Define your variables representing what you want. Let us define \u2018x\u2019 represents all Defensive Team Players, 'y' identifies those who played on the Offense line while z represents their peers working within the Unit based out Special Teams Assign ratios amongst the different numbers present using mathematical notation. As such; y/o = 2d hence o = dy which means it can alternatively take its place throughout the remainder of our equation. At this point I recommend adding these new terms into context along side any remaining information available so far\u2026 Doing exactly just mentioned let say..We know following : \u2026...we also get\u2026 .and if further assumed addition required later down road....one could include either directly replacing known values accordingly OR reevaluation altogether until solution emerges clearly before moving forward To continue one would need additional data points regarding quantities being compared herein Example might involve having specific amounts provided relating specifically towards quantity changes among various sections thereby allowing substitution back again afterwards when needed during solving phase Completing steps previously described leads too simple conclusion without sufficient details nor guidance upon exact processes involved However even starting alone already presents complexities requiring logical thinking skills paired wih proper attention detail orientated approach One possible scenario potentially fits somewhat logically beneath above conditions whilst providing necessary hints toward valid reasoning methodologies Below presented below example assumes few assumptions about numerical relationships not specified otherwise thus seeking clarity possibly enhancing understanding next time approaching similar challenge Assuming unknown individual count remains constant over period examined except identified increments per section Change defending lines increases simultaneously causing decrease correspondingly Nonetheless maintain balance ensuring consistency across calculations Keep careful track record keeping systematically Accountable account handling proves immensely crucial Ensure accuracy maintained Despite potential errors discovered unexpectedly Always revisit original statements assess relevance Validate logic applies accurately Conclusive results obtained via diligent thorough efforts Seek feedback verifying appropriateness applied Methodology adopted Follow instructions cautiously Remember practice makes perfect Review process carefully Recheck entries whenever doubt arises Double check calculation prior confirm outcome Finalize findings Only proceed once confidence achieved Equivalent expressions used represent actual representation Therefore concluding expression equalling zero confirms no discrepancy Presuming initial ratio was unaltered through observation Possibly considering hypothetical situations affecting future progress Given incomplete dataset cannot",

        " of players on the defense (let this be denoted by D) by 2 to calculate OFFENSE PLAYERS COUNTED AS TWICE THE DEFENSE BALANCE => OFD= 2*deficit balance ie; Offence=(Off_Balance)+Defend Balance ie.; Defendance+Ofd+=total Players Count=> Ofd/D=TotalPlayers/(D+(OFD)) Totalplayers here we mean our all playerCount which contains defensive ,offensive & others thus other counts need not consider while calculating defend equation only let them considered henceforth(Other plays excluding OtherPlaysExcluudingSpecialTeams i.e., SpecialTeams). We can therefore express it like:(1)(OFF_balance)=DEFEND AND ((TOTPLAYR)-SPTHEETMS-(SPTDUMMYMGYSN)){i.e.}[(specialTeam)*SPC]+[((othersPLACEMENT*)*(otherPlaceMPlacement])]/[DEFBAL]=ALL PLACE MENTES SUM   .wherein ; SPc&othernplcespn>=zero noreferstoanyconditions exceptong those mentionedintheinitialstatementsofthisqoute :{IntheaboveequationsallrepresentsomevaluesnobieyondourcontrolbutwecanusethespecifiedrelationshipbtweenthenumberofindividualselementsinplacebynameINASFORMULAISTHIMLetusnowbriefwhatare\"spdcandospndmmyssnswbc\":\"HereSpdummymsisbeignotedasSOptimalPerformanceDimensionsToaccountForAnyUnconceivedGameFeaturesthatcouldimprovenowherewhilesettingupModelParametersorAssignmentVectorsWhichCombineWithEachIndividualPlayerAbilitiesAndSkillsAsTheyAppearFromReputationalDatasourceOrElseWhereBasedONRealWorldMatchDataUsageLetsUsAlsoNoteThatNoTwoEquivalentConceptSeemedStatedByUsersAtAMatchEventButInsteadVariablesMayHaveBeenThoughtUpofficialNamesAlteringInitialDescriptionsSoNowletslookateachformulaPartSpecific:{Sp=\"Numberofplacementsconsideredspecialteampositionsthuspectivelycomprisingbothactualplayerpermanentpostassignmentsamongwhicheventhederespottedsubtypes",
        " amount which would equal the sum of all players (offense plus defense). Therefore it can be formulated like this: Defense*X*(Defence+Offense)+Special Teams=Total Players Total Offense=(2)(defenses) or 2D Special Teams=(\u00bd)*(defenders)=SD We also know that D+(2d)+(sd) = 105 But we already figured SD = sd because every player only belongs once so let\u2019s remove/combine them first It becomes clear when solved using substitution methodology. Substitute \u2018special teams players\u2018 into equation \u2013 >  \u201cdefensors\u201d+\u201cdouble defenstoqrs\u201d=(total playes)-\"half times depefnsor\")-> Depenents + Double dependents \u2212 Half Dependants = Total players -> Solving equations result \u2192 Doube dependent group\u2192Dependecies equals twenty four! As our double dependency was used up fully therefore remaining thirty one depends upon others hence Final calculation being made below : Number of dependences \u00d7two\u00d7Number of doubles minus half the no..Of dependence totals\u2026And finally ,this comes together resulting to twentytwo players \u2026So here goes my solution if you want different approach I am happy to explain it but yes,,your calculated option Twenty Four stands correct !!!!!! Great job\ud83d\udc4f\u2600\ufe0fYou could use algebra too just needed understanding concepts :) Thanks @Math Guy "
