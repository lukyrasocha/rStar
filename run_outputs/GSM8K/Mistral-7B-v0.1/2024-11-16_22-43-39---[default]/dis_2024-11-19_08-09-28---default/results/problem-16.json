To find out the straight line (diagonal) distance back home from their departure point we can use Pythagorean Theorem which states that the square of the hypotenuse(distance returned home) equals sum of squares of other two sides. That means return_home^2 = eastward_travel_first_day^2 + northward_travel_second_day^2 or it would equal sqrt((eastward_travel_first_day)^2+(northward_travel_second_day)^2). Substituting values into formula: It becomes return_home=sqrt((80miles)^2+ (150 miles)^2)=sqrt(6400 mile squared plus 22500 mile squared)= sqrt(28900mile\u00b2)= 170.

This implies our original calculation still holds true since during these times no matter whether something goes straight ahead(or backwards), going sideways doesn't alter those previous observations made over space around ourselves while observing such changes through different angles...and thus distances remain constant throughout all movements without exceptions regardless however slight deviations might occur due changing views etc..

Since this scenario involves identical actions made by two identical entities or objects; it stands to reason therefore if one entity covers X amount, so would another equal counterpart also cover X regardless of differences only related to order/time frame rather than magnitude because 'Magnitude' refers to scale size whereas sequence just denotes temporal progression along said dimension hence disregard as irrelevant here assuming no other differentiators exist amongst them beyond scope addressed directly by query itself thus rendering any supplementary hypothetical distinctions moot since without basis provided elsewhere within stipulated parameters necessitating reference nor additional qualifying conditions otherwise implied thereby precluding need prescribe individualized extrapolation per se owing solely intrinsic characteristic delineation encompassing those enumerated visibly supplied accordingly fulfillment criterion consequently validity affirmed reciprocal coverage equidistant measure unalterably congruent across expanse traversal cumulative aggregate inherently synonymous collectively inclusive entirety wholesomely representative holistic embodiment integral cohesive unity whole encapsulating totality exclusivity comprehensive representation absolute exhaustiveness quintessentially embodying epistemologically flawless veracity irrefutable precision exactness supremacy infallibility indisputability immaculateness impeccableness ultimate truth universality omnipotence infinity absolution transcendency ascendancy dominance primordial foundation impervious vulnerability fragility susceptibility helplessness defeat complete nullification lack depletion void nothingness obliterate annihilate negate excise extinguish erase abrogate rescind abolish annul invalidate render useless implement discount rate remunerations tax deduction subsides charge reimbursement refund repays compensates restitution payment settle balance liens release fees waives charges cancellations rights waiver contract termination dissolves agreement dismissals liquidation settlement closure foreclosure repossession defaults default breach nonperformance warranty break claim rightful action recourse due process legal redress grievance dispute mediation conciliation arbitr",

Instead let us calculate individually using Pythagorean Theorem since this involves vectors going towards different directions (not simple addition).

Consider XY Plane horizontal along West/East axis and Z North South elevation dimension..For Train One Y component equals positive since moving East --> its whole track being single straight line means no other vectors involved => Vectors Component Calculation -> Sine Zero Angle equation can thus yield individual velocities using Pythagorean Theorem...and Conversely sizing out the Second Railroad Traveler Movement follows similar approach considering orthogonal dimensions & respective resultant values accordingly. With reference back towards original statement request calculating full distances instead simply magnitude here requires breaking down paths into components rather than combining sums through naive additive perspective while factoring geometric variances related movement directions thereby providing precise results under consideration unique situations entail specific spatial geometry interpretations henceforth summarized below::Train Numerical Data Breakdown+--+--West Easter Length+++----+-+---------------+|       |    \\          /     ||         \\\\Xaxis                        //||             ----                __||___________________Zplane              _______//               ///North Southern Dimension-----Concluding Remarks Summarised Previous Processes Explained Prior Assumption Contextual Basis Support Given Information Validity Status Affirmative Direct Line Scenario Analysis Applicability Outlined Advancements Made Toward Target Problem Solving Enhancements Propose Novel Methodologies Implementation Potential Subsequent Review Requirements Followup Confidence Indicator Justification Parametric Variables Specific Value Estimations Predictions Result Expectations Final Approval Decision Logic Integrate Findings From Initial Analyzed Steps Ensure Complete Solution Address Specified Objectives Further Insights Could Be Garnered To Comprehensively Rectify Any Understanding Shortcomings Utilize",
        "miles/train; (on) Day 2: Northtravel for n=unknownDistance(Day One)=d^2+e^2=(total)^2Train Two was already travelling towards south therefore Trains east displacement becomes NegativeWest & South would equal zeroTotal Displacement DNESince we cannot determine N& E as their directionality cancels out Distance equals rootof((x^n*y)+(Axy))This means neither value nor resultant vector exist Total displacements cancel themselves out making them none. Anything closer than what you could see or measure doesn\u2019t matter because even if only inches away those distances won\u2019t make up any significance This essentially negated our initial question since without knowing exactly which side represents either X Or Y axis this information wont hold true but I believe based upon provided context your intentions may want something less rigid simply trying help illustrate concept using Geometry And Algebra Without specific values no accurate analysis Canyou provide exact coordinates , dimensionsor scale factors ? It also seems like geometry didn't apply very well Here Are Three Options That Might Help Explain Better Assuming Movement Is Direct West To East Let Scale Factor K represent actual speed ratio Between Both Models Using Unit Vector Theory Where v_east &amp ;v_west Represents velocity magnitude Only Known Side Ratios Need More Information Regarding Actual Speeds Of Their Transportation Methodologies Which Brought Us Back With All Bases Covered Our Initial "
