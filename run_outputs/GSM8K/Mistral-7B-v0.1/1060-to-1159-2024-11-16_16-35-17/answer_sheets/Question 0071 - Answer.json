{"id": 1131, "problem": "John cuts down an 80-foot tree.  He can make logs out of 80% of it. He cuts it into 4-foot logs.  From each of those logs, he cuts 5 planks.  He then sells each plank for $1.2.  How much does he make?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "He can use 80*.8=<<80*.8=64>>64 feet of the tree.\nThat means he can make 64/4=<<64/4=16>>16 logs.\nThat gives him16*5=<<16*5=80>>80 planks.\nSo he makes 80*1.2=$<<80*1.2=96>>96.\n#### 96", "gold_answer": "96"}
