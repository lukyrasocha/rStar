{"id": 1096, "problem": "Billy is volunteering his time to help people do their taxes. He can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day. If he takes 20% of the days between March 1st and April 19th off, and helps people on all the other days. How many people does he help? (Remember there are 31 days in March.)", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "First find the number of days between March 1st and April 19th: 31 days + 19 days = <<31+19=50>>50 days\nThen subtract the percentage of time Billy takes off from 100% to find the percentage of time he works: 100% - 20% = 80%\nThen multiply that number by 80% to find the number of days Billy works: 50 days * 80% = <<50*80*.01=40>>40 days\nThen find how many people Billy can help per day: 2 people/hour * 3 hours/day = <<2*3=6>>6 people/day\nThen multiply the number of people he helps per day by the number of days he works to find the total number of people he helps: 6 people/day * 40 days = <<6*40=240>>240 people\n#### 240", "gold_answer": "240"}
