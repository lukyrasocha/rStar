{"id": 1092, "problem": "A Tyrannosaurus rex ate half of a small triceratops it had hunted. When it left, a pack of velociraptors scavenged half of what was left. A group of lazy Allosaurus gulped down the last 270 kilograms of meat. How many kilograms of meat were on the triceratops before the T-Rex ate?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "The velociraptors left half for the Allosaurus, so the T-Rex left 2 * 270 = <<2*270=540>>540 kilograms of meat.\nThe T-Rex ate half the meat, so there were 540 * 2 = <<540*2=1080>>1080 kilograms of meat on the triceratops.\n#### 1080", "gold_answer": "1080"}
