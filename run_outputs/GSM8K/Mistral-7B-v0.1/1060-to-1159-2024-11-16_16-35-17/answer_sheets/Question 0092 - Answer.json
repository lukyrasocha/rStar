{"id": 1152, "problem": "Mark buys one lottery ticket with a 20% chance of winning and a second lottery ticket that's three times more likely to win. What is the probability, expressed as a percentage, that both tickets are winners?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "First triple 20% to find the second ticket's chance of winning: .2 * 3 = <<.2*3=.6>>.6\nThen multiply both tickets' chances of winning to find the probability they both win, and multiply that by 100 to convert it to a percentage: .6 * .2 * 100% = 12%\n#### 12", "gold_answer": "12"}
