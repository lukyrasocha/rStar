{"id": 1095, "problem": "If two trains depart from a station in opposite directions, and one train is traveling 60 miles an hour while the other is traveling half that distance per hour, how far apart are they from each other after 3 hours?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "Since one train is traveling half the speed of the train traveling 60 miles an hour, that means that train is traveling 60/2= <<60/2=30>>30 miles an hour.\nTherefore, to find the distance traveled each hour in total we add both trains' speed together for a total of 60+30=<<90=90>>90 miles traveled each hour.\nThis means that in 3 hours they will have traveled 90*3= <<90*3=270>>270 miles away from each other.\n#### 270", "gold_answer": "270"}
