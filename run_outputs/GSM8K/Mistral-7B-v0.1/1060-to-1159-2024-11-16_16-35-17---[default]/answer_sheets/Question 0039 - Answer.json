{"id": 1099, "problem": "The biggest waterslide at Five Flags is 300 feet long, and people slide down at 60 feet/minute. The second biggest waterslide is 240 feet long, but steeper, so people slide down at 80 feet/minute. How much longer does it take to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "First find the ride length of the biggest slide: 300 feet / 60 feet/minute = <<300/60=5>>5 minutes\nThen find the ride length of the second biggest slide: 240 feet / 80 feet/minute = <<240/80=3>>3 minutes\nThen subtract the ride length of the second longest slide from the longest slide to find the difference: 5 minutes - 3 minutes = <<5-3=2>>2 minutes\n#### 2", "gold_answer": "2"}
