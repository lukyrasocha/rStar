{"id": 1066, "problem": "The glee club ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them. The football team ordered twice as many pizzas and ate 80% of them. How many pizzas are left?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "First find the percentage of pizzas left from the glee club: 100% - 70% = 30%\nThen multiply that percentage by the number of pizzas the glee club ordered to find the number of pizzas left: 30% * 20 pizzas = <<30*.01*20=6>>6 pizzas\nThen multiply the number of pizzas the glee club ordered by 2 to find the number the football team ordered: 20 pizzas * 2 = <<20*2=40>>40 pizzas\nThen find the percentage of pizzas left from the football team: 100% - 80% = 20%\nThen multiply that percentage by the number of pizzas the football team ordered to find the number of pizzas left: 20% * 40 pizzas = <<20*.01*40=8>>8 pizzas\nThen add the number of pizzas left from each group to find the total number left: 8 pizzas + 6 pizzas = <<8+6=14>>14 pizzas\n#### 14", "gold_answer": "14"}
