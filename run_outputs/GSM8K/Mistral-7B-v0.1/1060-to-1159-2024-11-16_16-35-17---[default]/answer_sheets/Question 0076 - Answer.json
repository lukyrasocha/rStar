{"id": 1136, "problem": "Bob has a certain number of marbles. If he receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. If he loses 10 of the marbles he has, how many marbles will Bob have?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "Let B be the number of marbles Bob starts with.\n2 dozen marbles is 2 * 12 = <<2*12=24>>24 marbles.\nSo after receiving 2 dozen more marbles, we know B + 24 = 60.\nThis means B = 60 - 24 = <<60-24=36>>36.\nBob ends with 36 - 10 = <<36-10=26>>26 marbles.\n#### 26", "gold_answer": "26"}
