Half of 100 is 50. So Luis had 50. Luis used half of the 50 and gave the rest to Kris. Half of 50 is 25. So Luis used 25 and Kris had 25. Kris kept 9 stickers and gave the rest to Rob. This leaves us with 9 out of the original 25, so 9 + 25 = 34 stickers are left.

Seth has a certain number of stickers initially. Then, he gives half of them to Luis. This reduces the number of stickers he has by half. Luis uses half of these stickers and gives the rest to Kris. This further reduces the number of stickers that Seth has. Finally, Kris keeps 9 stickers and gives the remaining 7 stickers to Rob. This leaves Seth with a certain number of stickers. To find out how many stickers Seth had initially, we need to go through all the steps and reverse them. We can start by adding back the 7 stickers that Rob received, and then add back the 9 stickers that Kris kept. This will give us the number of stickers that Luis received from Seth. We can then multiply this number by 2 to get the number of stickers that Seth had initially.", "value": 0.125}}}, "rollout_id": 28}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis.
