First, we have the first condition, which tells us that 3 miles of walking consists of 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk. This means that 2/3 of the walk is on the beach, and 1/3 of the walk is on the sidewalk. Next, we have the second condition, which tells us that on the beach, Grandma walks at a slower pace compared to the sidewalk. This means that the time it takes to walk on the beach will be longer than the time it takes to walk on the sidewalk. Finally, we have the third condition, which tells us that the portion of time spent on the beach is equal to 40 minutes. This means that 40 minutes out of the entire walk was spent on the beach. To calculate the total amount of time it took for Grandma to finish the full 3-mile walk, we need to add together the time it took to walk on the beach and the time it took to walk on the sidewalk. Since 2/3 of the walk was on the beach and 1/3 of the walk was on the sidewalk, we can use the following equation to find the total time: `time_on_beach / (2/3) + time_on_sidewalk / (1/3) = 40` Rearranging this equation, we get: `time_on_beach = 40 * (2/3) - time_on_sidewalk * (1/3)`. Since the third condition tells us that `time_on_beach = 40`, we can substitute this into the equation to solve for `time_on_sidewalk`: `40 = 40 * (2/3) - time_on_sidewalk * (1/3)` `40 = 2 * 40 * (1/3) - time_on_sidewalk * (1/3)` `40 = 80 - time_on_sidewalk` `-80 = -80 - time_on_sidewalk` `time_on_sidewalk = 80` Thus, the total amount of time it took for Grandma to finish the full 3-mile walk was `40 + 80 = 120` minutes, or 2 hours.
