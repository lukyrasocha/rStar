Adding these quantities together results in(cost_of_uniform+hat)= ($50+ 2* $25 )=(cost of uniform)+($(cost of jacket)-$75)(price difference due totwo sameitems). From algebra notation:- let variable X represent \"$unifrom\"->X+(X-$75)$=$ $(cost of uniform)$. Using basic algebraic simplification techniques here such as combining like terms lets us isolate what constitutes either side into simple variables.-first add coefficients [i.e,(x+$-75)] ->result => (-$75))*(simplified form)->multiplying across shows multiplication takes precedence over addition or subtraction.)Now solve equation abovefor unknown values:\"-(75)*(\"(unknown value)\" +(-$75)).

Since pants price equals their mean value \u2014 1/2*(hat+jacket), this means ((100)/2)=<<(100)/2=50>>50 dollars , thus making one whole set worth precisely ($25+$75+$50)==$150 overall.. The answer is: 150.",
        " = $<<3*25=75>>75. To get the average price of the hat and the jacket we add their prices together (i.e., $25 + $75) resulting into $100. Since it says this equals half the overall expense, simply multiply both sides of equation above by 2 which results in ($100)*(2)=$200 being spent altogether for all four items \u2013 namely; the coat , cap & trousers combined . It follows accordingly however you would split this amount equally amongst everyone involved/participating thus coming up wtih : Total Cost per Uniform=Total Overall Expenditure/(number Of Students Wearing These Attire)=($200)/4=$<<200/4=50>>50 Per Student ; Bottom Line ",
        " of the hat (25) and jacket prices ((25+75)/2). Therefore it would come out to being $(50/2)= 25$ dollars per pair of jeans or pants . To find what the entire ensemble would cost we sum all these amounts together which yields  75(jackets)+ 25(hats)+ 25= \\$125",

Therefore, the hats and jackets together retail for twice this amount \\((2*100=200)\\) or doubled since we counted them separately rather than adding up all four clothing items. Thus it stands alone unchanged that one pair of jeans still sells for \\(\\frac{200}{2}=100\\) dollars .

        " so it would cost 25 * 3 which equals to 75. Therefore, you add up these amounts together (with addition), i.e., we get (the sum)  25+ 75= 100. Since both items (jacket & hat) share similar weights; therefore the price per item can simply divided across them equally like dividing their combined value by two ($(25 + 75)/2$), resulting into ((100)/2)=$50. Lastly since this pair only consists one type (\"each\") of clothing including jacket plus its equal part hat makes half unit or $(50/2)$, meaning what was found earlier. Hence, every single component\u2019s worth sums up to ($((25)+(75))/$2$, making your grand result equivalent to either halving it twice or multiplying again by $\\frac {1}{2}$ because when you multiply everything together yields another set $(\\{({(\\frac {25} \\times {\\frac {75}})}{\\frac {1}{2}}\\})^\\frac {1}{2}=({\\sqrt{{{({\\frac {25*75}})}{\\frac {1}{4}}}}}))={\\sqrt{({{\\left[{{(\\frac {25}{4}\\right)}}]^{\\frac {1}{2}}}})\\cdot {{{\\left[{{(\\frac {75}{4}\\right)}}]^{-\\frac {1}{2}}}}}}}$, consequently equating thusly simplifies down all values further towards finding out ${(\\frac {{{{1}^2}}^*{\\frac {1}{2}}}*{{\\frac {3^2}}^*\\frac {-1}{2}})}$ henceforth being simplified even lower unto ultimately acquiring our desired outcome ,resultantly representing the required computation .

        " = $75.

To know the price of one pair of jeans alone, divide this sum by $x$, which means dividing it into 2 equal parts because jeans make pairs according to the statement above since neither numbers nor their meanings cancel other(it doesn't say anything like just 'number', etc.) Therefore ($25+$75)/2 equals $100/2=($50), meaning its $. But if you try putting any reasonable value below .5 cents here (.5*cents=.5 cents)=less than half penny , none add upto yet another whole dollar hence only when I used exact figures no math operations such as fraction reductions involving fractions occurred, instead division was involved implying single values unlike expressions resulting upon using variables thereby necessitating multiplication due not lack but deliberate absence prior knowledge leading towards unintended misconception thus requiring subsequent explanation explaining why multiplicative action precedes arithmetical operation although seemingly intuitively erroneous without full conceptual understanding behind basic principles forming foundation integral skills required across disciplines learning mathematics proves particularly challenging especially absent context providing deeper insight beyond superficially graspable surface level information furthermore addition requires subtraction whereas subtraction inherently involves negative outcome yielding zero remainder despite initial expectation otherwise causing confusion amongst novices attempting tackle subject matter therefore additional clarification necessary following detailed elucidation concerning fundamental concepts underlying arithmetic operations explained utilizing illustrations simple examples coupled real life applications encompass scenarios commonplace encountered daily emphasizing pertinent relevance relatable everyday experiences promoting comprehension through practical application solidifying theoretical underpinnings reinforcing critical thinking abilities essential skillset paramount fostering lifelong curiosity driving pursuit acquisition mastery excellence education achievement academic success personal growth career opportunity advancement professional competitive edge advantage leadership potential charisma persuasive communication prowess influence motivational drive effective decision making strategic planning resourcefulness innovation creativity ingenuity entrepreneurship economic prosperity financial security independence autonomy self reliance empowerment equanimity emotional stability wellbeing mental health physical fitness optimal functionality optimum productivity efficiency output quality service standards satisfaction customer experience exceptional performance overall",

To find this amount add together their individual prices and divide them into half because if something averages its values you take sum of those things divided by count(number). (Sum) / (count) means [(Cost of Hat + Cost of Jacket)] / 2 which translates mathematically to ($25 + $75)/ 2 equals 100/2 or equaling $50. Total up all four items listed above.
