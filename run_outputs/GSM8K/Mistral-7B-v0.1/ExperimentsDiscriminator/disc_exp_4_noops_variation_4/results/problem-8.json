With those relationships established along side another equation representing all three groups together \u2013 Offense +Defence+Special_team(that makes up Total Team Members), Let us put them into variables within equations: **D + O + S =T** , Where T stands for the entire count per group ie (**Offense','Defense', 'Special')which sums upto All Groupings Equivalent (=Total).
