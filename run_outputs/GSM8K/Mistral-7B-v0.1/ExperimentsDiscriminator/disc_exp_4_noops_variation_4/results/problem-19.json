This results into (5*10) or 50 additional minutes needed when applying these paints than what was normally required with older products already established within industry standards. Therefore you can conclude if asked something like 'how long does application procedure exceed regular benchmark procedures?' my interpretation could lead me to say roughly approximately 50% over due consideration about normality being referenced under previous conditions while adhering strictly towards comparative analysis based merely upon factual evidence collected regarding said question itself rather any formulating generalization outside scope specified herein without clear directive otherwise provided contextually encompass entirety discussed thereby facilitating unbiased decision making approach ensuring fairness preservation amongst involved parties concerned equally sharing input prior determining outcome aimed achieving objective desired pursuing ultimate success sought attainable feasible reaching agreed mutually beneficial consensus eventually realized satisfactorily aligning expectations harmoniously achieved objectives optimally maximizing potential fully leveraging opportunities present seamlessly coordinated effort efficiently utilized resourcefully judiciously executed aptly implemented expertly performed skillful craft mastered proficient learned through experience gained wisdom garnered understanding cultivated insights derived knowledge amass acquired abilities honed developed talents nurtured creativity blossomed realised innovation harvested prosperity reaped achievement earned merits well deserved celebrated acclaimed esteemed respect afforded acknowledged appreciated valued cherished savored enjoyed relished treasured experienced reward worthwhile fulfilled gratifying satisfying accomplishment accomplished successfully completed productively carried out diligently handled effectively tackled systematically processed methodically organised neatly arranged properly functioned worked hardened improved refined polished upgraded augmented optimized streamlined automated digitalised modernized transformed revolutionised reinvented revitalised renaissance period culminating happily everafter henceforth forevermore commemorated perpetuated remembered conserved preserved protected saved secured safeguarded fortified strengthened sustained maintained renewed restored recovered reclaimed retrieved resurrected salvaged recuper",

Hence this problem revolves around conversion and comparison rather traditional subtraction leading us towards understanding 'comparison & difference calculations'.

Hence, extended exposure equals(new_time*number_of_surfaces)-(old_time*number_of_surfaces).
