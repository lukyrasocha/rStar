Assuming those hourly driving durations as full units towards covering their respective segments of distances during every individual trip segment respectively.

To simplify matters further , however perhaps splitting entire journeys down intervals allows better analysis rather calculating specific percentages across various segments simultaneously ; additionallly helping mitigate similar discrepancies caused earlier described alongside their respective influence upon estimators despite underlying patterns forming distinct trends once considered individually ??? Furthermore why bother getting involved without knowing exact values concerning certain parameters ahead especially ones related directly towards obtaining estimates ultimately leading us onto misjudgements regarding accuracy vs precision concepts commonly debated amongst professionals seeking accurate assessment methods hence achieving maximum reliability through implementation processes designed specifically address common pitfalls present among layman practitioners attempting personal projects independently although admitted difficulties still exist regardless technical knowledge possessed prior undertakings..

As such, substitute values yielding [3600/(6000)]*(100%) resulting ultimately as ((3600/6000)*100), simplifying further down obtaining approximately equal to 60%.
