Ready when you are \u2013 let me walk through these calculations again using division only without resorting directly to multiplication by finding equivalent whole numbers. We start off knowing that there are 40 students in our school scenario.

Total number if someone prefers something outlined i.e., except pink being equal to Blue+Green+Yellow combinations adding up as follows; [Blue(A)=20 ]+(green)(B)+[yellow](C).

Finally identify those interested in Yellow using subtraction method again; since there are totally four quadrants i.e., Blue, Green,Yellow and No Interest/Other Colors Total Pupil Count which equals 40 but Number Subtract every non-yellow category yields results so doing calculation  40-(Blue+Green)=Number Interested in Yellow & no other colors Given information about Glassy eyes : It seems not necessary because Color Preference doesn\u2019t require any connection or understanding related towards Vision Status \u2013 Therefore Disregard Information regarding eyewear details when calculating yellows ones Only focus numbers As our previous calculations shows That \u2018Remaining\u201d Group Post Non-blue categorization , equaled upto 20 Here further dividing into quarterly group We Have determined earlier that among \u2019Remainders', quarter amount prefer Green hence leaving others favorable toward Yellow Hence ",
