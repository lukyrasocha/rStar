Thus, if we imagine putting these jobs onto different timelines like 'timeJob', you would get {'timeline': [('jobK', 'hours'), ('groupT', 'hrs')], ...} but considering every single task equally independent because none could assist another immediately here, simply compute TimetakenInHrsForEachSingleGroupTask or Task -> TortoiseSpeed times TimeWorkOfFirstThreeKanjaros divided up among them accordingly.
