        " implies those being referred might represent only one category (shoplifters). Thus it means no additional numbers need subtracting or adding as all categories (refusal to wear masks, shoplifting, violent acts) can directly add up without requiring deductions beyond their direct addition. Add them together; we get 3 (mask offenders) + 7 (shoplifters) + 21 (violent act participants), which sums up exactly to 31 accountable individuals when looking strictly within these three groups. As per information available, if totals count towards overall expulsion doesn\u2019t include 'other', so deduct this summed group value from our broader base amount mentioned i.e., 50, resulting therefore into 19 remaining unknown/extra figures representing miscellaneous violations including but not exclusive examples like arguing amongst shoppers etc., trespassings outside premises boundaries possibly even accident prone slips occurrences underpinned unidentifiable sections considering exclusivity of scenarios laid emphasizing singularity principle applicable herein contextually based upon provided documentary specifics.
