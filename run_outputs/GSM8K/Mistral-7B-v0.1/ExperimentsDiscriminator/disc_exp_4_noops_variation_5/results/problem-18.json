To know what percentage this accounts out of all the problems (both tests combined), we calculate overall problem count as  70+40=<<70+40=110>>110 issues altogether .

Solving such system yields Y ~ 38. Therefore Audrey would require about three figures close to 38 additional responses accurate. As students normally can only opt exact integers I suggest choosing either 38, since it exceeds requisites while remaining attainable underneath real life situations; or you could pick any value around it say one less than perfect i..e .. if your not inclined towards rounding down : (increase integer amount slightly ) eg ... choose , perhaps... ;if desiring closer proximity yet still below optimal threshold ....then maybe select something like plus (+5) instead ie increase y by just enough margin above requirements but well beneath ideal mark \u2026i mean don\u2019t go crazy!

        " this as being '70%' or (in decimal form) .7. Next determine the total amount of points possible across both exams. This equals 70+40=110 points/questions. Calculate what these would translate into out of ten percent; thus multiplying it times ten yields our target score : (.7)(110*10)=770%. Convert audrey\u2019s performance so far on the test over to raw countable results using similar steps we already used above: multiply totals again [and subtract since those aren\u2019t available] ((.6)(70)+total_remaining). From here simplify until you isolate your variable question mark X which represents remaining answers required , yielding (-X=(-.7)*(Total Available)-(.6)*(already_correct)). Therefore combine like terms and solve numerically ; finally divide result through negative one if needed. Substituting known values back into derived equation renders us :-x=[-(negative .7),(calculated sum)_of all availible questions,-.(multiplied valueforpercentanswercorret)]=>=-[(-.7)*.110,(add calculated numbers together),-+.42].
