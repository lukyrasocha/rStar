Accordingly, multiplying these twelve consecutive hours using Johnson\u2019s stated velocity i.e., forty-five miles for every passing minute comes out to amount precisely sixty hundredth mile segments which when expressed numerically translates to three point zero four thousand feet. Consequently deducing further analysis would consequently reveal him having traversed just beneath thirty percent [(3,040/4,000)%] towards accomplishing complete trip within specified parameters hence resulting value being approximated close but not exactly reaching forthcoming ninety (x).
