This information reveals it takes around 4 hours daily per dog because every single one requires this amount of attention.. Next, calculate overall daily commitment required. To obtain this figure multiply found individual figures : 4*4=<<4*4=16>>16 hours . Conclude the result as such : Based upon calculation above , we can conclude that based off data provided,thomas spends roughly about '16' hrs doing maintenance duties /per day while being responsible for them!. Lastly find out entire Week Hours; Since all actions happened over consecutive weeks therefore multiplying calculated values times seven would provide accurate results hence  16hrsx7days equals <<16*7=112>>112 hour(approximately) !

Since this occurs thrice over seven consecutive days during normal circumstances such those occurring within regular work weeks not spanning full months or multiple leap years , you\u2019ll need therefore calculate 8*3 which yields twenty six hence making it clear only considering usual non extended periods like routine workweeks would suggest .
