We know one cookie contains around 67 calories so all those goodies equal up to about 42 * 67 = 2814 calories or approximately ~2,814 Kcal in sum.

To figure out this problem, all you need to know how many fewer or more items one person used compared to another\u2014in our case, different food intake measured via their respective numbers representing them physically/nutritional consumption. From my calculation above ,we find no matter what differences exist within people themselves when considering energy usage versus weight gain etc., ultimately everything boils down back into understanding simple arithmetic processes such \u2018subtraction,\u2019 because every single mathematical operation involves these most basic steps regardless whether dealing primarily logical deductions based upon scientific principles being studied during advanced academics like Calculus II classes taught across universities globally . Which helps prove why math still reign supreme despite living under nebulous clouds surrounded mostly filled full time jobs requiring extensive hours dedication over long periods resulting eventually becoming exhausted mentality leading others away towards less academic pursuits hoping finding solace elsewhere instead perhaps getting involved romantically attached relationships aimlessly thinking nothing else truly exists beyond immediate emotions feelings sensations experienced momentarily until dissipated later leaving vacuum behind never again feeling same excitement joy happiness ever encountered once prior previously assumed reality perceived world outside suddenly transformed appearing strange even surreal almost alien non-physical entities residing inside head space existing unnoticed till brought forth through conscious awareness caused often triggered indirectly due underlying factors relating personal behaviors traits mannerisms choices made daily actions performed repetitively causing further discomfort physical manifesting internal struggles forming core foundation rooted deep ingrained condition embedded onto soul itself affecting behavior driving thought process influencing perspectives shaping overall existence impacting decision making thus determining outcome achieved result manifested either positive negative neutral neither way preferred desired intended desires wishes aspirations dream goals ambitions achievements success failures disappointments regret remorse unhappiness misery suffering sorrow sadness grief anxiety fear nervousness panic worry worried uneasyness concern stress strained muscles tighten jaw clench fingers pounding heart racing breath",
