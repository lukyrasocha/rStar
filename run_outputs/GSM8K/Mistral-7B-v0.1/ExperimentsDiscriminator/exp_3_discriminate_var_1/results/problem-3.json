Finally multiply it by 8weeks(the period)to get overall result over these 8 weeks \u2013  31.5*8 => 252 Hours Therefore, during eight consecutive weeks ,he watches television or read books about fifty three point seven fifteen hrs approximately equals almost one hour Fifty four Point Seven Eight Years later when we come back you may find me studying another subject called Physics But still I love my favorite sport Football even though sometimes not good enough but practice keeps us moving forward .!!

Additionally, since he goes to sleep immediately when finished with TV and reads during those newfound free moments (which was stated last time), we can assume it takes him about similar amounts of rest afterwards compared to tv-watching or else not possible. Therefore if you consider both activities together which includes around another quarter hour than previous average duration dedicated towards television, i guess something like ~2hours~ could serve better instead making calculations easier while leaving flexibility intact but still following instruction guideline roughly considering averages already existing herein .

The answer is: 31.5*. This implies you want me multiply these amounts together but just leave your expression so we can verify later without computing further than necessary here because if calculating larger numbers gets computation cost prohibitive or otherwise impractical I might not return immediately thus leaving our equation unsolved yet still providing usable information before any subsequent calculation takes place upon request like say someone wants exact numerical results vs something only simplified numerically based off certain conditions such as what type environment would best compute them due both resource allocation constraints combined wth desired outcome accuracy tolerance margins..

Adding up both types together brings us to thirty-five hours \u2013 twenty-one plus twelve extra ones\u2014of recreational screen use daily for him last week alone!

Adding these together gets us 21+14=35 which means Robert spends approximately 35 hours/perish off tv activity including sleeping during breaks when not working or anything else daily routine but excluding those activities into work life ratio like driving etc).

During eight weeks you need to multiply it ten fourteen forty hours since those periods last exactly one week apart respectively.

Therefore, over eight weeks Robert devotes 224 hrs collectively into both pursuits combined.

We get  2 (TV) + 0(sleep)+ (-/+ No Homework)=     Total    Daily Routine Sum :          It's important not confuse them since their schedules differ quite significantly when you consider different scenarios or settings like staycations versus fuller stays including classes being attended over holiday periods etc., so remember context matters greatly especially if comparing against standard expectations during such events too!!
