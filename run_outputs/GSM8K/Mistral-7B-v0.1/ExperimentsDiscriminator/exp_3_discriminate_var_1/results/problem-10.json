As one fourth wants greens, we multiply this figure i.e., 1/4*12 which equates to three girls wanting red. That leaves us with 12-(1/4*12) equals six kids choosing 'yellow.' Hence, six children want the color Yellow out of a whole twenty four. Therefore, since these numbers make sense when viewed as parts of equal wholes divided among different sections, our conclusion stands validated.

Calculate other parts before calculating any sums including both sides together so no double counting occurs within groupings due simply because numbers might look alike while differing fundamentally behind every unique aspect attributed individually per distinct unit type hence requiring careful analysis without overlooking aspects otherwise perceived trivial considering overall totals may seem accurate however individual counts can shift greatly causing discrepancies leading possibly towards incorrect conclusions when comparing relative versus absolute values involved throughout respective subdivisions across categorical variables linked closely tied yet contrastively separate entities representing various subsets potentially impacting holistic aggregate summarizations significantly depending largely upon precise observations accompanied fully informed understanding aimed primarily toward exactitude rather than approximation rooted deeply firmly grounded amongst myriads complexities embedded meticulously craftily intricately interwoven tightly knit web threads forming collective comprehensive synthesis yielding harmonious unity emerging resplendently radiant amidst illumination thereby shedding profound light dispersing shadows cast previously hiding obscure truth masking itself cunningly exploiting opportunistically wieldable ambiguity skillfully deftness exhibited mastery manipulating delicate balance graceful poise perfect equilibrium enlightenment inspiring visionaries seeking pathways traversing uncharted territories encounter challenges testing boundaries pushing limits breaking new grounds exploring frontiers never imagined venturing ever deeper striving relentlessly pursuing dreams aspiring reaching stars beyond ordinary limitations transcending earthbound confines touching heavens floating weightless sailing starry seas navigating cosmic ocean charting celestial course voyaging galactic odyssey discoveries await those brave intrepid souls driven indomitable spirit fuelled ceaseless passion boundless enthusiasm igniting creative flames spark innovations changing world transforming lives altering destinies rewriting history ushering golden ages epochs eras witness extraordinary tales saga adventures legends immortalized forevermore embodied spirits eternally engraved timeless wisdom passed down generations reverberated echoes resonate voices whisper haunting melodies stirring hearts evoking emot",
