To calculate the amount necessary to achieve seventy per cent overall we use proportions : let X represent the quantity required on the following question set. Thus ,X/(x+Y) equals seven zero points . Y represents fifty because it stands as count while being divided amongst our results so far therefore setting up equation becomes ((48)/(80+(50)))=(70 over 100).
