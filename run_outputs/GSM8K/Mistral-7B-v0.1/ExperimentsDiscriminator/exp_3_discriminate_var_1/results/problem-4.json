To solve this question effectively we need to first determine what portion of the puzzle Mrs. Smith contributes compared to its entirety, focusing specifically on scenarios resulting lesser than fifty percent workload through female inputs alone. From previous information provided it\u2019s clear one fourth or twenty seven hundred eighty four units originated directly because of child effort while another division equaling thirty three sixty six fragments emerges subsequent resultant post interventionist involvement signifying paternal input yet prioritizing situations predominantly dependent females contribution but not exceeding fiftieth fraction criteria specified henceforth calculations entail multiplicative manoeuvres applying respective fractions mentioned earlier stages corresponding components towards overall aggregate quantity thereby deduction method applies subsequently subtract these newly formulated figures accordingly under consideration guidelines established thus derived values reflect accurate state accurately matching requisition conditions highlight demand fulfilment mandate adhere precise measurement standard compliance ensure accuracy benchmark meet exactitude expectations assurance offer utmost precision align closely original request intent observe stringent verification protocol strictly enforce absolute integrity maintain highest levels conformity strictest observance rule enforcements guarantee valid outcome reliably derive conclusive resolution meticulously uphold disciplined approach yield reliable insightful revelation proceed carefully calculate judiciously verify thoroughly cross validate recheck repeatedly corroborate consistently sustain credibility confirm trustworthily produce genuine discovery ultimately affirm truthfully substantiate authentically justify righteousness demonstrate factual competence exhibit expert proficiency manifest distinguished capability showcase superior mastery illustrate exemplary skill display exceptional knowledge apply scholarship prove merits obtain acclaim garner respect achieve recognition seek distinction pursue excellence reach pinnacle aspire lofty goal attain aim high strive hard put forth best efforts never cease endeavor persist push forward keep moving ahead overcome challenge face obstacles rise above limitation transcend barrier breakthrough discover groundbreaking innovation advance frontier expand horizon explore unknown venture fresh start embark enter territory",

This simplifies further because like terms divide out leaving us with` 0 + ((3)(20))/(3\u00d75 \u00d7 5)`. And finally reducing our last term leaves us with` 0 + ((3)(4))/(5^2)`, which evaluates numerically as `0 + (12)/(25)`.

Therefore, only half the remainder would still need placing, as the other half was laid down by their mother. Thus, there are around 4152 / 2 = about 2076 pieces not yet placed onto the board. But since we can\u2019t split pieces here exactly like fractions or decimals apply because it involves physical objects, let's just consider whole numbers hence rounding upwards yields us about **2076** actual piece count missing place holders based purely on calculations; however note this might vary minutely due real world constraints when actually assembling such large sets! The answer is: Approximately 2076. Note though exactness depends upon handling leftovers accurately rather than simple division leading possibly minute differences depending precisely what counts \u201cremaining\u201d. )(This may seem inconsistent initially but remember every individual action affects subsequent actions meaningful changes could happen even minimally altercations).
