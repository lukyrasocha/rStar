To calculate this, you would find out what one third (=1/0.1=~3%) of your original cost would equal, which equals ~$.3 per dollar spent initially so approximately $9 off overall because about .1 times our initial amount amounts totals roughly $3 but still underestimates quite significantly hence approximation works fine here too..
