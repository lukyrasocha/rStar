But since you asked about only four months instead of sixteen full cycles , so taking into account their relative sizes; dividing both terms equally yields:(x)/2=(4)/2=>(x)=8 Overall: John takes up ((x)-3)^n((time)) which equals: eight minus twelve, i.e.:-(four). The result seems like our negative sign indicates excess consumption! As when thinking through what actually happened : When John watched television continuously throughout all seventeen consecutive days included amongst those designated Saturday, Sunday, Wednesday & Thursday ; namely\u2026for Monday, Tuesday& Friday....he also read just once upon arriving back home late...but didn\u2019t even pause afterwards !

Therefore considering precise tracking without resorting solely upon average values leads us closer alignments against totals expressed through simpler arithmetic division applied directly prevalent amongst common estimation methods otherwise leading potential deviations via cumulative marginal discrepancies arising during sequential aggregation periods particularly evident under strict interval demarcations often found intrinsic standardization frameworks used frequently throughout academic study environments emphasizing detailed quantifiable metric comparisons while maintaining robust adherence concerning conventional mathematical protocol dictated principally fundamentally driven paradigmatic oriental educational traditions advocating exactitude thus promulgating systematically structured data interpretative methodologies aiming facilitating meticulously calibrated analytical discourse embodying empirically grounded scientific inquiry principles typifying universally embraced scholarly intellectual pursuits characteristic manifestive benchmark attributes fostering rigorous disciplinary exploratory research endeavors integral pivotal component enabling progressively advancing technologically mediated epistemological construct development processes indispensable catalyzing innovative transformational insights thereby augmenting comprehensive knowledge accumulation conducive vitality nurturing global collective cognitive capabilities further contributing substantive contributions propelling multidisciplinarity centered transdisciplinary collaboration synergistic interactions driving interconnectedness coherently orchestrated integratively designed sophisticated complex adaptive dynamic emergent organization collaborative network strategies ultimately effectuating efficacious sustainably resilient effective governance informed policy shaped responsive regulatory framework operational efficacy optimized resource allocation optimization benefitting mutual wellbeing communality symbiotic reciprocity equilibrium balance coexistence inclusivity diversity harmonious unity holistic approach leveraging whole systems thinking perspective addressing socioecological considerations navigating ethically respectfully recognizant sensitivity awareness culturally diverse perspectives valuing input seeking consensus building dialogue generating shared understanding creating partnerships cultivating trust relations",

However remember not all options might provide exact accuracy according to your question hence justifying Option 'D'.
