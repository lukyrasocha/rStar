To find out how long longer it takes with the new varnish compared to the original time taken with the old varnish, we subtract the initial amount (with the old varnish) from the second scenario (newly applied varnish): 72 minutes \u2013 42 minutes = 30 additional minutes needed when applying new varnish to six paintings.

Therefore, the answer is incorrect based off your solution; my calculated time was instead twentythree (23). Here\u2019s what you need to consider about problem solving like this:- First thing I recommend doing when tackling any math word problems or scenarios involving various situations such as changes made\u2013always list out key points clearly before diving into calculations./For example, here let me outline them quickly:(initial scenario)(change being applied),(total items affected)=>[drying process lasts seven (+/-)time units],[six newly used paintings].([amount increased due])=[old vs current]= [(current)-(original)] /[(quantity multiplied)[number_of items]]='[incremental increase overall]'.From above listing statement,[+/-](new subtract [older]),this means no absolute decrease happens but just rather another rate compared against prior rates thus ensuring values remain positive throughout calculation sequences.- Remember though,'any negative signs attached won't come down until evaluation phase comes later hence keeping track accordingly!' Next remember if working directly wrt quantities increasing without considering initial states yet first sort according set differences:[New minus Old],thereafter proceed sequentiallywith relevant arithmetic operations till arrivingfinal conclusion.(In real life cases perhaps might involve conversions depending upon measurable attributesinvolved.) Thus following procedure precisely yields:'Drying period increments by seventeen units altogether across sixtopitainmentsto ensure proper curative treatment applies.[Original versus Updated Rate Difference]*Total Number Required To Treat Each.=Final Total Amount Expected Outcome Based Upon Comparison Analysis Against Original Factors At Play Within Contextual Constraints Identified During Evaluation Process.). Hence why understanding basic mathematical principles related specifically within contextually bound environments can make critical distinctions regarding impact severity associated towards differnt approaches taken during certain processes executed simultaneously---be conscious those underlying influences while evaluating potential discrepancies arising through said procedures!

Thus calculating such scenarios via multiplication might help you understand better whether or not these small increments really impact cumulative totals greatly enough before moving forward towards practical applications within real world context involving multiple items being processed sequentially under varied circumstances depending upon their respective characteristics; but here instead just look straight away onto numbers themselves without thinking too hard!

That comes out equal to 5 * 6 = 30 hours if we convert both units into mins first but let\u2019s stick with \u2018extra hours.\u2019 Hence the equation becomes ((12min \u2013 7min)*6canvasses)/(60*1hr/min)= .33 hr which equals about half hour so round up since you cannot count part of min due its not complete make sure your answer contains whole numbers.\r",

Therefore if under typical conditions everything went well without any interruptions etc., our calculations imply Susan could save about half an hour overall due mostly being able work through twice every minute instead just once while still managing both tasks simultaneously regardless whether applied separately either together!

        "; therefore, the difference is 12 \u2212 7 = 5 minutes per coat. To find out how much time extra these six paints (each getting only one coat) require when all their layers need simultaneous application instead of sequential ones like before so multiply this value over itself since every layer adds onto top another previously applied base \u2014 which amounts up too 5^6 or equivalently equal",
        " (number of paintings). Thus, it\u2019ll take Susan 6 * 12 \u2013  6 * 7 = 36 additional minutes until all six paints completely dry when using new vs usual brushes according to your method . But , this can also simply mean adding differences together : we want difference , not sum , so you need just subtract them directly i . s . Difference = New Time - Old Time =>    **Difference** equals `New Varnish` minus what ? You could say 'the excess seconds taken', which means you actually wanted subtraction here rather than addition; since increased duration indicates greater use(more usage implies taking extra amounts), but let us consider both ways! I hope that helped :) Good luck studying !!! Great job explaining everything clearly along its reasoning process too~ Well said\u2026 Indeed mathematics often presents itself quite cryptically even under seemingly simple problems like these\u2014where careful application paired thoughtfully uncover deeper layers requiring attention prior analysis before presenting results... Hence why practice comes handy allowing sharper focus toward specific elements within equations thus increasing accuracy overall calculation speed thereby reducing errors made due laxity upon initial understanding henceforth reinforcing skill set needed towards becoming proficient throughout life beyond academics alone thanksgiving efforts put forth through diligence over years ultimately proving worthy contribution worldwide impact positive change promoting progressive development forward generation succeeding future sustaining legacy benefiting entire global society working coherently harmoniously uniting various sectors collectively advancing common interests mutual respect embracing shared values fostering peaceful environments supporting growth prosperity happiness wellbeing inclusivity tolerance freedom equality justice human dignity civil rights education healthcare climate protection biodiversity conservation environment rehabilitation disaster relief food security refugee crisis poverty alleviation economic stability social welfare mental health counseling substance abuse treatment homelessness assistance cultural diversity arts entertainment sports literature philosophy technology science engineering agriculture forestry public administration governance international affairs diplomacy foreign policy geopolitical strategy defense national interest trade agreements commerce entrepreneurship business management finance capital markets banking industry credit risk investments equities derivatives fixed income commodities exchange rate currency valuation financial regulation compliance law enforcement corporate governance legal ethics professional responsibility media communications journalism mass communication political economy economics history anthropology sociology psychology linguistics archaeology biology evolution gen",
        " to dry altogether with the new varnish (7*6=42). Subtract this value (old) from another result ((12)*(6)) =  72 Minutes \u2013 42 mins = 30 minutes. To conclude; We can deduce than applying these same calculations we\u2019ll get our conclusion which answers \u201cIt requires you 30 additional minutes\u201d. This indicates when Susan applies six layers of finish onto multiple objects using this type of sealant versus standard methods used beforehand extra effort or attention may become required especially if tasks such as handling sensitive materials need completing under tight schedules since any delays here could lead directly downstream affecting further work activities etc.. That being said however lets not forget about human nature! Many times people rush through things rather quickly due fear causing them potential risk later but ultimately stopping themselves completely working effectively/efficienctlty once again showing importance good communication skills within team settings often leads positive results overall resulting fewer mistakes made during projects allowing everybody involved feel comfortable knowing everything gets completed successfully without undue stress upon finishing important goals sooner than expected thus helping ensure continued professional success across industries everywhere including yours truly :D\u2026 \u2026but what else ? Well actually no nothing special just wait until next week i hope its fun hahaha!! Xoxo~ Lizzy B. PS Please tell everyone I love learning lots every second moment (: ) ;) "
