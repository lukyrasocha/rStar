Therefore, if Nancy wants to reach a passing mark overall, she would want to score 70/100*total question count i.e.,  70 / 100 *(70+40). This evaluates as roughly equaling to about 77 when rounded up since you can\u2019t really miss fractional problems.

To find ?? , we can say as follows ; because all necessary conditionals above apply except for getting exactly seventy percent off both exams...so consider just sixteenth exam.....she still needed one mark....because when solving logic problems you often want less stringent conditions which don\u2019t break down into falsehood due to already assumed information being wrong.( if instead she knew ten was impossible but didn\u201dt know fourteen could fail)(if ten failed too )then would change your calculations dramatically. Therefore assuming eight cannot fall short implies zero possibility exists! Thus concluding no possible integer combination satisfies our constraints leaving us without options nor conclusions hereon forward.-This method allows easier visualization since fewer variables make calculation straightforward while providing robust reasoning through simpler case analysis approaches such binary branching decision processes like those used earlier within similar context based solely upon factual data presented rather than subjective opinions alone involving human preferences involved during assessment stages etcetc..
