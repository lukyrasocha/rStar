Since this daily activity needs to happen every single working day i.e., once a day so calculate the amount of time spent walking all dogs together based on these values we get 10*0.5=5. This implies if Robert walks all ten dogs once ,he spends (total) 5 hours doing those activities . As stated above; These actions occur once(daily), therefore multiply what happens in one work period by seven because usually any person works during seventh times when not counted holidays or anything like vacation..

To find out the weekly schedule we multiply this value by the numbers of weeks; because one week contains seven days or rather, you count once again those values using multiplication method (i.e., calculate as below). We perform 5 hrs(daily) x 7 days which amounts to get <<5*7=35>>35 Hours worked over whole Week so doing mathematical operations like subtraction isn\u2019t necessary here unless if asked about subtracting leisure times etc..
