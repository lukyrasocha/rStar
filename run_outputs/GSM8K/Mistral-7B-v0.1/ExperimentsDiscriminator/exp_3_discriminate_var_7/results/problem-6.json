        " jacket equals (three)(hats price)=(3)(28)=$84 . Identify what one pair of pants costs. It\u2019s worth finding out just first before combining everything together into our \u2018uniform.\u2019 To find this value we need to figure out the mean or arithmetic average cost of these items \u2013 which requires adding their individual amounts up and dividing them all equally amongst themselves \u2026 Let\u2019s add it up! Hats+jackets=($28+$84) Which adds equal ($112). Since there are four things comprising \u201cone unit\u201d let us divide them evenly\u2026 so $(112)/4=(total pairs)*($x)$. And when you solve for your unknown variable\u2014we get $.Total_cost_(per_unit) = $28+(Jackets Cost)+((Hat+$Jackets)/two)$ . Thus, Total Uniform Value Will Equal: [$x]=[$.28]+[$y]+[(.$x/$2)] $[x]$=$28 + [$,84/2]+[$(28+84)/2]`=. Calculate those numbers...or break apart any other way that makes sense to YOU!...and finally plug back intotho come up with yOURanswer:$ [(28) + (.42*28) + ((28+.42*28)/2)] = ? We can also express another approach using algebraic operations; if `u` represents the amount spent overall per 'thing,' since we know a certain quantity (`n`) refers specifically to hats(`r`), here is my work ... n   u    r= 5   u    2 => `$(.5q ) q += 3w , w := `. I am NOT sharing algebra rules because others may not agree but rather focusing only ONLY OF THE TASK AS SUCH.. WHAT DOES THE PROBLEM REQUIRE US TO FIND?? IF IT INVOLVED SPENDING MORE MONEY .. THEN WE COULD ALTER STEPS SO APPEAR PSEODONTO UNDERSTAND ALL MY IDEA ORAL EXPRESSION!! Certainly!!! Our task involves spending....our target goal relays towards something like `\"spend no extra\"`, meaning nothing aside simply taken & replenished without additional inputted cash flow`. All steps required revolves around",
        " hat which equals 3x(28). Simplify this expression. It becomes (3*28) or 84. Therefore, the price of one Uniform consists of summing all these components together; namely you get  28+84+(the arithmetic mean of them both), i.e., calculate their averages [(28+84)/2], multiply it out like normal math operations so we find [[212/(2)]] This simplifies down further into [212/2]. Further division gets us our simple integer result.........so let's solve .......[[212]/2]. Well 2 goes evenly into 2 once getting just another whole value leaving behind zero remainder . We carry over what remains intact thus having finally arrived successfully & correctly at your desired simplest form..which would naturally read : **[106]** , representing $$$106$$$\\nTo help visualize its actual usage here I included those symbols ..like usual :) \\nNow moving forward towards completing question part B........we might ask yourself if knowing about basic algebra isn't fun !

Since those are all one piece per person, you would add them together\u2014i.e., $28+($28*3)+$28=(28*(1+3+1)) or $(28*5)=(28)*5$.

Every unit or item being talked about here refers collectively toward every single person who would receive this outfit under our budgetary plan so we take it per set rather than adding up what one member might need individually . ",
        " + 84) / 2 = 112/2 = 56. Thus, the jeans cost 56. Add together all these items to find your result. Hat price :  28; Jacket Price :   84 ; Jean prices :    56 . To get the Total Cost add them up! You need to Sum everything above so you can take this approach => sum(cost_of_all)=total_unified_price=>Total Uniform price=Sum()=Cost Of All Items Hence if we follow this order our calculation looks like below :- Total Cost=(Hat+Jackets+(Jean))->So first calculate Hats which was mentioned one time hence just multiply its value*(Number of hats)->then calculating jersey same way again(*number)*but not required here because it only tells us that their combined worth would equal half what both others collectively offer therefore adding those numbers divided into half*finished off using addition operator!!Thus,(Hat+jackets)+((jeans)/2)=Final "
