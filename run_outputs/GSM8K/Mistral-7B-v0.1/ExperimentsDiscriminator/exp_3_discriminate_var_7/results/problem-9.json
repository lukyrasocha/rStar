However we cannot divide fractions here since it isn\u2019t reasonable when dealing with counting real objects like humans so instead multiply both sides by one quarter which would cancel them leaving you just saying X=3/4 Therefore only three quarters person per incident was involved but what i mean here though is not literally three quarters exactly because technically speaking no human can physically split into parts let alone seventh portions right thus therefore my explanation might seem confusingly worded still please consider these as merely mathematical rules applied rather than literal interpretation due largely based upon such fractional values representing quantities non tangible items most definitely impossible otherwise math wouldn\u2019t exist even being able apply conceptually without actually breaking fundamental lawful existence already present around us especially natural laws governing life itself hence making use almost unimaginable unless knowing fully well exactness required down deep beyond surface level understanding yet another factor increasing complexity further exasperating clarity desired ultimately leading me perhaps slightly misdirecting readers via oversimplified approach while simplistic analysis indeed necessary albeit within logical constraints set forth prior introduction towards solution methodology subsequently resulting simplified version easier absorption rate possible thanks also general audience adaptability allowing effective learning methods despite potentially complex intricacies inherent challenge presented involving abstract thinking needed considering potential ambiguity encountered throughout entire progression described below including main goal attainment intended primarily ensuring satisfactory comprehension achievable post reading complete scenario description thereby satisfying purpose mainly serving academic purposes alongside educational endeavors undertaken presently aiming improve critical reasoning skills through engaging intellectual activities combined thoughtfully planned exercises enhancing cognitive ability amongst diverse range participants regardless age groups provided appropriate adjustments made accordingly tailored specifically catering personalized requirements particular individuals participating various organizations across differents industries spanning multiple disciplines offering wide spectrum opportunities promoting overall development holistically embracing collaborative spirit encouraged wholeheartedly whilst simultaneously fostering creativity empowering innovation inspiring original ideas spark joy creating positively impact everyone benefiting substantial societal advancements contributing significantly global progress forward movement collective mindset unity shared common objectives together harmoniously working cooperatively achieving mutual goals successfully accomplishing tasks efficiently productivity maximizing results achieved optimally time effectively utilized resources carefully managed judiciously employed wisely conserved diligently preserved resourcefull economize saving costs minimizes expenditures lower prices reduces consumer burden"
