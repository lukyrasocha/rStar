Meaning if you double your speed you halve the required time etc., implying what was true for individual koalas holding hands applies here individually too without having any impact on others apart its self when travelling alone(no interaction). It means every hour spent moving forward corresponds exactly backward likewise because those speeds remain equal among them themselves irrespective whether shared company exists inside groups during actual motion events which makes sense practically! Therefore ,the overall effort made collectively increases proportionately resulting lesser cumulative efforts possible within group size than isolated individuals doing similar tasks separately thus allowing greater performance levels against solo counterparts thereby benefiting everyone equally throughout execution phases although sharing costs only gets better once enough members exist around per target goal achievement area!!

Thus when dealing with groups performing identical tasks like covering exact distances or completing specific workloads\u2014such as crossing highways in these scenarios--you often find yourself looking solely at quantities instead of rates! Therefore `(Time*Rate)=distance`, here distance stays constant but rate changes based off animals/personnel involved .

As fractional minutes don\u2019t make sense here we can round up making our estimation quite precise enough thus resulting into the conclusion being around ~17 hours if all things went accordingly.
