Therefore, so can we solve this problem using SQL code as follows; Here\u2019s one way to write it: ```sql SELECT SUM(ColorCount) FROM (SELECT Color, COUNT(*) AS ColorCount FROM ClassPreferences GROUP BY Color HAVING Color != 'Red' AND Color != 'Purple') WHERE Color = 'Yellow'; ```. This query creates a subquery named `(ClassPreferences)` grouping records based on `color` while counting them (`COUNT(*)`). It only includes colors other than `'red'` and `'purple'` thanks to the line `\"Having\" Color not IN ('Red', 'Purple')` . Once these results are filtered again via outer condition checking if Color equals `'yellow'`, their count summed up provides us with the solution i.e., NumberOfStudentsLikingYellow=X students. As per our calculations earlier when dividing classes into three equal parts since half liked Blue, another quarter would imply Yellow lovers thus forming third part making X=$88/3$ approximately equalling about 29 Std love yellows!
