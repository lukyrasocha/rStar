Calculate the additional time required if Linda switches to this new varnish which normally takes approximately twice as long (approximately double the usual drying time). As such, under normal circumstances without other influencing factors, we can assume around 2 * 13minutes or about 26 minutes per painting when using the new varnish rather than the older type. To calculate difference over multiple items \u2013 specifically our case, 'paintings', you multiply both times accordingly; i.e., Time taken multiplied by quantity equals overall consumption respectively. Hence, Difference_old_new_variance/quantity=Time consumed traditionally -(Innovated process) / amount analyzed here .

Therefore, all things being equal, applying the new formulation will increase its drying time duration compared to the usual procedure by thirty eight point seven (approximately).

This can be calculated by subtracting the time taken for the old varnish from the time taken for the new varnish i.e.,  28 minutes (new) minus 13 minutes(old), which equals 15 minutes extra needed when applying the new varnish per painting. Multiply this value obtained above by the quantity of paintings; here 'N'. Here N=9 since Linda wants to know about duration required for 9 paintings so the calculation made was :  15 mins/painting times 9 paints =>   15*9 => Rs. 135 .
