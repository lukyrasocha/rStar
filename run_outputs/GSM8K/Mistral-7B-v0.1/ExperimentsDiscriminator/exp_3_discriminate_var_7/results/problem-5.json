Therefore, this question can be solved using multiplication first followed by addition or subtraction operation but not division because it doesn\u2019t involve any case here when a quantity needs to be divided into equal parts/groupings as specified under divisible amounts instruction so only operations like additions (-),subtractions (+). Divisible amount instruction mentions about quantities involved being able to divide them equally without remainders making sure its whole numbers hence considering no decimal point placements just integer values thus eliminating such scenarios leaving us with basic mathematical principles related directly applying multiplications ,additions & subtractives etc depending upon nature problem itself thereby fitting these methods accordingly ensuring accuracy maintaining simplicity while solving math problems alike through logical deductions adherence rules established based understanding fundamental concepts behind arithmetic expressions involving variable elements within real life contextual frames allowing versatility applicability across multitude situations providing solution pathways catering individual specific requirements keeping mindset focused towards achieving desired outcomes utilizing suitable approaches best suited respective circumstances avoiding unnecessary complexity unnecessarily convoluted procedures promoting clarity comprehensibility reducing error margin precision outcome derived employing appropriate strategies optimum efficiency achieved effectively efficiently resolving matters address concerns present challenges tackle issues resolve conflict ensure cooperation harmonious relationships foster unity create community build society better together grow individually prosper collectively unified vision common goal shared purpose rationale motivation encouragement inspiration uplifting spirit hopeful tone constructive criticism productive dialogue open communication effective negotiation mutually beneficial agreements compromise flexibility adapt change willingness learn embrace knowledge evolve personal growth development potential realize fullest capabilities contribute meaningfully worldwide positive difference impact generations future posterity benefit human race civilization evolutionary progress overall societal advancement global citizenship responsibility stewardship earth preservation intergenerational equity sustainable practices green initiatives renewable resources clean energy conservation water sanitation public health safety food security nutrition wellbeing environment protection biodiversity restoration natural habitats wildlife populations climate action mitigate effects adaptation resilience preparedness disaster risk reduction crisis management emergency relief rebuilding reconstruction recovery stabilize economies stimulate job creation promote entrepreneurial ventures innovation research technology development inventions breakthrough discoveries patents intellectual property rights legal frameworks ethical",
