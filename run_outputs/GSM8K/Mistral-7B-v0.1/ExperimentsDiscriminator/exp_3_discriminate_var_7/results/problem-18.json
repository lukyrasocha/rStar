Thus taking into consideration above mentioned context & factors along side basic assumption upon relation amongst both subject matters involved lets proceed accordingly so : First examine general rule which states 'a smaller quantity usually requires even fewer resources', thus considering our previous conclusion holds validity across situations alike here implies greater volume reduces demand hence applies equally well practically too!

        " so Sandra already passes this exam because 48 > (80 * 75%) = 60 questions needed to pass overall exams. Since sandy needs only one passing score out of both scores, it doesn\u2019t matter what happens during these testing periods as long as every student gets above enough marks to qualify their position within groups(experts say students learn best when not put under pressure).

        " add up both their scores so far; Sandra answered 48 (from the first test) plus what amount would equal or exceed 75%. Because percentage calculations assume you divide your score as if it was out of 100, let us convert these numbers into percentages instead of decimal points when considering multiples needed. Since halfway point ((total desired / original value)) multiplied by current progress yields exactly target goal quantity [(75/100)*(current answers scored)] this means one needs either multiply previous values together & use resulting formula above OR figure using ratios themselves via subtracting difference away while accounting also average scoring rates across entirety being calculated simultaneously .

Let us denote halfway through our progress towards success i.e one part out of every equal parts until reaching maximum limit which also equates passing mark here.. To find . It could either mean dividing whole available score range ,or counting only those scores within reach if not meeting exact requirements yet : Subset count till just before full marks required would make most sense ! This implies adding what already obtained value plus remaining unanswered ones together ; thus obtaining lesser overall achievement compared getting max possible results but still enabling advancement further .. But since no specific limits mentioned regarding minimum levels considered too low neither upper bound imposed higher than attainable ranges etc perhaps considering simplest approximation might suffice using midrange values ? Hence determining intermediate outcome amount comes down estimating roughly average point distribution across various difficulty categories including both easy medium hard tasks along w/ scoring distributions associated such typical patterns encountered typically during assessments making calculations easier somewhat simplistic way keeping actual accuracy moderately acceptable without excessive effort invested unnecessarily complex methods otherwise preferred mostly due time constraints present sometimes resulting errors especially when dealing large sets like grades worth thousands numbers over multiple subjects spanning several years often cumulatively covering huge portions curriculum contents thereby increasing probability probabilities mistakes occurring significantly consequently reducing consistency stability reliability long term performance trends generalizing better rather being misleading deviations arising infrequently rarely nonetheless requiring closer scrutiny careful analysis attention fine tuning optimization precision necessary throughout entire process taking into consideration numerous factors accounting variably assorted circumstances potentially causing deviation discrepancies skewing true reflection reality versus idealized expectations ideals desiring real world applicatibilities practical implications ensuring validity authentic integrity preserving genuine credibility safeguarding trustworthy truthfulness consistent honesty upholding moral principles adherence ethical standards fostering respect others dignified decencies conduct cultivated habituation ingrained beliefs practiced discipline established norms reinforced positive behaviors promoting fair justice harmony peace cooperation collaboration understanding empathy compassion benevolence generosity love kindness mercy forgiveness tolerance patience humility gratitude sin",

Total required answers equals 90*(3/4)=67 because you add both totals together before applying percentage. Thus far it would appear your friend can make passing average if she answered all 80 plus only half the remaining problems wrongly which adds up to... 40*.5=20 thus leaving us still requiring additional  67-40-(80*.5)=17 good scores outta another forty so therefore ......she NEEDS TO GET AT LEAST.........fifteen BIG POINTS CORRECTLY ON THE SECOND TEST!
