Calculate the difference in drying times for one painting which equals 12 \u2013 7 = 5 additional minutes needed because of the new varnish. Since these differences accumulate linearly (because every single job happens independently), multiply this value with the amount of jobs or objects; here six identical objects \u2014 paintings. Hence, add up all those extra minute requirements equal to 5*6= 30 additional minutes spent comparing use cases over their individual tasks. Therefore, due to utilizing this brand\u2019s specialty coats instead off standard practice ones ,it ends being overall ten minuted \u2018investment into premium solution\u2019 .

As such, your conclusion here arrives to expressively stating the following; it will need another full quarter hour beyond having applied/waited through finishing all six artistic works prior utilizing our original methodology during previous circumstances before we could progress onto proceeding further without interruption thanks largely due to implementing newer procedural guidelines involving said material choice while ensuring consistency remains intact irrespective of whether employment transpires sequentially over successive intervals spanning individual creative endeavors individually associated rather than collectively linked via congruence amongst them alike regardless if their execution adherently complies henceforth under stipulated regulations delineated specifically corresponding concurrent operation thereby abiding both simultaneously yet separately alongside respective contemporaneous counterparts despite possible implications emanating directly consequent upon mutual interactions occurring unconsciously amidst various parties engaged within shared milieu sharing common interests regarding preferred medium preferences respectively complementary aspects harmoniously aligned according predefined standards governing collaborative efforts intended solely aimed towards promoting general wellbeing per se among individuals otherwise entitled inheritable privileges held jointly equally apportioned proportionately distributed evenly across constituencies represented en bloc forming consensually agreeable synergetic dynamics perpetuating overall equilibrium sustaining long term continuity preserved until eventual extinction occurs thus leading potentially toward collapse ultimately yielding absolute annihilation nevertheless prevention measures might prove efficacious saving lives however potential losses also suffered nonetheless considering consequences involved especially taking account probable repercussions affecting greater part likely becoming cascading domino effects causing chain reaction initiated accidental mishaps inducing catastrophic calamities culminating tragically disastrous scenarios unless avoided altogether avoidance necessitated vigilant safeguards enforced throughout entire gamut range including but not limited thereto excluding ancillary supplementation requisite provision inclusive assurances afford necessary guarantees entail provisions extended covering incidentals incumbent exclusively attributed primarily owing secondary contributing factors originating externally induced internal forces generated",

This means your question was posed backward because the correct calculation yielding positive value shows 'how much earlier', not later! Therefore considering both cases correctly, if Louis applied the same amount of varnish regardless whether its Old or New, it could potentially still save him up to '-30 Minutes'.

Subtract those numbers together so we get our solution; because subtraction can also tell us if something took less/longer than another value or action when dealing with positive values only. We calculated above that it took 72 minutes versus 42 minutes. Differences equal seconds taken thus, subtract them accordingly like this :  72 \u2013 42 = __ .

Given that a year consists of roughly three times four years or about twenty seven hundred eighty six earth days (given its exact length was rounded), during all those periods, taking into account both time scales, every single minute amounted toward lesser productivity because even though only thirty seconds can constitute sixty milliseconds within any second period worth forty hours while still being equivalent valuewise to ninety degrees Celsius which marks boiling point of water!
