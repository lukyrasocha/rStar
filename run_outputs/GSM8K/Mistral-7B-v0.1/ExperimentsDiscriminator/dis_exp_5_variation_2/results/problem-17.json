Second assumption made am adding fuel requirements again too keep track easily enough however omitting them later once calculated properly may seem fair depending whom yr asking ;) Third scenario i took extra steps beyond last round tourney route ie taking highway system itself being less efficient thereby requiring longer journey hence resulting bigger mileage needed compared earlier example ;-) Fourth finally removing stadium visits altogether makes entire plan simpler yet perhaps slightly misleading seeing roadmap used might suggest shorter overall path length especially avoiding city center downtown hustle bustles therefore impact differs greatly accordingly \u2026But yea ok well maybe having none isntrest right hahaha ...

        " for three days. Calculate the distance traveled during those hours which would equal approximately \\( \\text{hours} \\) per hour \\(\\times\\) miles(km) / hr). This equates roughly equivalent distances because both units measure length (\\(\\mathrm{(miles\\ or\\ kiloMeters)}\\)). Convert time into appropriate unit system since we know their speeds and need duration times it up so as long seconds remain valid calculate them over weeks months years whenever needed converting appropriately always pay attention conversions might result significant discrepancy when comparing figures especially large ones thus careful calculation required prior deciding upon type converter used henceforth proceed accordingly let\u2019s assume here first second equals minute minutes divide next interval using division rules same applies concept extend similarly till desired comparison made ensuring accuracy through verification method outlined previously before concluding results obtained confirm correctness achieved also consider other variables involved such temperature pressure density mass energy force among others related quantities further calculations involving these factors may help refine findings obtain precise values based context specific conditions under study determine optimal route taking advantage current weather systems geographic landscape infrastructure technology resources available within environment utilize proper techniques strategies best suited scenario encountered ultimately achieve maximum efficiency maximizing benefits deriving advantages possible improve overall performance enhance capabilities reach full potential realization goal strives exceed expectations achievements realized success stories created inspiring tales follow road map laid ahead reaching destiny promised delivered fulfillment satisfaction complete journey accomplished mission completed objective reached successfully goals achieved progress sustained developed future prosperous opportunities opened doors unlocked possibilities discovered hidden treasures found gems sparkling amidst sea vast ocean depth unknown horizons ventured forth exploring territories charted new domains conquer challenges overcome obstacles faced adversity stood tall triumphant victory celebrated together family friends allies comrades peers colleagues cooperated work closely complementary skills teamwork collaborated harmoniously shared knowledge experiences valuable lessons learnt wisdom gained understanding broaden perspective world expanded consciousness enlightened minds illuminated paths reveal secrets mysteries held nature concealed beauty beheld wonders observed extraordinary phenomena witness spectacular sights experienced breathtaking landscapes traversed magnificent structures marvelled engineering feats admired architectural masterpieces appreciated artistry creativity embraced diversity cultural rich traditions experiencing various cuisines sampling local delicacies trying different food flavors savoring authentic taste unique ingredients regional specialties relished culinary",
        " <<3*24=72>>72 hours or approximately 72km traveled per hour. This totals up to 72(hours) X 50 (miles/hour)=<<72*50=3600>>3600 miles during those three days.. Next, identify the second distance which needs comparison; it asks us compare our findings against another figure i.e., It tells you the length between alaska & texas being around  6KM if converted would equal out as follows 384,400 divided by 6000 equals roughly . Calculate your outcome using these details but change units appropriately so we get percentages instead of simple comparisons Hence, convert both values , namely   384,400 -> million Kms => 384 millions miliards        And         6000 -> milliions Miles       Once conversions happen use formulas below : Percentage Done Completion /Total Distance To Start With  Multiply By 100         Finally when calculated correctly according tiop steps above Our result comes down to     (.36/.6)*100 =~ 60% We conclude here therefore ..      As far I understand only one formula fits nicely my situation thus finally coming across % completdion calculation via dividing completed portion over starting point value multiplied later through hundred resulting %. Thus considering conversion factors based off provided unit changes further affirm correctness ^_^ **Note** Do clarify request was regarding trip completion yet math asked involved comparing different distances unrelated directly making overall solution derived under assumed intent scenario relevancy... Thankyouu"
