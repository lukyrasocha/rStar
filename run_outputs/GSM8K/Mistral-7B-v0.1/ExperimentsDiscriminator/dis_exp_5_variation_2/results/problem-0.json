Converting back into kilometers might actually help us appreciate the scale compared to running longer distances like a full marathon which was specifically stated as being approximately equal to 42.195 km in length according to your additional information provided earlier hence reinforcing why understanding unit conversions can really make sense when dealing directly relatable contextual examples such as sports performances!

Since he only ran 540 metres during the course of a single week, you can determine what percentage remains simply divide : [(Remaining Distance)\u00f7 Starting distance] X 100%=(((42,000)/540)-1)x100%= ~80%, rounded off.

Therefore, considering our original calculation was based upon three separate workout instances spread throughout various individual mornings rather than continuous exercise until exhaustion like actually completing said 'distance', hence why I opted against further exploring any possibilities towards using both figures together...

To convert his running distance into kilometers, you would divide it by 1000 because one kilometer consists of 1000 meters. Therefore; Total km ran every week= (540)/(1000)=0.54km., approximately less than half a mile covered every week.

This results into approximately ~0.0128 or around 1.2% of running a single full Marathon within a month assuming no breaks and considering him training just once every three weeks(as stated 'every week') But if you meant literally over the span of multiple years which seems unrealistic hereonward as typically people only train few minutes a day but still...let me reconsider; With those calculations again made precise using standard rounding policies rather than estimations\u2026we obtain something closer instead \u2013 namely roughly about %.

To compare against the length of a marathon (which is not directly relevant here but mentioned), convert the marathon distance into meters first; since 1 kilometer equals 1000 meters, therefore 42.195 km is equal to 42.195 km \u00d7 1000 m/km which results in 42195 meters. However, comparing these values doesn\u2019t influence our calculation regarding James running because he simply adds up distances within his training regimen independent of longer races like a marathon.

Since one kilometer equals 1,000 meters, we can convert this into km as follows (keeping track only till the nearest thousandth place): 540 / 1000 = 0.54km or exactly half of Marathon distance. However, since you asked specifically about the metric in miles not kilo, let\u2019s leave our solution here because converting Kilometers back onto Miles doesn\u2019t make sense contextually \u2013 We measure Running Distances using Metres/Kilometres & Football fields size usually referenced when comparing distances relative To Basketball Court Sizes but When talking abount actual playing Surfaces like grass Field pitch Volleyball courts etc..

Since this distance doesn't correspond directly to any part or multiple parts of the marathon (which is measured in thousands), we can still provide our result without comparing these figures. Thus, James runs a total of 540 meters every week doing all three sessions combined. However, if you need them broken down into segments corresponding precisely with distances within the full length of a Marathon, additional conversion factors would apply due to discrepancies in unit size being applied amongst both activities \u2013 such calculations could become overly complex owing to various conversions involved when equating small 'performance'-based actions with large athletic accomplishments like running whole lengths of specified distances.

It also helps illustrate clearly if anyone reading later wonders about specific units used due only using direct numerical comparisons \u2013 ipso facto makes sense immediately since kilometer values can easily convert naturally when desired subsequently through standard mathematic processes involving powers etc..
