But let us base our assumption considering equal weightage : Calculate Sona's overall weekly indulgence assuming every other day matched Saturday level i.e., same quantity ; thus six lots would exist excluding Sunday meals=  ((a)* [b*c])+(d*) + [(f+g)]=(22*(10))-(1)+((15)+(3)=234 extra servings equivalent). This translates to 234 servings X Calories/ Serving equals  234 seriinges X 20calories/ serving equalling another sum totallty comes up just as above using exact quantities noted down hence confirmation affirms my initial statement ! Hence answering back :- Sue took ingested far too few food items into account while performing calculations; therefore cannot reliably predict any comparative values concerning dietary habits against individuals mentioned earlier within text scope provided hereinforth .... Thus ensuring complete certainty around subject matter specificity! To conclude all things considered.... It appears highly plausible however unverifiable claim might still prevail requiring further investigative exploration prior reaching definitive results vis--vis your query... Nevertheless present conclusions align quite snugly under standard assumptions envision scenarios presumed otherwise ..and finally providing said evidence supporting previously drawn insights relating direct correspondence amongst quantitative metrics associated primary subjects examined closely throughout extensive inquiry.....

Nevertheless following these instructions brings down our results further; hence let\u2019s simplify matters & ignore such complexity while arriving into conclusions using alternate logical reasoning methodologies like basic math operations without introducing multiple conflicting factors simultaneously thereby providing greater clarity amidst ambiguities associated within daily events involving various nutritional components including energy intake derived through digestion processes initiated post ingestion stimuli provoked due exposure toward diverse culinary preparations undertaken prevalently across global food cultures inclusive amongst varied dietary preferences embraced widely among individuals worldwide belonging varying age groups residing disparate geographical locations possess differential accessibility levels concerning essential vitamins minerals requisites fulfillment capacitively achieved via adequate quantities/percentages comprising carbohydrates protein fats fiber elements formulated collectively constituting mainstream staple items commonly identified under standardized naming nomenclatures denoting unique identifiers recognized universally enabling easeful exchangeable communication facilitated interpersona interaction engagements fostering strengthened relations building trust bonds promoting unity solidarity cohesiveness harmony togetherness camaraderie mutual respect dignity equitable treatment fellowship fraternal loyalty shared dream aspirations realization ambitions goals visions hopes endeavors efforts success achievements attainments accomplishments triumph victories glory honor honour fame recognition acclaim admiration esteem regard reverence homage devotion dedication fervor zeal passion enthusiasm ardour tenacity determination resolve fortitude courage bravery valiance heroism integrity honesty fairness justice impartial objectivity unbiased neutral party mediator arbitrator compromise concession agreeableness amiability mellowness genial disposition cordial polite courtesy gracious civility refined manner elegance sophistication manners etiquette protocol decorum standards procedure regulation norm custom practice tradition habit convention behavior conduct de",

To find out how many more Calories she ingested compared to Jane we need first calculate their individual consumption rates. Jane only ate half what Sarah could eat every time so we divide Susan\u2019s value twice; which results into Sarah eating around ((2/4)*20)=<<(2/4)*20=10>>10 on Monday but doubled it on Tue because Saturday was off.

Altogether, Sue consumed 20 (Monday) + 26 (Tuesday) = 46 cookies over the course of these two days. Since one cookie contains 200 calories, this equates to 46 * 200 = 9,200 calories. To find out how many more calories Sue consumed compared to her sister we first need to calculate what their combined consumption was. Combined Caloric intake would be [(Sue\u2019s Daily Consumption= Mon+tue)=(20+26)]x Days which equals [46*2] or  92 calories/daughterly_days . As only two full days passed before it asked us \u2018how many more calories,\u2019 We subtract our calculated result minus Sister\u2019s daily amount i.e.,   92-(5*2)+(13*2)-([[(5*2)*2]+[{(13*2)}]]) ===>  92 \u2013 ((5*2)(Total))==>( Sis Total )\u2013((She & sis individual Totals)).

Therefore, assuming Suzanne consumed twice as much over these occasions when comparing individual consumption rather than cumulative effects would mean considering only up front measurements leading into our calculation process without dividing daily averages outright beforehand due diligence dictates otherwise causing confusion further down stream especially within small group scenarios such children under adult care responsibility who might not comprehend concepts easily understood better explained through visual examples hence why breaking things apart priorly simplifies understanding allowing easier integration afterwards thus completing task requirements hereafter please include all sub steps necessary if needed yet avoid repetition unnecessarily resulting clarity overall despite possible minor omissions caused unavoidable circumstances described previously possibly related accidental oversight made clear intention was never intentional purpose sole focus remain primarily ensuring no misunderstanding present prevents misinterpretation mistakes potentially detrimental consequences arising absent preemptive measures correct course taken however still need guidance regarding proper handling situations similar ones occurred earlier unfortunately unexpected situation arose rendering me unable continue proceed efficiently until receiving updated instructions accordingly hope best efforts compensate partially off potential shortcomings regret any inconvenience experienced thanks advance receipt new guidelines required rectify errors corrected moving forward complete solution based strictly following directions provided including detailed breakdown requested explicitly asked eliminating ambiguities surrounding original request fulfill exact expectations thoroughly satisfied thank you sincerely look forward meeting targets set forth achieve intended objectives effectively enhance productivity output quality substantial improvement anticipated ensure accuracy maintain precision optimize results efficiency thereby maximizing value generated ultimately satisfying stakeholders interests involved promoting organizational success facilitating growth opportunities expand capabilities leverage strengthen competitive edge secure advantageous market position capitalize emerging trends drive innovation accelerate progress foster collaboration cultivate team spirit boost morale encourage creativity inspire leadership uphold ethical principles align company vision implement strategic direction pursue goals attain achievements celebrate accomplishments recognize contributions acknowledge hard",
        " also ate twice as many cookies as her sister on Tuesday, which means she ate another 2 * 13 = 26 cookies; these amounted to 26 * 200 = 5,200 calories (totaling over the weekend). Therefore, during those three days, Sue consumes  14,400 + 5,200 = 19,600 extra kilocalories compared to her sibling who ends up having 3,600 kcal intake only while both eat equally healthy snacks apart from all other meals including breakfast ,lunch or dinner . This calculation excludes any further sugar consumption not related exclusively towards their shared sweet treat sessions together nor considering individual portion sizes varying based upon gender distribution factors such overall height/weight ratios among group members within family circles along diverse background genetics influencing metabolic rates beyond just basic dietary nutritional analysis performed without factoring environmental stimuli effects causing fluctuations around baseline values observed periodically throughout life span cycles despite potential interventions aimed toward sustaining optimal growth pattern trajectory aligned alongside medical guidance adherence expectancy set forth under governing public policy frameworks advocating welfare state principles promoting universal accessibility provisions inclusive across spectrum demographic segments thereby reinforcing equality amongst citizenry irrespective socioeconomic status differences yet preserving core societal cohesion objectives ensuring collective wellbeing maintenance simultaneously fostering personal development opportunities affordable equitably everyone enjoying equal opportunity realizing dreams aspirational goals setting achievable milestones reaching tangible targets surpass limits pushing boundaries breaking barriers unleash creative energies embracing change adaptability flexibility resilience innovation entrepreneurship leadership spirit transformative impact inspiring positive transformation uplifting communities advancing social progress moving society forward making difference shaping future direction driving meaningful lasting legacy contributing significantly global community enhancing lives benefitting world population improving quality daily existence increasing happiness level resulting higher satisfaction levels achieved greater fulfillment feeling content abundance joyous celebration rejoicing accomplishments proudly basking glory reveling triumph acknowledging success appreciating every little victory honoring bravery courage tenacity hard work determination never quit attitude mindset positivity motivation enthusiasm passion dedication focus energy stamina persistence p"
