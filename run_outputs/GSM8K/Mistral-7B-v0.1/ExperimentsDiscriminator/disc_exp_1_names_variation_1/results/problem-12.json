With a 10% discount applied this means reducing those prices by (30*10/100)=3 dollars which leaves us ((30)-(3))=27 dollars . Thus the amount Kevin spends buying everything here is  27 dollars , as it was rounded up no need add decimals otherwise we round off our result if needed. Hence when considering both taxes and additional fees applicable only once per purchase while shopping online or having multiple receipts over time within one financial year especially before reaching next quarter mark you can conclude saving approximately ~5~$.
