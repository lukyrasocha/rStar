Multiply these values together i.e., 60hours*50km per hour equals ~ 3000 Km driven in those time frame. Compute the ratio between the actual miles traversed to overall miles; divide 3000Km divided by 6000Km results around halfway or .5 expressed as percentile it converts to roughly % 50%.

We can say Part here refers to the portion we know which equates to our Travel time i.e., 72 hr , While 'Whole', represents the full amount or Total driving possible . By substituting values into the equation above : %Travel Completion =(Travel_Time) / (Total Driving Possible)* 100% Where Value Assignments Are:%Travel Completion=(72)/(120)*100%=60..

To find this out fraction simply divide them .so dividing both sides (. /6000)%. Therefore calculating this i get [(. / . )%]. Hence percent coverage would thus imply ((744+744)*(%) = %)=[((744*()/6000))%=24.08] approx., meaning nearly ~24 %.
