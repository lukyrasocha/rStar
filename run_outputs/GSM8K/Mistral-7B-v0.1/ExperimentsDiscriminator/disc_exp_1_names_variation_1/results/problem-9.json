Using logic here means whatever X would fit logically within both groups since it represents quantity per group thus if you increase one parameter everything else decreases accordingly but totals stay same..... Hence solution using algebra isn\u2019t needed therefore substitute simple guesses beginning at 1 until your sum matches desired output ....so begin trying different possibilities starting with lower quantities meaning fewest amount possible because higher than minimum likely beyond correct parameters when no further adjustments yield exact match hence try low amounts initially . Try plugging in several smallish integer inputs such as n = 1 , n^2 / 4 , etc till condition satisfies results below/equal expected answers ; example : substituting N == POW()(n,(sqrt())) yields close enough approximation generally resulting near optimal integers ..which turns out work well once tested !
