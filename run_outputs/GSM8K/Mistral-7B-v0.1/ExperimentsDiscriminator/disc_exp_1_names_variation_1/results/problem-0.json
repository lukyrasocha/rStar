Lower SRH may mean slow decomposition due to less accessibility but higher risk of dissolution if water chemistry changes unfavorably. Secondly, Acidity Level Decreased (-ALD): Reduced acid conditions preserve calcite deposits since leaching processes would diminish resulting in increased longevity within geological structures thus enhancing CP values overall (+CP).
