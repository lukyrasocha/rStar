Since overall 70% of all answers across both tests needed to be correct, let X represent the quantity of items she needs to guess correctly during the second test consisting of 40 questions; hence 70 percent of these combined amount would equal [(70+X)/(70+40)]*((42)+X). Therefore ((42)+X)=[(70+(X))/(110)*(.7)]*(70+(X)).
