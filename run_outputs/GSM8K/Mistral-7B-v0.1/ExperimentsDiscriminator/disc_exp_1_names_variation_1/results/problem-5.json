This means that it takes two such items to make a single unit (one shoe) which would mean its half again or multiply them as follows $((dollars per item)*number of items)/2=price*quantity/unit=$((60)*2 units).$ That comes out to 60*2/$2$. Finally we calculate what amount equals.$($`Price`, `multiplier`, `$`)/`(`unit value$, `$`).This expression can simplify down if you understand multiplication using fractions:$$(P\\times Q)\\div R$$ becomes $$\\frac{PQ}{R}$$Simplifying yields $\\boxed{\\text{$30}\\;\\;}$. Therefore Daniel paid thirty dollars when all was said and completed.(Dividing dollar amounts uses different rules than regular math because sometimes prices aren't whole numbers so I thought showing off my division skills while still solving the main question wouldn't hurt.)

Hence you get : [($60+$60)+($60+$60)+($60+$60)]/$=[$240]/=$[one]*['six].
