Subtract this amount from the original bird count to find out how many birds remained unscathed initially: 48 (original quantity) \u2013 24 (quantity removed because half was frightened off) = 24 remaining birds. Add these remaining ones together with those which came during the next couple of hours according to question stipulations; thus it becomes :  24 (remaining birds already present when fewer numbers arrived due to being disturbed earlier i.e., midway through observation period or just before last group\u2019s arrival as well ) + 15(newly appearing birds)=total currently present . Therefore, we can assertively say that following such events , presently within bounds existence remains fixed near thirty point seven approximately twenty eight since rounding down would make no sense considering whole natural entities like feathered fauna aren't divided into fractional parts nor subdivisions but exist wholly unto themselves irrespective if observed individually under close scrutiny visually rendered via binocs while perched comfortably upon tree limbs gripping tight branches intermittently pausing momentarily post flight movements only ceasing entirely once dislodged prior jettison resulting either onto leaves below grass blades situated beneath etc..
