        " 2 x 11 = 22 cookies on Tuesday. Add up both amounts together (Monday+Tuesday) means Susan consumed 16+22= 38 cookies over those 2 days alone. Calorie count for all these equals 38*111=  4218. Calculate the amount spent when Suzy\u2019s sister gets one packet which consists of ten biscuits . Meaning it is equal to 10*111=(1110). Subtract this value out of what suzy spends so we can find difference(difference sign (-)) minus equation goes like -(Suzy expenditure)-=-(-Shreya Expense)=Difference , meaning Difference-(Suzy Spent)=-(shreya Spended) thus -(Suzy Spent)+(shreya Spenced)=value..Thus finding value first subtract((suzy)'expenediture)from ((Suzy'+Shreyans')Expence),to get:-[(1110+(Negative One Fifty)]--[One thousand Two Hundred And Eleven]+Two Hundred Six]=[Eleventy Three]=totalSpendingInCal.(This method reduces calculation errors or misplacement/misuse during calculations)..",
        " simply calculated using subtraction; hence it would look like this \u2013 (16+22) \u00d7111\u2013(8\u00d711x111). Hence, which equals ((16+22)-(8x11))*111=((38)-(88))*111=-50*111 Calorie intake means burning off calories doesn\u2019t make any sense here because we cannot burn negative energy so the correct statement would either not contain \u201cmore\u201d or otherwise state that both parties consumed the same amount .

        " says Susan consumed twice as many cookies (which would mean double) compared to what her sister ate which was only 8; thus half dozen plus another half (=one whole or six), hence, we have determined that Susan devoured twelve(12) sugary delights early morning one Wednesday before work/school began. Again identify the amount ingested over dinner time on Tuesday afternoon since our first line indicated similar consumption numbers again this evening when attending family function etc., i.e., also twenties divided into equal halves yielding twenty-(twenty!) sweet treats!

        " Since she ate twice as many as her sister, who ate 8 cookies on Monday, this means Sue also ate 16 cookies (2 times 8) on Monday. And since she continued to eat twice as many as her sister on Tuesday, when her sister ate 11 cookies, Sua ate 22 cookies (2 times 11). Therefore, over these two days, Sue consumed 16+22=38 cookies while her sister only had 8+11=19 cookies. Difference of their consumption equals to 38-19=19 cookies difference. As one cookie contains about 111 calories it would mean 111*19= approximately 2199 additional calories absorbed by Sue compared to her Sister through cooking alone. However, considering general dietary guidelines suggest roughly burning off around 1/4 pounds or less per serving food due to metabolic processes which equates nearness to 237 extra kcal burned assuming average body weight ~150lbs., further subtractive actions amount nearly within half kilocalorie margin error bounds towards actual differential intake versus equivalent expenditures under basic living conditions sans substantial activity alterations. Hence taking into account energy balance across bodily function exchanges plus basal levels along standard daily life practices coupled alongside nutritional values yielded result concluding slightly above mentioned estimate but align closely enough providing sensible quantitative perspective concerning specific question presented aiming precision upgrades against assumptions regarding commonplace human physical condition parameters during usual non strenuous routine activities sustaining wellbeing stability equilibrium amid diverse physiological dynamics ensuring optimum health maintenance preserving normality despite varied sustenance amounts influencing regular everyday survival requiring no extraordinary efforts nor specialized knowledge beyond foundational biologically relevant comprehension necessary fulfillment primary goals associated overall proper management personal self governance related vital individual factors including respectful care ethical considerate conscious awareness decisions relating all aspects tied intrinsically linked holistic integral whole person unity understanding coherent interdependent mutually inclusive relationship symbiotic synergistic harmonious integrated seamless flow balanced wholesome order systematization facilitated continuously maintained constant reassessed monitored evaluated adjustable tailored refined improving better progressively always evolved adapting changing responsibly proactively",
        " as her sister on Monday (who ate 8) and twice again on Tuesday, it means we need to double the amount three times because first multiplication happens before addition during calculation which makes our equation equivalent like multiplying all together. Hence if s represents siblings cookies count per night, so overall would look like this \u2013 { Sunday(s)+Monday(2*s)+Tuesday[(2*2)*s]+Wedness((2*2)^2). To find out Wednesdays count since Saturday data was not provided yet but assuming same pattern or behavior continued, W= Friday+Thursday.

        " find out how many cookies Susan consumed over these two days combined (the weekends). Let me know if you need further assistance! Time is ticking here because I want quick help right away :) To solve this problem, follow these steps: Step 1 Calculate the amount of cookies Sue ate on Monday \u2013 According to the instruction, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister who ate 8 cookies on that day. Therefore, Sue consumed \\( 2 \\times 8 = 16 \\) cookies on Monday. Step 2 Find out the quantity of cookies Sue ate on Tuesday\u2013 Similar logic applies since it was mentioned that Sue again ate double what her sibling munches during the same timeframe; therefore, Steve had \\[ 2 \\times 11 = 22 \\] cookies on Tuesday based on the premise provided above. That sums up their culinary escapades spanning across those specific dates into one neat figure using simple multiplication skills which results in Sarah relishing altogether (\\( 16 + 22 = 38 \\)) packets worth glucose through edibles when considering all delicacies collectively while neglecting none no matter how minute or grandiose such snacks might appear without any visual aid but simply relying solely upon our mental prowess enabling us deduce precise numerical totals effortlessly just by pondering hypothetical scenarios involving confectionery consumption rates within specified intervals ensuring accuracy maintaining precision",
        " each day. On Monday, Suzie's sister ate 8 cookies, so Sue ate 2 x 8 = 16 cookies. And since it was stated again that Sue also ate twice as many cookies on Tuesday just like what happened earlier (as per instruction), therefore, if her sis ate 11 cookies; suze would eat 2*11= 22 cookies. To find out which one consumed higher amount of calories you need only to multiply all amounts(count) of such product (cookies here) multiplying them by their individual weights or values expressed accordingly i.e.(caloric count). Thus firstly let us sum up counts making sure noting repetition according to instructions provided . Count stands : {Monday:{Suzi: 16} ,Tues{Suzi:22},Weds{Suzie:- }, Thur{- }}; Wed &Thu stats weren\u2019t mentioned hence ignored while performing operations below ;we know every cook contain exactly same no.of calories lets say c:=c+111..So calculating results individually ..In other words multiplication operation performed based upon above figures/statistics available leading finally to comparison needed being addressed within question asked about overall result ! Here calculation proceedings look something along these lines : ((16C)+(22C))-(Eight C+(eleven C)). You may further simplify formula expression into form similar yet equivalent following manner \u2026((Total Cookie No./Day)=[(Sum Of [cookie baked] X[Calorie Per Unit])]/total Calories intake); Let me plug actual variables directly present under consideration...Hence required value emerges post computations thus taking help of BODMAS rule applied throughout process involving multiple terms interrelated via different symbols denoting specific mathematic operators ...It doesn \u2019ts difficult but mindful effort pays off when dealing complex numerical equations especially ones associated closely relating various physical quantities having effect / impact over resulting outcome\u2026 Hence concluding through thorough analysis regarding quantitative relationship presented initially asking specifically \u2018who\u201d gobbled \u201cmore calories \u201d whether its woman called sue Or else designated commonly known popular name used among friends circles \u2014 JOHN DONNE!!!"
