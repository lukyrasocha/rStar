This comparison involves dividing the part journey taken by the whole trip\u2019s length: Fraction Travelled / Total Distance = 4536 km / 5400 km = approximately 0.84.

Hence, Percentage completion = (Distance already Travelled / Total Length) x 100% = (4536 km / 5400 km ) x 100 %= approximately 84.0 %.

Thus, according to these conditions and computations, Paul could potentially manage covering about 82% of the distance from Alaska to Texas within those three continuous working periods based upon maintaining his stated trip pace excluding breaks. However remember real life circumstances including weather changes or unscheduled events may impact actual travelling distances considerably. Therefore, although our calculations show roughly 82%, individual situations might vary resulting in different results. Keep safety first while travelling long distances!

To calculate the ratio representing which part(%) of our way was completed we need firstly find out difference between full trip length and miles moved ; hence Distance remaining : Total Distance \u2013 Completed portion = 5400-(1134)=<<5400-1134=4266>>~4266kms still remains . Percentage thus represented is , (Completed / Full ) X % = ((Travelled Miles)/Total Length)*100% => [((1134)/(5400)]X*100%= ~20.96%.

        " which statement about ionic compounds is not true. Ionic bond occurs when electrons flow back and forth freely as you move farther away because weaker forces overcome stronger ones . Because only nonmetals form covalent bonds , metallic elements such sodium or magnesium cannot ever engage in any type of chemical interaction except those found within pure elemental substances. Due to their low electronegativities these metal atoms lose one to three valence shell s subshells leaving behind full filled sets. Cations formed thus possess net positive charges equal in magnitude but opposite in sign relative to whatever negative charge became localized here upon formation of said charged particles; furthermore both constituents retain individual identity despite unions made across spaces commonly occupied under normal physiological circumstances during cellular respiration processes required primarily among living things known collectively either through term coined chemistry itself -- 'dioxide'.",
