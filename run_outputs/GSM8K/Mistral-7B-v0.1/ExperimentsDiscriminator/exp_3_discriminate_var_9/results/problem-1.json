Therefore divide both sides equally likewise splitting them apart beforehand makes adding easier next round back again toward solving said problem quicker too whenever possible especially those times requiring fewer steps towards answering questions involving lots pf data points spread across different dimensions due just plain arithmetic tricks needed making all aspects work nicely cooperatively within these complex systems called equations...

To solve these problems set up equations according to respective model types but find out which equation matches perfectly because when you graph any function curve without calculating its properties i would not suggest making conclusion about being Linear nor Logarithmically Related based only on looking graphs since both functions look similar although their formulas represent different relationships.
