This implies approximately taking around double or specifically speaking 'roughly', close enough approximation towards multiplying whole numbers involved equals dividing them rather than adding so 5*(2)=<<5*(2)=10>>as required but since no direct comparison across both methods was sought out explicitly within problem scenario neither subtractive nor additive relationship could definitively pinpoint specific hours difference thus leaving us clueless regarding any definite additional hrs needed apart form those resulting due sole based effects unique to said process alone.

Therefore if it took half the usual variance application rate(which was previously constant), but also only applied four times due to increased efficiency, you get six fewer applications overall than before. This means those saved operations totals up to ten different reduced minute value calculations compared to previous practice under normal conditions since every single 'application' scenario includes both applying fresh coat AND waiting until ready to move onto next piece thus yielding double results based upon our understanding above.(x/2)(t)=y , which simplifies down via multiplication into y=t*x*(1/2)*(-log_b+log_a)).
