        " reading per session. From the problem it was mentioned, because every time Anthoniy goes home instead of going out, which happens once during the night when not sleeping (because you can only read twice), hence he would take up one hour less making sure another routine action isn\u2019t altered or cancelled \u2013 i.e., getting enough rest/sleep before continuation onto the next activity. Therefore we assume him taking approximately eight hours worth of sleep along any period under consideration thus reducing available leisure activities such as recreational reading sessions among others like exercise etcetera(he wasn`t advised against doing so). We don\u2019t get specified if these include naps within said periods either but rather use direct calculations based directly upon explicit numbers supplied including subtraction factors applied afterwards due certain deductions taken away through already allocated obligatory functions necessary serving personal wellbeing requirements involving health condition control measures mandated especially those relating towards safeguarding public safety standards required upheld everywhere all over society concerning both physical & mental stability issues related mainly focused specifically aimed exclusively regarding combatting commonplace incidents potentially affective impact negative consequences possibly deriving arising stemming resulting largely originating predominantly generated via causative relationships amongst various stakeholder group members contributing significantly essential elements integral components forming basis formulating foundations underlying framework encompassment inclusive comprehensive scope covering extensive array comprised diverse range diversity mixture myriad variety multitude multiplicity assorted aggregate accumulated sum total conglomerate concatenating assembly collectivity synthesis amalgam integration coalescence meld fusion blend conjunction combination coherent unity holistic convergence harmonization concord symbiosis integrality complementarity compatibility confluence unification union assemblage aggregation agglomeration accretion condensation consolidation compounding merging assimilation fusing joining junction coincidence alignment coordination interfusion synchronicity orchestration synergism collaboration partnership agreement companionship fellowship affinity rapport camaraderie mutual understanding empathy sympathy solidarity intimacy closeness kinship friendship affection allegiance reliability integrity loyalty faithfulness devotion trustworthiness honesty sincerity candor straightforwardness veracity genuineness truthfulness authenticity credibility corroboration substantiation conviction faith belief repute esteem reputation respect dignity honor status prestige authority precedence command supremacy jurisprudence",

Since he watches TV twice a week \u2013 once going back home (assumed), second when coming back again or before sleeping next morning -- we can say these activities account for full three instances daily. Hence one instance would amount into about less than an hour per cycle but not specified so let us consider them all together i.e., almost equivalent within same range of calculation precision here over those specific periods considered.

Given he repeats these activities consistently throughout fourteen consecutive weeks, i.e., without taking any breaks other than sleep which normally occupies around eight standard nighttime duration periods, we could say over such time period Anthony would accumulate approximately; 5 hours/week x 14weeks=<<5*14=70>>70 minutes equivalent worth of entertainment derived primarily through engaging hobbies including but not restricted to casual television consumption & subsequent literary engagements using said visual material via light reading methodologies before slumber commencement process thereby promoting enhanced cognitive health maintenance alongside better emotional wellbeing stability owing possibly resulting indirect benefits consequent upon moderated screen exposure reduction thus potentially fostering improved overall quality life satisfaction experiences especially when combined systematically integrated routine scheduling adjustments inclusive appropriate leisure pursuit diversification strategic implementation alongside mindfulness cultivation opportunities whilst maintaining balance amongst diverse interests hence achieving optimal fulfillment during limited remaining waking hour allocations ensuring sustained enjoyment maximization potential irrespective specific recreational choice inclinations provided relevant context sensitivity considerations guiding decision making processes based individualized preference assessments accordingly facilitating informed yet flexible personalizing approach towards holistic self development journey regardless distinct chosen means utilized preferentially across myriad multifacetedly variable circumstances prevailingly encountered daily realm navigation endeavors ultimately striving continuous growth aspiration progression attainability despite transient limitations typically present due external situational constraints necessitated adaptation survival mode scenarios entail respective necessary agility coping mechanisms application requisite adaptively dynamic skills evolution embracement amidst unpredictable environment perturbations challenges ever emergent demands surges requiring quick thinking creative problem solving innovative resourceful initiatives deployment responses capabilities enhancement aim seeking perpetually evolving optimization efficiency goal setting achievement focused focus dedication persistence determination resilience tenacity gritty resolve commitment willing participation dedicated efforts earnest endeavor passion intense ardor zealous fervor enthusiasm zest vital",
