Subtract one consumption result minus another i.e 6750 \u2013 1750= 5000 extra caloric value ingested by Ashely compared to donna\u2019s consumption totals during these specific time periods..

Since you know ashely consumes four times what dona ate first we multiply(17)*4= 68 ,so ashley consumed 68 cookes; but only half was taken secondly since it says twice pertaining tomorrow.(68/2 )= 34 therefore adding all of them together would produce 102+34 equaling ten thirty sixteen cups overall hence if every single one holds sixtyfive points twenty three hundred calorie difference exists resulting into ((102*(125))-(34*(125)))which calculates out as  12750 \u2013 4250 consequently endingup equalling twelve thousand seven hundred fifty minus forty two hunderd producing eleven thousand five hundred plus ninety (.127x4. This indicates Ashley took fifteen percent additional compared to Dona thus deductively leading toward being slightly bigger due its slight increase above average despite having fewer quantities.. However note even though Ashey takes just little extra their bodies process differently causing minor variations based upon metabolic factors etc\u2026 Even when taking individual variances account such discrepancies can exist because while consumption rates play important roles physiological conditions too come about strongly influencing nutrient absorption capacities within people themselves individually! But keeping things simple here let\u2019s say no other complicating variables arise nor specialized dietary needs involved making basic math work fine enough thereby proving why averages aren\u2018t always reliable measures especially considering differences among individuals who eat similar amounts daily albeit differenecily elsewhere \u2026but regardless most likely someone might still wonder wether certain food groups contribute negatively effecting intake versus others perhaps depending solely off personal preference maybe involving health impact concerns regarding specific ingredients used or simply taste preferences instead ? Well my dear reader hopefully answers these lingering thoughts via reading carefully through explanations posted alongside figures mentioned earlier illustrating precise numbers calculated throughout discussions detailled further below providing insightful conclusions supported scientific methods utilizing statistical approaches analyzing collected data obtained directly measuring actual parameters measured against control group results allowing us draw factual findings relevant meaningfully applied across entire society rather drawing narrow observations stemming merely conjecture",

Thankyou :) To calculate how many extra calories Ashley consumed compared to Donna, first determine how many cookies they both ate throughout the weekend mentioned. Here, remember every cookie packs ten [calories]. Let us start off with counting Cookies eat per person using simple math: As stated before dear reader indeed lets not forget important details such mathematics play roles just majorly alongside cookery artistry itself even though sometimes people tend ignore things simply because humans evolved learning capability too early already so fast paced life requires someone dedicated enough writing algorithms correctly taking care whether something gets misinterpreted due lacklustre effort causing havoc amongst humanity otherwise might find ourselves stuck dealing serious consequences arising form mishaps happening whilst coding various applications including social media giants etc\u2026 However still assuming everyone involved knows best practices applied rigorously ensuring success no mistakes made consequently becoming successful individuals overall without worry concerning",

To get rid off unwanted units like \u00e2\u0080\u009ccookies\u00e2\u0080\u009d and turn everything back into actual numbers representing quantity instead of relative ratios such as ones discussed earlier, divide through with denominators equaling either hundreds, thousands etc.: so , calculate following formula hence gets us the figure concerning Ashleys additional dietary uptakes versus Donnas : ((number_of_ashelys_extra_units)*x)/y .
