        " It says he scared away one fifth (1/5) of those seen which means it would translate into; calculating this we get ((1/5)*100) = 20 birds. Calculate how many birds remained unscathed or not afraid initially before new ones arrived. From the original count subtracting what was shooed out gets us; thus (initial_birds - frightened_away) = remaining_unaffected , resulting => being(100 - 20), therefore having=80 birds still around who aren't terrified. At times when other friendly feather friends flew over adding themselves include these newly arriving guests among our current bird populace making sure counting includes both survivors & visitors through simple addition getting overall summing up as ;remaining+newcomers=total so (current_friendlies + freshfriends)=overall equals putting numbers inside equation ends yield becoming : (80 + 77).

First off remember every organism grows according to its specific characteristics including but certainly not limited environmental conditions like temperature, nutrients availability etc.. Also different species react diversely hence equations don\u2019t apply universally causing potential errors if used indiscriminately across various scenarios without proper calibration against empirical data obtained under similar circumstances specifically relating model parameters such population size distribution patterns predation pressure reproductive rates migration trends mutations adaptation processes symbiotic relationships metabolic activities energy transformations gene expression dynamics evolutionary pressures natural selection forces competition resources carrying capacity limit cycles sustainable development practices mitigation strategies restoration efforts monitoring techniques diagnostics tools predictive analytics machine learning approaches mathematical optimization methods computational simulations experimental validations peer reviews collaborative networks information",
        " out (1/5)*(100) which equals 20 birds. Therefore subtracting this amount from our original count leaves us ((100)-(20))=80 birds remaining. Calculate new bird population if others join afterwards. Next it says seven or so hours hence another twenty-five plus seventy additional birds took part along with those brave enough not intimidated beforehand. Adding these numbers together alongside our previous count shows ((80)+(25)+(70))=(80+25+70)=175. Thus according to all parameters laid down within this query your resultant calculation would stand as such\u2026 It appears you may have mixed up something here though! You see when dealing with fractions remember; only one denominator counts towards determining what portion goes into effect during any situation regardless whether being shared equally among subjects like counting items etc.. This means no matter who gets included first even just ten percent less doesn\u2019t make sense since everyone needs equal opportunity over every moment passed throughout life \u2013 including oneself especially considering human nature tends toward individualistic goals rather than communal efforts put forth collectively amongst ourselves humans always look forward better opportunities whereas animals mostly stick w",

You identified one crucial piece information I missed; It says \u201ca few\u201d minuted laters seventy seven More Birds Joined those Fearless ones\u201d. Let me adjust my previous calculation based on this new detail \u2013 so , if these additional 'few' mentioned can mean any amount greater than zero but lesser undefined numbers let us assume as minimum incremental count per minute could reasonably suggest around 4 or maximum say 10 just taking small sample size range .
