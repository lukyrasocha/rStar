Since one turtle moves at half the speed of a kangaroo (which means double their crossing times), the time required would logically be twice than what we found above i.e., multiplying 7 by 2 resulting into 14 hours being spent overall. However this answers only the case if all four original kangaroos shared duties along with just these two additional turtles or if they could actively help too during our specific scenario; alternatively when working under constraints like 'total work/movement involved remains constant', hence doubling any reduced productivity caused due to halving efficiency wouldn\u2019t lead directly to simply doubling of effort duration needed because individual worker contribution may reduce alongside slower pace & not necessarily add up proportionately thus making direct numerical correlation incorrect without considering relative capacities within actual task division among different individuals(workers).

        " Since each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, it would take them twice as long or 7 hours x 2 = 14 hours per turtle to cross the highway. Therefore, if you have 2 turtles going together, since both move independently (parallelly) not sequentially(they don\u2019t affect time taken), they still only need to count their own times separately which means it took longer than just summing up because we assume maximum parallelism i.e., no overlapping of individual journey timings but rather running side by side without influence upon each other timing. Hence even though individually each needs 14 hrs, collectively when moving 'simultaneously', theoretically considering perfect conditions excluding any factors like environmental challenges etc, it wouldn't change things hence taking around  14 hr rounded off assuming constant speeds throughout the course .

But let\u2019s make things easier\u2014we want our new subjects (the turtles) moving twice slower because according to common wisdom most animals move fastest while awake & active!

Hence we can assume one kangaroo would cover any certain distance within this period without needing further calculations. Since turtles move slower (each moving only half as fast) compared to kangaroos but not twice less or anything likewise which was misleadingly suggested beforehand\u2014therefore if you halve something while keeping everything else constant including distances covered; just consider them taking double the amount of initial required times i.e., Doubling 'kangaroo hour rate'.

Based upon logical reasoning derived directly through prior explanation above we conclude\u2026 Since both species possess equal mobility capabilities during specified timelines yet differ vastly per mass units such distance traversal intervals tend towards significant reductions due comparisons within specific unit scales only yield negligible figures thus making precise measurements extremely challenging especially since animals usually run along inclines leading varying speeds caused mostly because gravity force pull strength differs substantially resulting varied rates observed differently depending heavily whether subject follows straight linear paths throughout journey(elevation changes cause noticeable decelerations). As stated previously no absolute formula exists which governs average movements rate among various living organisms however generally speaking smaller entities exhibit faster progressions while larger bodies cover shorter spans relatively owing limited muscle flexibility limitations particularly apparent amongst mammals who typically lack swift locomotion abilities although certain exceptions exist including birds whose aerodynamics permit quicker displacements albeit shortened ones occasionally attained too.
