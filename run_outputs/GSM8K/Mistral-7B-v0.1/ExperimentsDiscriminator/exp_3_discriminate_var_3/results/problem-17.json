Note that time taken if driving continuously without any breaks or rest periods can be calculated using `time=distance /speed`. However since no such continuous drive exists as per question context; calculating exact amount driven seems impossible just off these details alone \u2013 but assuming \u2018continuous\u2019 here means covering full daily journey distances back & forth would mean essentially dividing it equally over those four calendar days. Hence let us first get idea about possible 'driveable distances'. Given David drives consistently only during nonstop intervals within one single calendar day which translates roughly around ~((8 hr)*(60 min)/hour* (60 sec/min))\u2248  28800 sec .

Since David drives every hour while taking breaks throughout the entire journey we need only consider one day as sufficient calculation period because the question specifies four continuous full days which implies uninterrupted operation considering daily cycle. Let\u2019s calculate miles driven per day using information provided initially: Given driving happens over single stretch during any complete calendar turnover rather than sporadic across different periods within individual dates \u2013 hence calculating distances covering through respective duration remains paramount & vital regardless when calculated intervals fall under specific timelines such calendrical boundaries).

That means while driving down Interstate highways we recommend taking longer stretch trips(preferably overnight) because most people don\u2019t spend their entire vacations travelling as opposed making use off shorter term drives such us getting home straight away once work ends.. But remember...the road isn't always paved smoothly!! You could encounter plenty curves along your journey which require caution especially during rainy season since bad weather conditions cause slippery roads....and never forget those stop lights too ! Also keep safety gear handy just case something unpredictable happens :-). However based solely upon stated parameters here let's proceed further calculating progress towards completion using percentages\u2026which basically works backwards via inverse operations :) Consider starting point being 'zero'.

Multiply the hourly rate by the weekdays value yields ~340.4 kms being driven every single weekend day considering possible quick stopovers for fuel refills, meal times, stretch break activities & other similar events occurring throughout outbound journeys across different territories en route along said roadmap pathway whilst taking factorial considerations such journey fatigue levels upon exertions towards reaching desired destinations albeit within stipulated periodical constraints imposed via regulatory measures concerning maximum permissible working durations subjective interpretative applications vis-\u00e0-vis specific legislated benchmark compliance criteria relating respectively transport sector workforce requirements viz proclaimed annual allowances applicable thereto).

Well actually let us just assume one might drive about six times per week because no matter when you\u2019re driving most people stop somewhere along their journey every few kilometers anyway due both outward traffic flows during morning commutes plus evening rush hour periods towards cities while returning home afterwards! Therefore these factors may increase our estimate significantly enough even though actual numbers depend entirely upon personal choices made here regarding pace speeds through terrain types including mountain roads versus open plains across desert areas thus creating multiple variations depending largely based purely off preferences amongst individuals whose destinations vary greatly throughout various regions nationwide especially if looking ahead beyond merely city centers alone but rather extending further away maybe via highway systems themselves connected directly together via freeways linking them altogether forming networks stretching great distances far removed otherwise quite separated geographically elsewhere locally apart region wise still distant overall visually speaking outside boundaries perhaps physically although virtually only conceptualized electronically internally theoretically considered practically observed pragmatically applied abstractedly existent literally nonetheless figuratively spoken albeit metaphorically represented symbolically implying reality perceived objectively subjectively sensibly intuitive subconsciously consciously innately instinctively unconsciously intellectually emotionally spiritually philosophically reasonably logically systematically structurally coherently organized methodologically scientifically technologically mathematically precisely numerically quantitatively qualitatively analytically effectively succinctly efficiently conclusively productively creatively imaginatively cleverly ingeniously inventively intelligent clearly wisely understanding ultimately perfectly comprehensively fully thoroughly exhaustively completely certainly absolutely yes indeed positively affirmatively surely definitely utterly categorically decisively irrefutably indisputably evidently assured distinctly verifiably definitively confirmed validated proven verified established authoritative reliable sound trustworthy credible accurate correct factual genuine authentic realistic practical applicable functional operational effective helpful useful capable working competent ready equipped prepared available able adequately fit well sufficient functioning properly operating convenient handily accessible straightforward easily approachable suitable workbench friendly comfortable simple pleasantly enjoyable pleasant satisfying satisfactory comfortably tolerable acceptable amicably sociable amiably congenial cordial agreeable harmonious compatible co",

It means if you drive nonstop without stopping anywhere during those forty eight plus hours(the extra one was round up), your best guess would estimate close enough) Since David plans only trip over three seven twenty-four hour calendar periods ,then based upon our calculation which assumes no rest break ever taken except bathroom stoppages \u2013 well let us consider whether going directly westward throughout its length seems feasible within such schedule constraints since neither traffic nor weather typically allows any slackening otherwise desired unless specifically requested Otherwise stated simply assume reasonable conditions apply hence allowing sufficient latitude toward satisfying whatever expectations might reasonably anticipated under appropriate circumstances when faced wth practicality versus idealistic aspirational wishes .

To calculate whether or not the trip was completed one could divide  4896 multiplied by 14.17 miles per hour*24hours=168797.12meters by using my first formula resulting again only in decimal values since both quantities involved don\u2019t yield integer results but if calculating percentages I would want integers so let me start over here converting just the initial amount of metres altogether onto something easier going instead i mean take those same exact numerical figures mentioned before such asthis equation belowiswhatyouwanttogettheexactfiguresyourseekingeverything needsconvertingbutonlyonceinthis scenariowhichinevitablyyieldsimplicitywhencalculatingpercentageandremainderamountsoftheoriginalquestionthereforemyanswerwilllooksomethinglike thisbelowequationorignalquestionsituptotextureconvertkilometrestotometersthenmultyplainunitaskintohourswhoeverchoesthatoptionshouldreceiveaclearerunderstandingthanifollowsinglishtextualexamplebecausetheyareusingbothdecimalsandsomeintegerswhereasihaveseenothereforpropermathematicalpurposessuchasthatproblemsetterneedsfreedomforallwaystoexpressoneselfwhileworkingwithdiffusionnumberswithoutconstraintofwordsbystylebeyondplainenglishtermswhosymbolismfreetoplaycanalwaysevolvingthroughintelligentcritiquessuchaswecannotsayourlivesbelongtolifeonthegroundtwowaysoletusworkupanymethodhowdoitsolvethathroughacommonmethodologicalapproachtomostefficientresultsavailableatnodetailsthencomparetodestinationtargetvaluehereinafterbasedonrelativepositionbetweenanyvariabledifferentialchangeoverpreliminarydistanceagainjustmultiplicatefindingsfrompreviouspartsaddoneanotherfactorresultshowactualprogressmadesinceinitialstartnowgobackfirstpartapplysameformulaexcepttimefoundlastsectionshouldproduceevenbetterresultsclearcutpunchline"
