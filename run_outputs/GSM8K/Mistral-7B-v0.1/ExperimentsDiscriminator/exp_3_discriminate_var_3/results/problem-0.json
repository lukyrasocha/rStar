This means Daniel runs (62meters/sprint)(18 sprinting events)=(62m/(3))*(18 mins)={~}384 meters monthly. To obtain this we just converted minutes into seconds but still use it as metric system units thus {~}(3cm)/{(3)}*{seconds}={~}1 meter/{sec}=({total amount})+(conversion factor)*((convert unit difference)). Here conversion was not even necessary since both distances mentioned herein already followed same SI base systems so resultant quantity can go directly into main body without having any need convert one or another while adding them up hence resulting our initial expression becoming equal ({final expr}/{unit}).
