Since they apply a back-to-school sale with a 10% discount off everything, this means you get ten percent less than your initial purchase value ($20), thus saving yourself approximately $2 extra (because 10% of $20 is equal to $2). Therefore subtracting the savings of around $2 results into payments amounting roughly about $(20-$2)=$18 remaining as payment due upon checkout during their promotion event.
