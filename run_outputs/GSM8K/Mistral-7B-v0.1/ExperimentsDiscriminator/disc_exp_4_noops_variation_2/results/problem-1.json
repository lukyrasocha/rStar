Hence taking whole months only ,cost calculated equals $$16x$$ . The answer is:$16*2=$32.

We know cynthia needs fourteen cartons ((60 services needed)/(15 servicies available)) exactly without any leftovers whatsoever because...you guessed right!! They sell them together whole packages making round numbers easy again once everything gets broken down into single purchases like smaller quantities usually found amongst retail shelves everywhere--which means even though nobody likes wasteful packaging yet most stores still offer discount prices just cause people always seem happy w/ cheap stuff anyway :) And yeah maybe another factor could play its part sometime soon but let's keep things simple instead Of worry about extra variables involved currently due tomorrows potential surprises hahaha XD Oh wait nope nevermind guys\u2026just stick wit whatever logic makes sense easiest first time around ;-) Alrighty everyone thanks very much btw thank you all dear friends including yours truly ! ;) Bye~",
