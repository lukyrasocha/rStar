When multiple options exist such as different types/brands etc let use division too keep things simple since its just about getting numbers instead trying complex steps especially while doing something new here! So basically say \u201dOk lets try dividing right away without counting stuff manually yet\u201c And Im Done!!

As none mention about any employee not being able attend due to unavailability of space or leaving early this means all available spaces would be filled up hence everybody gets a seat but cannot bring everyone mentioned earlier since their numbers exceed what we calculated previously i.e., 570.
