We can see here that applying the neater method leads us to calculate exactly twice as much time compared to the original style; therefore 'twice' appears to be correct but not necessarily so without further context or information about specific conditions under which these times may vary such as differences in technique, weather outside etc., hence the result could also potentially fit other options if different variables come into play like environmental factors influencing the rate of evaporation during this process among others making none definitively true based upon provided details alone.
