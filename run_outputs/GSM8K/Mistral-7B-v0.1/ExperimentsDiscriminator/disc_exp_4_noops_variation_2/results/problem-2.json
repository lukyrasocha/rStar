        " dog daily. Calculate the total amount of time spent caring for all the dogs each day using multiplication (number of dogs multiplied by individual timing). This calculation results in 10*0.5=5 hours/day. Remember that this activity happens every day so multiply by seven (days in a week) yielding roughly  5 hrs/day*7 days/week ~=35 hours/week. It doesn\u2019t matter what color the leashes are; the color isn't linked to any additional tasks or requirements implying no extra time needed due to different colors. Hence, regardless of whether the leashes are either completely red or mixed colored as mentioned earlier, these factors don't affect overall walking times which sums up our solution. Therefore, we can disregard them when calculating duration required for such activities. Final conclusion based solely upon necessary calculations reveals that if John was responsible for maintaining welfare of ten pets regularly over course of one whole week without including unrelated variables like colour preference, approximately around thirty minutes would pass cumulatively under his watchful eye.

Substitute values into this equation i..e total_time=(5)(7)==35hrs This problem statement seems complex but can be broken down further based around different variables such as color or type of leads used etc. That however doesn\u2019t change our calculation since these factors don\u2019t affect time requirements when using all lead types equally efficiently regardless if red or blue colored ones.
