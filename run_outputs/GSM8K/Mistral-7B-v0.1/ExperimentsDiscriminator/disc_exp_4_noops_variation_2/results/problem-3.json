As such over 3 sessions including both actions (TV+reading), he dedicates himself exactly another hour collectively since activities happen sequentially during non-overlapping periods. Summing them across all four weeks results in [(6 + 1) * 3] calendars worth combined activity duration amounting ultimately to [6*3 + 1*3], therefore equaling 21 accumulative active engagement span points based upon our assumption around routine application of favored genre consumption practices being consistent irrespective temporal variances like seasons unless directed otherwise due lack information contextualizing potential variability factors possibly affective future behaviors patterns inclusivity entertainment media reception trend deviations etc while remaining neutral throughout entire discourse avoidance speculation hypothetical scenarios postulating undocumented yet probable occurrences beyond confined set parameters established initially thus leaving open ended conclusive inquiry scope allowing further detailed exploration necessitating concrete empirical data collection methodologies implementation requiring target audience interaction surveying mechanisms deployment potentially facilitated through digital platforms complementary technological innovation advancements specifically tailoring interface design modifications accommodating evolving consumer interests alignments adaptable market dynamics assessing shifts influencing decision making processes thereby enabling strategic guidance adjustments ensuring optimal performance optimization outcomes satisfying stakeholder expectations maximizing return value streams yielding increased profit margins benefiting shareholders reaping advantages accruing economic growth contributing positively towards societal wellbeing overall championing community development efforts promoting sustainable livelihood opportunities generating shared prosperity globally reinforcing harmonious coexistence amongst diverse populations upholding equitable accessibility paradigms fostering social cohesion elevating mutual respect among individuals working collaboratively constructing resilient infrastructure systems supporting environmental conservation initiatives mitigating climate change impact alleviating poverty reducing inequality bridging gaps connecting isolated communities empowering disenfranchised groups",

As such, the correct solution requires dividing these results equally across television viewing or time spent reading; we thus allocate it evenly due to lack of specific data indicating otherwise.

That adds up to another 1 * 3 = 3 hours per week on reading. Together, this totals 6+3=9 hours per week. Over four weeks, multiplying by 4 results in 9*4=36 hours dedicated entirely towards both activities combined over the span of 4 weeks excluding other distractions or obligations like workout/exercise routines if any exist within those periods.

To calculate the combined activity (TV+reading) timings we sum up these minutes which yields  2(hours watching tv)+1 (hour reading)=<<2*1=2>>2 hours per session. Given that happens thrice every week, multiply those results by three equaling 3 sessions \u00d7 2 hrs./session which equals <<3*2=6>>6 hours devoted annually toward both activities together during one single week period only!
