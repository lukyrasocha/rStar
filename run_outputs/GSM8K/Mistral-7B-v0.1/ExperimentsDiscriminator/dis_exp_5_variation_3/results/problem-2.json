Therefore, John spends approximately 35 hours per week looking after those puppies! Finally, if you want numerical form using mathematical representation let\u2019s assume D as Number of Doges(in our case its denoted 'd') and T denotes Time taken wrt each pet hence Total time Spent or CostCosT can mathematically represented like below:::-CostCos[Dt].

We would multiply our rate times three instances here thus getting us back down again : [(dog walked through)x(meals consumed)=total] , but rather directly find out what amount goes onto billing purposes immediately afterwards ; hence why calculating overall value prior yields better clarity over cumulative summation post factum !
