Here nothing seems wrong as we assumed correctly about calculating the usability based upon original purchase but also taking note when dealing such problems, what matters most here isn\u2019t just subtracting something irrelevantly large like 'two third', rather our focus need to stay around solving actual question concerning changes regarding sales capability over time influenced specifically mentioned variables i.e., percentage alteration related product lifecylce within certain period represented through different numerical values involved throughout stated calculation thus allowing direct connection among them enabling easier deduction results without additional unnecessary interferences disrupting intended objective clarity hence leading toward straightforward resolution approach employable consistently irrespective individual peculiar traits characterizing respective instances under examination even amid various distinct scenarios entail diverse parameters defining relative behaviours demonstrated thereby facilitating optimal optimization performance outcomes whenever applicable necessities present themselves therefore maximising opportunities available whilst minimisation adverse consequences simultaneously avoidance potential pitfalls consequential detriments arising resultant implications potentially impactful otherwise non existent situation existence occurrence probability subsequently engender alternative strategic initiatives prompt implementation appropriate corrective measures immediately following recognition emergence identifiable risks prevention mitigation accordingly action taken timely before catastrophical events irreversible damage ensue undesirable circumstance scenario unfavorably resolved despite prior preparations efforts exertions undertaken diligence precautions implemented safety procedures established best practices adopted standard operational protocol followed consistent monitoring evaluation reporting mechanism maintained transparency complete open communication channels provided information sharing platform instituted dedicated personnel responsible data analysis review recommendations generate insights develop understanding comprehensive strategy formulated execute execution plan detail specific milestones achieved key metrics track target goals progress monitor evaluate success criteria assess effectiveness measure outcome quantifying value generated deliverables delivered customer satisfaction ensure quality control maintain continuous improvement process eliminate waste enhance efficiency streamline operations implement innovative solution solve complex challenges overcome obstacles achieve desired objectives optimise resource utilisation drive growth foster sustainability secure competitive edge position market advantage build reputation trust credibility establish industry leadership excel exceed expectations produce",
