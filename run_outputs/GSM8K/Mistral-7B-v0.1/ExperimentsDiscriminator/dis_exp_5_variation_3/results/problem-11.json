Each mini van only holds ten so dividing thirty six using multiplication works best here making forty minutes exactly half full before reaching its maximum occupancy limit; meaning twenty four individuals could ride along without overloading them but leave space overhead just like most public transportation options available throughout cityscapes.. When multiplied against seventeen such modes resulting vehicle type pairs yield eleven point two hundredth units combined area areas covered thereby representing approximately sixty percent increase compared versus standard methods employed previously under similar conditions presented earlier mentioned above(and probably less convenient than having larger sized vehicles). Here comes another factor worth considering though , since drivers driving bigger truck vs smaller car usually means shorter distances travelled overall while providing faster speeds due reduction wear tear maintenance requirements ; however despite these benefits being somewhat offset by increased fuel consumption costs stemming directly attributed specifically toward long haul trips involving heavier loads respectively required during transit time spanning hundreds kilometers every single hour away form home base location itself thus potentially leading towards higher price tags associated within said journey based solely off distance traveled alone rather not necessarily inclusive anytime cost calculations included theretofore referenced values provided prior mentioning same conceptual ideas described similarly elsewhere online related research articles published contemporaneously shortly following publication date forthwith discussed further detail below reference materials listed separately found immediately adjacent section heading entitled 'Drivers Driving Larger Vehicles Typically Spend Less Money Over Time'.
