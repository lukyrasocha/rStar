This discrepancy makes it hard to solve without assuming specific numbers related to grading scale etc., thus making current data insufficient. But considering above calculated values and previous info shared before changes made, based strictly off those calculations, audreya could potentially avoid failing either exam altogether due to initial calculation(which includes adding up individual percentages resulting into less than required passing rate i.e.: 40+x=100 hence requiring further information to precisely predict scores.)
