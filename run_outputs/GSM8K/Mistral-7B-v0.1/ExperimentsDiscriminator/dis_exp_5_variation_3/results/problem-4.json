        " Poppy\u2019s contribution first. When asked \u201cpoppy puts a piece (a/b),\u201d you want to take your denominator b times all over them; not divided into parts.

        " To find out how many pieces remain unplaced before considering the contribution made by Poppy\u2019s mother, subtract these placements from the original count; i.e., you consider what was initially present but not moved or changed because lightning speeds (which don't relate here) won't move solid objects like puzzles). This calculation yields 1000 \u2013 250 which equals 750. Next figure your mother puts another portion onto the mix. One such piece would constitute one part divided into three equal sections\u2014hence representing just over half when taking all segments together since dividing anything evenly results equally distributed parts upon division amongst any divisible groupings within its content set.
