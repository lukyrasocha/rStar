However as stated earlier none such information about its continuity over entire week was provided instead just asked based upon single day hence no multiplication operation concerning weeks can occur here meaningly the correct approach would remain simply calculating individual instance duration i.e., adding together what occurs precisely during morning itself not necessarily spreading out through full consecutive period leading till sunset across several dates spanning numerous calendar months but sole focus remains onto happening every particular dawn evenings starting momentarily following sundown succeeding last evening thereby remaining unalterated except possibly varying slightly because when speaking strictly literally any other scenario apart from merely stating exact count doesn\u2019t matter due to lack explanation regarding frequency & repetition yet clarified enough though still maintainable logical reasoning why doing said calculations yield same result regardless despite potentially being somewhat different actual values depending greatly relative variables affecting situation thus implying overall conclusion consistent among various options available under discussed contextual circumstances namely differing ones described previously having potential effects arising indirect causes causing variation mainly attributable directly correlating factors occurrences influencing events contributing cause effect relations creating impact alteration modifying outcome observed producing variations detected discernible discrepancies found noticeable fluctuations manifest contrast showing differences detectably existing disparities becoming apparent clearly distinguishable distinctions making clear distinction notable divergences become visible vivid variances materialize explicitly observable changes manifested audibly pronounced modifications exhibiting evident shifts realized palpable transformations identified unequivocally recognized undeniable deviations established distinct separation noted substantial deviation identifiable gap revealed prominent difference made obvious variance seen immediately recognizable breakup noticed large split separatist division discovered stark divide evidenced sharp demarcation witnessed wide gulf acknowledged vast rift confirmed significant partition located extreme cleavage perceived deep schism exposed major cleft viewed profound crevice sensed severe rupture felt striking fissure encountered broad crack heard loud noise produced sound waves created disturbance agitated atmosphere trembled ground shook Earth physically moved seismic activity occurred quake generated shockwave emitted energy radiated light flash illumin",
