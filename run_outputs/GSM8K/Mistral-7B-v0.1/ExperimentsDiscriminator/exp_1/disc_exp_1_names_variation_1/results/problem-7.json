To find out how many calories dorothy consumes during this time frame you need to know three facts about them; first, according to our question Dorothy was able to finish four times twice as many sweets as sandra over these few periods of observation which translates into exactly eighty% or 8/10ths of everything Sara accomplished because if something finished off double it means forty percent completed while tripled amounts yield thirty percentage marks against ten spokes on clock face when divided mathematically correctly!

Calculate the difference: Subtracting Sarah\u2019s intake form Dorothy results into : 2300 \u2013 2800 which equals -500 so because our result ended up negative meaning sandra ingested lesser food but if the question was asking who among them ate more/less just drop your absolute value sign before doing subtraction . Hence instead subtract Sara\u2019s consumption minus Dorothea would lead us to conclude correct numbers , therefore |(-500)| equates to only answering what is requested or leaving out any absolutes since answers need not always show negatives especially no matter whether person \u2018A\u201d gets asked \u201chow much ___?\u201d without using words \u201dmore.\u201d ; thus ignoring all preceding steps involving division due too simplicity purposes here & making things seem clearer :) Therefore let us return back towards actual numerical values shown previously i..e those found through dividing correctly\u2026 hence again dropping everything unessential including such thing called modulus !

Similarly, we can calculate that Dorothy also consumes twice what sandy did because it says 'two times'. This would mean that for Tuesday alone she already consumed (2)((20)(200)) or ((20)*(200)) which sums up equaling  2*(4000)=<<2*(4000)=8000>>8000 calories during only half the weeklong period when considered separately over both calendar weeks.

Let\u2019s find out who consumed what percentage of these : First calculate % difference wrt total consumption i.e., compare them both ,the person whose value lies higher(whole ) gets negative sign whereas lower valued individual receives positive one ; Therefore, ((Dorothy_Consumption/Total)- Sandra_consumption)/ Total)*100 so let us start solving it :- first add their respective numbers together; you get sum=(18+46);so equals 64In order words here our whole element increases towards  64So therefore substituting those values into formula yields:- [((46/64))-(18/64)]/(64)(Now multiply this fraction upwards thus getting -(52/64),then proceed to simplify it furtherly yielding (-13 / 16). This result implies that overall or combined culinary ingestion shows decrease via ratio terms. But since when dealing matters involving numerical quantity always consider absolute term not just percentile forms thereby resulting(-13x16)+64gives us=-208 plus (+64equals finally= -144Thus clearly expresses that actually dorothy was unable even come close too surpass sandra rather opposed! Nevertheless if viewed negatively depicts magnitude scale used could reflect bigger figure but alas reality remains unalterable leaving sole explanation behind observed differential results rootedly due disparate intake levels despite common ground set through mutual mealtime occurrence.. Resultantly hence presented outcome confirms exactitude established within original narrative whilst providing insightful understanding regarding specific subject matter addressed concerning alimentary practices amongst duo individuals named 'dorothy\"andsandy'. Conclusion:-It appears that Sandra may have consumed slightly fewer cookies compared to Dorothy over the specified time period based on daily counts alone without considering additional information such as snacks purchased separately throughout other hours during weekend periods leading toward increased totals potentially beyond mere morning breakfast preferences among couple members concerned pertainingly discussed earlier stated contextually above under review",
