Let\u2019s break down this solution like we are explaining it to someone learning math. Firstly, let us understand what happened here; initially Mr.William's Store buys milk worth 4000x3.5 which amounts up to $14,000 because every gallon costs him $3.5.

Therefore since the remaining unsold portion was less than what he paid upfront plus their returns due compensation clause applicable here therefore he gets a full return price only minus all taxes etc included if present while returning back non saleable products like damaged goods as specified thereby taking it off again hence netting him down thus reducing original cash influx before considering any other deductible transactions against initial payment sums during purchasing phase itself leaving them wifewith reduced liquid assets post such retrieval operation following loss incidence scenario under scrutiny based solely upon product quantity losses evaluated without factoring secondary monetary adjustments arising possibly beyond primary exchange contract bounds unless expressly agreed among buyer & supplier regarding same otherwise considered negligent actions attributed towards both parties involved rendering misleading circumstances requiring rectifying measures through relevant accountancy practices ensuring fair dealings amid stakeholders adhering within legal ambit regulations whilst seeking transparency prevail throughout associated commerce activities enabling equitable resolution pathways sans bias disproportionately influencing one over another contrary intended outcome detrimental impact resulting compromised relationship dynamics further straining trust factors vital maintaining constructive interdependencies crucial sustaining collaborative ventures promoting long term economic growth opportunities encouraging innovations fostering healthier competition beneficial industry sector enhancements align shared societal objectives advancing communal prosperity via mutual aid mechanisms enforced collectively safeguarding participant investors integrity abiding established principles governing traditions ethics laws mandated statutes upheld rigorously protect interests securing personal rights preserving livelihood dignity pursuing holistic wellbeing endeavours improving overall quality life standards achieved attained goals setting benchmark precedents shaping progress indicators inform adaptive modifications evolved methodologies optimizing resources efficiently capitalizing potential maximizing output yield booster effects driving continuous improvement trajectories facilitating breakthrough achievements propelling evolution transformational development phases reaching milestones unlocking doorway catalyst repercussions spark igniting",
