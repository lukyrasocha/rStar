Calculate whether applying the same amount of water increases or decreases evaporation rates because temperature affects reaction speed during chemical experiments according to environmental chemists\u2014does higher ambient temperatures generally accelerate the rate of solvent removal processes such as distillation under certain conditions like controlled pressure environments? Environmental chemists understand that several factors can influence evaporation rates including but not limited to atmospheric pressure, humidity levels, airflow, surface area, heat transfer efficiency, and saturation vapor pressures related to temperature. Generally speaking, if all other variables remain constant except for increased ambient temperatures, we could expect faster evaporation rates due to elevated thermal energy promoting molecular movement within the liquid phase allowing them greater likelihood escaping into the gas phase.
