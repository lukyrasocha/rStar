        " price of one notebook is $1.5, so for 5 notebooks it would cost 1.5*5= <<1.5*5=7.5>>$7.5. The price for one pen is $0.25, which means that for 2 pens it costs 0.25*2=$<<0.25*2=0.5>>0.5. At lastly, considering both these expenses (for notebooks and pens), we get 7.5+0.5=$<<7.5+0.5=8>>8. It\u2019s important as well to check if you correctly calculated everything!
