Thus Nancy consumed approximately 4000 extra calories than Jessica when compared over these specific periods alone (Monday). But let\u2019s analyze this problem further since it involves both Mondays & Tuesdays which may imply consumption difference across the entire period. Let's break down daily differences firstly before adding up results. Here goes; : First find out how many Calorie per Cookie multiplied by Number Of Times Eaten/Day equals Total Daily Consumption ; i)Augmentation during MonoCaloric Impact From Nutrition Perspective :-Taking into consideration only nutritive aspect ,Nancy consumes fourfold quantities of Jessica while ingesting sugars derived food articles(bakery items herein mentioned),therefore signifies heightened impact upon body weight regulation owning primarily fat synthesis reactions occurring due higher intake levels.(Weight gain perspective hence!)-Monochromatic analysis:-For Day One specifically known instance,Consuming Excess Sugars induces Bodyweight Regulatory Effect !!!!Ingest Fourth Multiple Uniqueness Over Original QuantitiesHereon...Furthermore..Assuming initial conditions being constant without incorporations or exceptions made otherwise ...i am yet unable to decipher whether 'four times as much', explicitly corresponds solely onto one time point considering additional information not disclosed regarding other potential instances possibly implicative elsewhere apart from provided stipulations.-Moreover\u2026No precise delineation concerning exact amounts expounded within contextually relevant scenarios nor relative figures presented quantitatively thereby demand inferential estimations whilst remaining impartial towards factual substantiations enabling direct calculation procedures \u2026 Nevertheless \u2013 Additional Observational Insights Required To Definite Accuracy Or Veracity Regarding Outcome Conclusion Given Presently Available Datum Ensures Proposed Analysis Subjectivity Lies Beneath Surface Realm Upon Deliberate Perusal Amid Contained Provided Information Hence Causality Relating Specific Query Factor Demand Further Scrutiny Priority Assignment And Supplementary Evidential Introspection Possibly Entail Holistic Approach Employed Within Context Appreciated Nuance Embraced Synergetically Ensuing Comprehensive",
        " consumed over both days : 20 (monday) + 40(tuesday)= 60 cookies . Given this , you can calculate the energy content contained in them using multiplication; since one sugar cookie contains 200 kilocalories it follows that those 60 sweets contain approximately  12.0kcal per sweet multiplied by their quantity which equals   60*12= 720 kcal . Therefore , if only counting what was eaten during these specific dates alone , jessica intakes half that amount meaning nancy ingested roughly six dozen lesser quantities relative to herself ; namely we obtain your request through subtraction yielding  400+720-(5x200) ~=-35kcal above normal dietary consumption ! Remember always compare values when evaluating results! ",

        " calories so Nancy consumed 20 * 200 = 4000 calories. Next month, since Nancy was consuming twice the amount of what Jessica normally eats (which would mean doubling this week\u2019s consumption), if we multiply our previous result by 2, it becomes 4000*2=8000 calories. Overall, over these two weeks combined Nancy consumed  4000(for first week)+8000(secondweek)=12000calories whereas Jessica only managed to eat half the combination average meaning she took   1/2*(4000+8000) = 6000 calories , thus making the difference 12000-6000 which equals 6000 . Thus while following those diets separately or together their intake differs slightly but still maintaining same daily standard.(or one could also say individually both get extra workout ) This means Jane gets around twenty pounds heavier per year relative to Sarah because every time Steve drinks four glasses of wine instead of water, it causes him to gain weight due to its higher sugar content., resulting in about ten excess pounds annually.So compared using different methods;Nancy having 6000-(half)*twice~amount ~weight gained during all periods mentioned herein results into Nina being approximately double heavy when accounting based off varying factors such exercise regime etc..",
        " also consumed (13 / 5) * 4*200= 560 extra calories compared to what Jessica consumes due to having four batches instead of one when dividing both their numbers into equally manageable groups while keeping equal amounts among them. Thus together all these factors lead us onto saying that Nancy actually ingested over twice (!!! I missed something...) even though technically only half those excessive values would apply to any difference calculation since it was already accounting for doubled consumption rates relative to the other party! Hence we could adjust our formula slightly like this : Calorie Difference Between Them Can Be Calculated By Multiplying Their Total Daily Consumption Amount ((Nancy\u2019s Cookie Quantity)+(Copied Value To Reflect Double Rate Effect))\u00d7CaloricContent per Unit Of Measurement\u2014which means((SumofCookiesConsumedonAnySpecificDay) + CopiedValueToReflectDoubleRateEffect ) \u00d7 CALORIESperCookie=.SoNowWeCanFindHowManyExtraCaloriesTheyAteBySubtractinEQuotesFromEachOther\u2018DailyTotals:(TotalAmountOfDaysUsed+AdjustedRatio)^TimesCookiesInSingleBatch\u2013NormalBothPeopleEquality/Ratios^NumberoftimesYouAppliedMultiplier .ForExample:-FirstStepIsComparingIndividualCookietotal:(Mondays)-SecondThenFactorOutAnyAdditionalImpactThirdlyCheckItAgainstBaseCaseValuesHereAreSomePossible",

        " Hence, Nancy consumed (4000+40*200) = 12000 calories over both days. Over those same two days, Jessica only ate ((13)+(5)*200)=<<13+(5*200)=1013>>1013 calories. Thus comparing Jane\u2019s consumption against hers we get 12000 \u2013 1013= <<12000-1013=10987>>10,987 fewer calories consumed by Jessica compared to Nelson during this time span; hence it can also reasonably follow that Jeff gained approximately or rather almost all these extra calories back. Therefore, considering that about half body fat mass consists solely out of unused energy/calories\u2014which one could easily convert into another useable form such as muscle mass development via regular exercise within no longer than six months but nevertheless still requires adequate amounts protein intake while maintaining basic rest periods throughout every other workout session beforehand likewise along side sufficient quantities hydration daily including pre & post training snacks containing proper levels carbohydrates too if not neglect which would otherwise result undesired consequences health wise eventually even worse condition following prolong period abstaining ones dietary needs causing further imbalance issues complicating matter thus requiring additional measures taken afterwards due upon reconsideration having already tried various methods failing previous attempts attempting different regimens however none providing satisfactory results leading individual ultimately towards finding perfect balance necessary achieving optimum performance desired outcome goal set yet remains impossible ever despite best efforts undertaken regardless circumstances faced currently surrounding situation personally involving self unable reach solution presently possible without compromising future goals whilst striving hard remaining positive mindset continuously fighting spirit believing strongly enough keep pushing forward hoping soon breakthrough happens sooner later once overcome challenges ahead beyond doubt nothing short potential success guaranteed provided perseverance persistence patience determination focus effort concentration dedication commitment sacrifice loyalty friendship humility gratitude respect kindness understanding love peace harmony unity collaboration cooperation tolerance forgiveness generosity sharing joy happiness laughter smile grin brighten up face heart light mood hopeful atmosphere courage bravery faith trust honesty integrity truth sincerity honor morals ethics values belief principles responsibility accountability fairness justice equity equality inclusion diversity acceptance openminded",

This makes nancy who doubles what jessie would take feed twice because Jesse took half less , therefore Nancy intakes almost double; 5+5 = <<5+5=10>>10 while considering halves taken by Nance resulting maybe slightly overdoubled due to broken upness ..which might mean like nearer around 12 but still close enough let us say 10 instead if all was evenly split..

We know Nancy takes twice what Jessica consumes so take (1/2)th of the amount of cookies eaten. This results in ((13)/(2))*(200)= 1300 additional calories through consumption over Tuesday compared with Jessica due solely to having indulged in more quantities per meal. To conclude, combine the numbers above together resulting into:  4000+1300 = <<4000+1300=5300>>5300 being extra daily intake obtained specifically when comparing just based off their activities relative to time spent during said activity i.e., cooking up something savory but unhealthy such as fast food fare including pizza slices etc..

Add both amounts together; thus, Nancy consumption amount sums up to 4000+5200=9200 calories throughout the span of these two dates while Jessica only ate double quantities compared to what we considered earlier resulting into roughly(i)  5+(13)*20=310 Calories .
