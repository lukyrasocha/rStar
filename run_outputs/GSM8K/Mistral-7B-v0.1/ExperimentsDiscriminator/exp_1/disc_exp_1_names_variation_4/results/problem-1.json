To find out how many carts of ice cream Sarah needs within these years or periods we divide the period duration in months by number of servings consumed daily over them i.e., $\\frac{60}{1}= 60$. Since all remaining people eat identical amount during time T , therefore equally divided among themselves this would mean everyone need X(=number) of boxes whose sum equals N($\\frac {N}{\\text{(cost per box)}}=\\frac {\\$ \\  4 . }${amount paid}$. Therefore; n=$1.$ It follows because when you buy only once ;the whole quantity purchased was sold so as not to exceed any portion available even though purchases might seem incomplete thus no repeat purchase occurred henceforth necessitating single procurement irrespective whether greater than required may also exist accordingly requiring just enough sufficient supply considering likely demand ahead since repetition implies surplus resulting into unnecessary storage carrying further economic implications including spoilage risks due lacking immediate consumption thereby wasteful use plus financial loss involved particularly if stored excessively beyond feasible expiry dates rendering value useless/lost respectively via depreciation unavoidably causing overall increased monetary losses cumulatively culminating eventually leading towards reduced profits diminishing business prosperity ultimately hindering growth negatively impacting performance detrimental affect adversely disruptive compromising competitive position damaging reputation undermining trust eroding loyalty consequently alienating customers potentially repelling future patronage jeopardizing sustainability prospects threatening viability ensuring vulnerability susceptibility exposing fragility placing criticalness concerning survival paramount urgency mandated prompt resolution expediently imperative essential decisive action compulsory necessary implementing requisite correctives rectifying underlying issues forthwith without delay averting adverse consequences irreversible liabilities preventable avoidance proactive precaution advisable beneficial advocating pragmatic measures safeguarding interests protecting assets preserving integrity maintaining credibility securing longevity fostering reliability bolstering confidence reinforcing faith amplifying respect affirming regard enhancing goodwill fortifying rapport encouraging retention promoting appreciation motivating engagement stimulating contentment eliciting gratitude inspiring reward perpetuating cycle advancing welfare uplifting progress triggering flourish",

Multiply your initial calculation involving purchases made throughout time frame mentioned here i.e., multiply($4.0 times 4 cartons) yields expenditure worth fourteen dollar ($14).
