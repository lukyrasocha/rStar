Since we know there were a total of 50 people who were not removed due to violent incidents alone but rather several categories including others as well, those included under 'other reason' would be counted separately. This implies we subtract this sum of specific instances ('refuse', 'steal') from the total count; hence our equation becomes  50 total - 31('specific groups'). Solving it gets us another result i.e., 50 - 31 = 19. Therefore, 19 individuals might possibly belong to different miscellaneous categories such as being late during store hours etc..
