Over those 72 hours driving at a rate of 50 kilometers per hour means Joseph traveled through a total distance of 50*72=3600 Km during these three full days without taking breaks or making any detours. We divide Josep\u2019s total journey which equaled him travelling approximately 3600km out of 6000 KM which we can find as follows;  3600 / 6000 X100% = 60%. Hence ,we need to know whether exactly six hundred percent could possibly cover such large distances while ignoring time zones effects along the road trip across North America . Six Hundred Percent implies covering not just half but twice every unit measured previously before adding them up resulting again upon reaching back home only once having consumed twelve times less fuel compared than if simply using ten rounds instead plus maintaining steady speeds throughout thus reducing wear down factors leading further savings being made when refuelling processes occur since fewer trips result directly proportional increases decrease costs associated mainly due both direct expenses whereas indirect ones arising secondary repercussions stemming forth via various actions undertaken within daily lives affectively influenced henceforth prevented thereby increasing overall costliness accordingly reduced effectiveness therefore maximizing profits generated hereinafter mentioned above regarding transport needs satisfying requirements set aside otherwise unfulfilled currently present problems exist however none resolveable until proper action taken promptly following detailed discussions amongst concerned parties involved prior negotiations commencing imminently awaited completion date project deadlines pending approval expected immediately received hopefully sooner granted thanks attribution acknowledgement concluding remark finally ending summary closing paragraph summarizes entire contents contained previous section explaining purpose primarily involving issues addressed relating specifically towards economic matters discussed next chapter continues forward introduces third installment sequential series beginning discussion starts examining political affairs influencing decisions surrounding said topics under review continuously progresses gradually expanding breadth focus incorporating new subjects pertinent respective relevant spheres encompass wider context establishing linkage highlight contrast emphasis comparing comparisons discrepancies observed providing clarity illustrative examples validated verifiable facts cited cross referencing citational sources utilized consistently verified referenced repeatedly confirmance obtained assurance secured satisfactory conclusions reached confident declarations proclaimed truthfully",

To find out what fraction of the overall journey it represents as per the question 'what %', divide the partial amount driven(in our case 3600km) by the full length mentioned(here being 6000). You get approximately half or .5 when you calculate (3600Km divided by 6000 Km), convert the decimal equivalent (.5 convertedto %) yields us fifty percent.(%).

At 50 km per hour over those 72 hours means he would cover a total of 50 * 72 kilometers which equals 3600 km because one way trip can vary but we assume only forward direction was traveled here so no return calculation required . To find out what percentile portion of his journey this represents, you divide 3600km (distance) / 6000km (total distance). This equates to approximately 0.6 or when converted to a % results as follows :  0.6*100= 60%. Therefore if Josef followed this pattern , he theoretically covers about 60% of this specified journey before making it up till texas without considering any other external factors such delays due traffic jams among others based off available information provided during problem statement thus rounding down makes sense within these parameters leaving us option 'e'.

Consequently multiplying original value \u00d7 reduction rate yields new adjusted quantity: old measure \u00b7 fraction representing decrease=. Hence .

        " 50 * 24 * 3 = 3600 hours traveled. Each hour covers 50km so over these three days; Joseph would cover 50 * 3600=180000 kilometers . Hence ,Percentage Covered=(Distance Covered)/(Total Distance)x 100% ; Percentage Covered=[ [180000/(6000*3)]] * 100%= % ~~[ [180000 /18000 ]]*  100 = %. This means that if one calculates exactly we come across something absurd because our results implies covering almost ten times faster than stated speed or less time spent travelling which isn\u2019t possible! Thus round off values might need approximation here i.e., approximately say rounded value as percent can only take certain form such decimal places up till digit '9'. Round it off upto hundredth place you get about percents ranging around near but never reaching towards thousands mark thus ending out within acceptable range keeping everything realistic considering limitations faced while doing calculations practically too often lead us astray resulting wrong figures arising mostly due errors during computations instead right answers happening occasionally thanks lucky breaks sometimes happen otherwise usually not case always unless careful enough working ensures accurate outputs delivered everytime whereas human error common among most folks makes matters worse adding unnecessary complexity unnecessarily making things messier overall leading confusion amidst involved process further aggravated situation complicating efforts even harder trying hard getting desired output finally failing miserably ultimately causing frustrations building headaches eventually patience wears thin leaving everyone tired exhausted drained energetically empty devoid optimism vanishing completely disappear hopeful moments fleeting rarely occurrences seen throughout life itself unfortunately however still persistently dream big aim high goals achieved frequently although infrequently nonetheless achievements celebrated happily proudly triumphantly accomplishments appreciated widely admired applauded enthusiastically reverently respectfully honoured gloriously laudingly praised vociferously acclaimed loudly cheered fervently encouraged cheerleading team spirit booster morale enhancer motivator inspirational speaker keynote presenter guest lecturer invited speakers welcome welcoming address opening ceremony grand finale award ceremonies closing remarks farewell goodbye hugging tight warm embrace tender kiss love passionate romantic relationship affection",

We need to determine this result first before we can find out the percentage of the 6000 km journey from Alaska to Texas it represents. Therefore once calculated using above formula; To convert this value back into miles as required per question : divide your current output over six digits place .Then move decimal point one space towards right or multiply by hundredth fraction.. It means if you get say Xxxx Mm Kms , just add zeros till reaching tens spot so instead Of saying 'X thousand' You would simply type 'XXXXMK'. Finally compute following expression -> ((distance_travelled_in_km) / Total_Distance) *  100%. Using our previous calculation I arrived finally up to approximately seventy eight percent therefore answering :- Seventy Eight Percent",
        " time traveled ((number of days)*(hours per day)) gets you miles driven during those three whole driving days which totals up to approximately halfway across country according to our calculation above so therefore if one was calculating how far Joe managed within these period under provided conditions , it would equal roughly around ~~50% since we\u2019re talking about relative terms as opposed actual distances being measured hence round off figure based primarily upon proportionate consideration thus resulting intp conclusion .
