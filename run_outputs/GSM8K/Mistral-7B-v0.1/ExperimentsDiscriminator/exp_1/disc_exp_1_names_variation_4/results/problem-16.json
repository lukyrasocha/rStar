        " 2 out of every ten units (gallons) of milk became unusable because it spoiled before consumption by customers; hence only eighty percent(i.e., Eight tenth or Two Hundred Percent \u2013two hundredth-) remain good for use while twentypercent goes bad immediately when brought home thus unfit into sale making up most cases during transportation itself since no one wants their kids drinking something made under unhygienic circumstances nor even worse than poison intake! To calculate the weight value based upon these proportions alone let us divide all values accordingly like so... First off ,we need multiply those fractions together using division operations first rather doing anything fancy here just stick with simple algebra rules instead--that means times / equals minus (-), addition '+' becomes subtraction ('\u2014')and vice versa unless otherwise specified within particular examples provided above\u2026So our starting point would look similar yet slightly simpler:-Total Revenue:$= 1*(-)(+)$ Total Refund Request?:$-_refund$ Multiplying across equations yields::$\\begin{array} {ccccc}& & {-}(& \\\\ \\times )(\\div)\\end{array}$ This simplifies further down : $-------+----+-$ Using common denominators we can get rid altogether eliminated any remaining terms leading straight towards getting correct amounts needed .In this regard therefore->Revenue From Milk Sales :-=\\$-\\frac{(%)}{(%)}*\\frac{\\$}{gal}= -\\$$\\frac{{\\cancel{%}}}{\\cancel{(%)}}\\times {\\$}\\frac{\\cancel{gal}}{\\!\\!\\!\\mathrm{} }\\normalsize=- \\$(\\text{\\$} \\cdot (\\text{\\}\\,\\,\\,\\, \\rm g))=\\$\\left|\\,$Refund Request := $\\,-~\\left\\{~~~R~\\right\\}~$\\\\ Hence following equation below:\\\\[   R\\,<!= ~{-}*(($\\,\\,)\\,<\\,>\\!$)[\\text{[}]]$~~~~~~~~~~~~___\\nonumber\\]We know from above calculation statement B:[.]-->Gal.~B:[.]=$+$[$] --- [|]{--- |}[[]][,]](where\\; P:=Price\\/per gal.)Then Growl\\_Milk:P=\\frac{$}{(gram)=p/(ml)>?} Thus Sale Price p:\\ =\\ $\u2005$(Lbs)&quot;&gt;\\ !\\)Thus Gal.(Cases): L=&nbsp;\\!(case)=\\cuberoot[(",

Thus , returning all spoilt goods results into getting full payment plus partial minus equalizing part equals to : [refund] = [full paid ] \u2014 [in case if everything goes bad without returns]-> subtract [[spoiled]] @[price]/two ->add both sums together We know returnable products quantity -->return%=[[amount_not_expired]];[[retention ]]=$|[(original)|\u2212|(expired)*2|]$-->final returntotal=(no.)&gt;((total)&gt;-(($@$.$))*(.[.(.]*$[@])/$[^]*<strong><</strong>&lt;(.[$].[$(.).]+)(.$[)]*[-]])+((.<.</).$-[([.*]).]*)\r",

Next we need to calculate what fraction didn't pass their best before dates which caused them being unsuitable for sale; this amounts to 2 / 5 times the original volume of milk (which can also represent half or ~45% percent). To find out exactly how much milk actually went bad multiply it against the initial stock size you received such as so: 2 / 5* X= mills spoiled Find 'X'. Multiply both sides of your equation using inverse operations meaning you want one side isolated hence multiplying only leaves numbers while subtracting gets us rid of unknown variables like fractions etc : X=(mils)=(milk)spoilt   Divide across numerators denominator divide:(multiplication)division    You might recall that division involves flipping all involved values around when solving algebra problems called reciprocal thus ,the resulting product would become smaller if applied here since taking large quantities into account : ((recipofraction)(originalvalue)) Hence ; (mill)/((twofifthsunits))=>Milliliters divided over units found above..this results intotalamountunitesremaining\u2026afterprocessing .
