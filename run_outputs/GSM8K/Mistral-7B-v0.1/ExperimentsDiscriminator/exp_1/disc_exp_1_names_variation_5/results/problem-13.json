        " more birds join the flock (the remaining ones). Calculate this using subtraction since we know that 4 birds flew off due to being startled; subtract these from the initial count: Subtracting results in 12 - 4 = <<12-4=8>>8 braves still inside the yard as well as identifying what happens next because according to the description, soon enough another group decides to stick around instead while leaving behind those who fled earlier so it becomes clear hereafter when calculating accordingly within context overall based upon logical steps through math sequence operations such arithmetic procedures implemented via appropriate relevant algorithmic approach towards solving underlying numerical equation system thereby yielding precise outcome desired hence answering specific query posed namely 'how many feather friends currently frolick & flitting about freely across our fine frontal firmament?' ",
        " the remaining bird population (after considering those who ran due to getting hit). Calculate using arithmetic operations as follows \u2013 Subtract the feathered friends fleeing following foul play first ($12-$4=$8)$ To find out how numerous these brave creatures became when accompanied by additional aviators, integrate incoming inhabitants($8+20=28$). Therefore, 28 friendly four-legged flying fellows found solace within Samuel\u2019s sanctuary subsequent storming.$ \\boxed{\\text{Final "
