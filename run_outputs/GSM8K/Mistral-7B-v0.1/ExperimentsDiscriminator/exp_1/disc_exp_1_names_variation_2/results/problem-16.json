Hence, we can calculate this as follows: \\[ 4000 \\cdot \\$3.5= \\$14,000 \\] Next, identify what proportion went bad before being used up or consumed since it was thrown away hence no profits came through its sale price and also removed him right off their earnings outrightly (moneywise) due to lack use value resulting into loss because nothing gets gained using them except time spent fetching water etc.).

According to this statement \u2014their research shows that one fifth of it ended up going bad prior to use(you can see here why I took away only fractional amounts earlier instead of just multiplying directly) To figure out exactly what quantity of our original supply fell sick during transportation time etc., first calculate three quarters of everything because those remain good based off data obtained via extensive testing! Since half means dividing into equal parts right?(remember division involves breaking something down rather than combining things), four divided evenly equals eight thus creating groups called fourths .Further simplification leads us back toward sixth ratios since both denominators involve common factors..Finally calculating quartering using fractions allows me determine specific quantities needed within context providedabove!! Henceforth understanding thirds becomes easier once knowledge regarding previous calculations gets acquired :D Finally concluding all work performed upon evaluating percentages involved ,resultant figures ultimately calculated indicate approximately twenty seven hundred ninety six units worth returning due too poor handling oversee while still keeping above mentioned numerical relationship intact thanks enough!!!

Initial payment made by Mr. Thomas would thus sum up as follows; Total Payment Made=Total Quantity*Cost Price i.e.,  4000*$3.5=$14000 . Next determine which fractional quantity needs adjusting towards return considering one fifth gone bad upon receipt according to facts provided above so far (i) Fraction Required To Be Returned=(1/5)*Total Amount Purchased $(Amount Received)(Remember this value represents only the damaged goods hence cannot exceed actual purchase volume); Hence,(1/5)$(Refund Due)=$14000*(1/5), Solving yields Refund Value:$2800 , Conclusion Finally consider statement about no discount being levied against returns during such transactions when computing eventual outlay or rather savings herein involved.. As nothing concerning rebate policy surfaces till present moments we hold steady our figures without alterations.(Assumption based off mentioned criteria).

It becomes evident here that returning spoiled products implies dividing rather than reducing quantities further via subtraction; hence, calculate how many liters of milk became unusable using proportions based upon information provided within the inquiry \u2013 namely 'a fifth', equating approximately one fourth being beyond its usability period due to their proximity towards halfway points when counting fractions divisible only by powers of 2 like these!

Refund means original price charged minus any discounts during purchase time ,so since no one claims the product can still get their cash back but only receive credits if anything happens this goes into next transactions as well so when we calculate return amounts don't consider those yet just straight up multiply prices times quantities without assuming rebates unless stated such cases may occur therefore subtracting calculated costs against sales revenue helps determine actual profit margins considering returns even though unclaimed ones too hence what really matters here isn't reducing these losses directly out right like usual customer service policies however determining net income involves knowing both incoming revenues plus deductions made because customers might change their minds sometimes leaving stores disappointed afterwards thereby causing them financial loss especially amongst smaller businesses due lack funds compared larger enterprises capable handling sudden shifts demand supplying products accordingly also take note regarding stock levels within storerooms ensuring proper inventory management systems implemented across all departments including purchasing operations maintenance functions administration control personnel etc ensure sufficient capital allocation towards warehousing storage units required keeping adequate supplies available along distribution channels thus optimizing overall supply chain efficiency improvements leading toward better economic performance metrics achieved through streamlined operation processes resulting greater operational efficiencies achievable while simultaneously maintain effective communication strategies employed throughout organization aimed producing improved employee morale enhancing workplace culture ultimately yielding higher job satisfaction rates among staff members facilitating increased retention rates promoting long term career stability options provided employees appreciate feeling valued respected regarded highly appreciated rewarded sufficiently acknowledged honored recognized accomplished achieving personal growth opportunities offered allowing individuals develop professional skills necessary becoming successful contributors positively affecting companions environment benefiting organizations alike encouraging everyone involved helping realize shared goals together working cohesively collaboratively coordinately collective effort building strong team bond relationships developing mutual trust bonds fostering loyalty commitment partnerships reinforcing sense community belonging unity togetherness cooperation understanding supporting fellow colleagues assisting help others advance careers further accomplish great things succeed beyond expectations reach new heights overcome obstacles conquer challenges tackle problems solve conflicts negotiate compromises resolve disputes",

As such since these sales cannot go through, it implies that Mr.Thomas also received no income hence all amounts paid would automatically lead into reimbursements or returns as we say them; making him eligible for a full return therefore obtaining back his outlay i.e.; Refund sum=$14000. To calculate how much refund Mr.Thomas gets based solely off proportion spent getting bad products so divide what happened up across the whole quantity thereby determining our base ratio equation using proportional reasoning like below.. We want only those who didn\u2019t make purchases while others made their payments correctly equal but reversely instead let us assign variables first . Let X represents good quality product quantities thus Y symbolizes defective ones , Total Sale Price P denotes overall costs involved too ; With respect to above information lets apply logic here : Consider everything together before dividing against smaller parts afterwards .. Good QtyX+BadQtyY=Total QtiesPx($)+Py ($)=Nevertheless Taking known values provided earlier including totals & individual sale prices respectively...So finally multiply fractional ratios calculated previously times its corresponding numerator yields answers needed most efficiently possible !
