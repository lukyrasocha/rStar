That\u2019s because all six legs belong to three separate individuals which means only counting three parts instead four doesn\u2019t matter if you consider their prices separately like above . And multiplication comes into play here since those counts form multiple groups rather than single occurrences unlike addition etcetera\u2026 Therefore multiplying this value against itself again results onto calculating ten times its worth whereas doubling up every individual item just once leads us towards double spending thus concluding our calculation result accordingly : $$$$$$..

LOL OK BACK TO PROBLEM AS IS NOW We know our starting amounts ($60 worth) From above I wrote \u2018Each pair costs twenty plus eighteen equals four hundred seventy eight.\u2019 Your guess may vary but my approach didn`t involve guessing anything hahaha : ) Actually according tommy said \u201ceach\u201d represents exactly ten percent not thirty etc.,which implies something called proportion reasoning needed perhaps?? Like proportions aren`e hard neither am Im going overboard explaining stuff simply enough anyhow .. Good job fellow friends !!! Okay never mind trying harder than necessary cause nobody likes working extra unnecessary labor hours unless its fun huh ? :-) Let us go back further ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ At least start thinking logically why wouldn\u2018t Joe buy additional items besides footwear ?? Perhaps spending less time sitting around watching tv??? Or maybe spend quality family bonding experiences outside instead , such exciting adventures involving nature activities or taking vacations abroad somewhere exotic every few years (!!) .
