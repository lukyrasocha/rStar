Therefore out of those still not yet set into place; about this amount remained undone i.e., roughly 25% or 250 pieces ((Total Pieces / 2). Since the question asks specifically for leftovers following these maneuvers rather than overall completion percentage, you could say only one piece needs placement since every other part formed due to joint action falls under complete assembly.

To know this fraction as actual numbers rather than ratios we can convert it back into whole pictures using multiplication factor which equals to floor(1000*(1-(9/16))). Using Python code rounding down operation '//': python builtin function `floor()`. Do not rely solely on calculator! Therefore, leaving about **444** pieces still need place.

During mother\u2019s turn ,she put another third(1/3):    2000x1/3 = ~666 or about 667 depending upon whether one rounds up or down if using decimals or fractions respectively since these values cannot actually exist.

Later, according to our problem statement, her mother puts a piece every time taking up three times as large share leaving what fraction behind ? Let's first figure out how many pieces her Mom put together; since these make up one third (\\(\\frac{1}{3}\\))of all unplaced units ,we multiply \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\)th times all leftover portions so far:\\( \\frac{1}{3}\\times  750=250\\).
