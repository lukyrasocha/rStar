To determine whole sale purchase prices, add all four numbers together--so twenty eight plus seventyfive minus six hundred twelve divided into fourth parts yields fifty seven percent off markdown pricing (.52); Therefore simply dividing thirty thousand pounds by ten sets us up perfectly because every set represents ninety sevens evenly split amongst themselves resulting outwards onto various components thereby accountably representing what part constitutes individual items within collective totals!
