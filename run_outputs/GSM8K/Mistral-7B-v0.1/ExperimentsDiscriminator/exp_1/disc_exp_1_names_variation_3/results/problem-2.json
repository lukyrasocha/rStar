Consider factors such as species diversity among birds and potential exceptions due to physical conditions (e.g., injury). First, while observations like watching various pigeons flying might lead us to generalize that most bird species possess the ability to fly because we observe flight being common in those particular instances, jumping to conclusions without considering exceptional cases would indeed reflect cognitive bias known commonly as overgeneralization.\"Existential flaws emerge\".
