Therefore your calculations above were ok :) Finally let me point out just another very important way you may quickly reach correct conclusion about such tasks without any further need of extra mathematical manipulations using simple mental math strategy called commutative property . That works best here so please try apply whenever possible ;-) When working basic operations like addition , subtraction or even those used while evaluating algebraic expressions don 't forget always keep balance formula intact unless stated otherwise specifically ! Algebra deals mainly with equations whose variables remain constant across multiple steps within expression itself during entire solving procedures thus keeping equalities true throughout operation stage changes allows simplification possibilities yield optimal performance gains due better optimization methods employed subsequently hence greater understanding gained over subject material ..

Essentially, it provides a theoretical estimate of the maximum running time required based on input size ('n'). This measure helps compare which algorithms run better relative to others without considering specific hardware details such as memory speed etc., just like comparing car models purely by their top speeds would ignore variables such as fuel consumption, durability among other factors.

        " pairs per child (each child gets 2 pairs). Each child pays $(60)(2) . Calculate this value as follows: ($60)*(2)=$120 . This means every single kid paid $120 in total since we multiply just once because we already know it was $60/pair instead of needing extra info about different prices or discount rates etc.. Finally find out what all three kids combined spent altogether together : Total Cost= [($120)_per_child]x[number _of_children]=[$120]_* [3_. Final ",
        " each child so it would be twice as expensive; this means (2*x) shoe sets per kid which equates ((2*($60)))=(($120)). Because Michael purchased these items for 3 kids multiply your answer ($120)*(kid\u2019s count), or $(120)(3)=$(360). This can also be written using parenthesis like thus $$120*(child_count)$$, meaning if we knew what \u201cchild_count\u201d was, we could calculate directly without having multiplied out first steps into individual prices times quantities before performing multiplication across those terms . It shows clear algebraically correct math logic when dealing variables representing unspecified values\u2014so don\u2019t discard such potentially useful information even though not explicitly asked about here ! Overall however , both methods lead toward same conclusion : overall spend ~$$360 USD depending upon quantity purchase amounts etc \u2026 Consider verifying accuracy against external sources perhaps ? :)   ",
        " (pairs), which equals revenue gained or paid out when goods/services acquired; so first multiply the unit value times quantity purchased i.e., units X dollar_per_unit= Revenue . Let us also assume Price represents amount spent(paid); hence Purchase can represent spending , whereas Cost describes accumulated expenditure . Therefore we calculate : Total Spent = NumberOfPurchases \u00d7 UnitPrice ; finally solve as indicated below:  ",
        " This equals 60*2=120$ . Since all three children get this amount worth of new shoes we need multiple it against themselves as follows , so multiply 120\\times3 which yields them getting  360$. ",
        " (3). That's $((60*2)*3)=(120*3)$ which equals$ 360$. The answer is: 360. Good job! Keep up the good work!

I hope you found my solution helpful..!!:)"
