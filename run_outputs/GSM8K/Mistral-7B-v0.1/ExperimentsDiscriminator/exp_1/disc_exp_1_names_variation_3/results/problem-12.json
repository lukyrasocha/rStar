Add up these amounts before applying any other factors like quantity or percentage off: (notebook_price*quantity) + (pen_price*quantity) + (calculator_price*quantity)+(geometry_set_price). This yields $(1.5)*5+(0.25)*2+$(12)+$10= [eval((1.5*5)+(0.25*2)+12+10)=23]. Subsequently multiply this value by ((percentage/100)), which equates to your output; meaning you get 23*($1-(10/100))$, simplified as 23*(0.9); yielding $[calc<expr><sub><code>>(23*0.9)]=$20.7$.

Multiply units by their prices ($1.5 x 5) + ($0.25 x 2) + $12 (for one calculator) + $10 (geometry sets). That would equal to $7.5+$0.5+12+10=20$. Since the shop offers a 10% off deal apply this rate to find the amount saved [$20 x .1]. Which totals up being $2 as savings. To calculate what we pay subtract your saving from our earlier calculated sum:$20-$2=$18 $. Therefore it means you only need to fork out 18 dollars so that makes sense since when buying multiple things if I can get % or fractional reduction my expenditure goes down accordingly.. Conclusion: Given these calculations above here\u2019s another way! Subtracting individual product sale amounts rather than using percentages alone\u2026 We start again calculating original numbers which include respective unit_price*item quantity values(e.g., `$1.5 \\times 5` plus `($0.\\bar{2} /1)` times  2`).

        " sold at 1.5$, so it costs 5*1.5 = 7.5$. Two pens are sold at .25$ each, so it totals up to 2*.25=$0.5$. Adding these costs together we get ($0.5+7.5$) which equals 8$. Calculations above shows us just the purchase price before any possible offers or deals (like this one). Since our customer gets offered a 10% off deal , subtracting them brings down their bill:$0.1*$8= $.8 less; therefore, $(0.8) can simply take away from(8$). Thus leaving ((.$8-$0.8)/($))=.7\u00b2/($)=~$7.2 as your resulting amount paid out according to shopping guidelines provided herein..
