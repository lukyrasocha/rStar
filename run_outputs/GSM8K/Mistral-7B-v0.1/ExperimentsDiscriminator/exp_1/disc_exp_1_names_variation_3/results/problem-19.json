Multiply them together ((6 * 3.5), equalling a difference of about 21 extra hours because 7x(6)= 42 initial expected manhours minus .5 multiplied by those already accounted hrs equals roughly equaling additional  \u2248 21 overall ). Thus , applying logic based strictly off numerical comparisons rather than specific contextual knowledge regarding art procedures & techniques : One might consider taking advantage hereof certain peculiarities present within our established facts such 'an average individual typically requires approximately three weeks unless specified differently', allowing us thus far ignore any potential unspecified influences like possible variations resulting directly out of said conditions affect both actual production speeds AND perhaps indirect factors influencing output performance over prolonged intervals yet not necessarily alterations linked purely via changes implemented during direct interaction periods themselves hence further reducing unnecessary complications while achieving desired ends even if no clear pattern exists presently known otherwise whatsoever ; however ultimately results remain subjective until otherwise determined afterwards through either empirical observation methods utilizing scientific data gathering devices etcetera available currently lack sufficient resources permitting validated testing under controlled environment settings usually accompanied naturally simultaneously involving several variables involved thereby rendering somewhat ambiguous consequences generally viewed unfavorably nonetheless practicable approaches exist when dealing situations often encountered daily life experiences including most important ones arising amongst friends making sure everything goes smoothly whenever planning activities ahead instead rushed conclusions leading towards disastrous scenarios albeit temporarily avoidable despite inherent flaws associated mostly related primarily specifically concerning social aspects alone but still essential elements worth considering carefully especially relevant issues relating personal interactions closely interconnected relationships mainly friendships among ourselves collectively helping others build better bonds consequently benefiting humanity progress globally improving quality versus quantity matters significantly whilst also providing mutual understanding plus respect beyond mere surface level superficial encounters nevertheless fostering lasting connections building stronger foundations solidifying long term impact potentially generating positive societal change locally nationwide internationally too therefore having massive implications universally reaching almost everywhere although limited coverage",

        " for six coats (with new varnish) to dry completely \u2014 this can simply mean multiplying across i.e., Drying Time_NewVarInOnePainting*numberOfPaintings; hence TotalDryTimeWithNewVarnish=12minutes*6paintings=72mins or Convert these values into hours since we only need relative difference/proportions here which leaves us nothing other than finding their sum firstly. Hence SumtotalOriginalTime+SumTotalDrierateNow=sum(7min)+Sum(72min)=84 min but remember our task specifically asks 'how much longer', you're looking strictly for increase rather something like comparing percentages against base case etc...Thus subtract what was obtained previously before starting calculations altogether if not stated outright while remaining cognizant about any constraints set forth within prompt itself such as maintainance order integrity versus disregarding ordering entirely depending largely upon whether said constraint aligns well wth prevalent logical understanding standards being followed during calculation process..

        " problem also says it takes 12 minutes for one painting when Lisa uses this brand because those paints usually don\u2019t need extra coats like others sometimes require. Therefore subtracting these values we can determine the difference which tells us exactly what amount of additional seconds per single painting Lisa might spend waiting if needed but unfortunately no information about double coats was mentioned so assuming all else stays constant our initial calculation remains correct; Hence comparing both results (old vs new) reveals clearly increasing wait times due solely towards fresh application techniques & materials involved while adhering strictly not altering original set conditions or adding further complications into already existing framework hence concluding herewith without considering multi layer applications nor implicating variables external within established parameters thus maintain consistency across comparative scenarios ensuring comprehensive assessment based entirely upon direct parameter comparison thereby arriving unambiguously onto conclusion above elucidated briefly yet encapsulating full range complexity intrinsic inherently present throughout entire investigational process yielding resultant numerical disparity indicative exclusively attributed unequivocally toward modification introduced via transition shift adoptive nature manifest visibly apparent through discernible increase explicitly observed immediately post commencement stage sequentially following initiation phase consequent directly stemming precisely originated differential distinctiveness arising singularly emerging forthright owning independent attribute isolated standalone effectively separate disregarding interrelationship otherwise potentially inferred among assorted facets under typical circumstance absent specified exclusion criteria restrictively limiting scope confining analysis rigorously contained narrow concentric boundary demarcating precise delineation exactitude defining definitive determination emanating undisputedly extracted logically extrapolated transparently thoroughly traversable linear pathway seamlessly connecting consecutive steps successively integrating pertinent elements harmoniously blending individually articulated segments synthetically generating methodical approach ultimately culminating cohesively unitified conclusive output systematically assembled hierarchically organized analytics meticulously deconstructed componentwise evaluated judiciously scrutinized exhaustively inspectingly interpreted holistically understood profoundl y perceiving depthfully nuanced subtlety underlying latent dynamics cautiously calibrating quantitative measurements accurately measuring magnitude carefully appraised accordingly adjusting factors proportionately responsively accommodating evolving context dynamically modularizing adaptability scalably optimizing outcome efficiently enhancing productivity significantly elevating performance remarkably maximally exploiting potential fully leveraging capabilities strateg",
        " varnish. Subtract these times together (from subtraction). To find out the difference per single painting when switching brands Lisa goes back into action identifying the additional amount needed per painting ((new_time minus older) equals [(older plus new) divided by two] or [(12 \u2013 7)/2]), which yields us three minutes so far . Multiply this result along with the quantity of artworks produced , meaning six [[three*six]. Round up if necessary]; finally you get eighteen. From here rounding off isn\u2019t required because our results aren\u2019t fractions hence we can state that eleven eight extra moments waiting around before getting through all those works without rushing them too thin! This way anyone reading may easily follow what happened behind your thinking walls thanks not having any math formula involved yet still managing well enough keep track everything stays intact during every decision process made throughout preparation stages leading until very first presentable piece delivered..

You can see here we used basic multiplication first because multiplying repeated groups directly shows us our \u2018grouping factor.\u2019 We identified what was staying constant (the amount being painted), grouped changes occurring over space (\\(\\text{$\\cdot$ quantity}$/), simplified any constants into single terms within parentheses while doing calculation inside those same groupings & finally evaluated expressions accordingly once calculated completely!
