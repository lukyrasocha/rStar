True or False? Justify your answer based on psychological research findings related to attachment behavior across different species including humans. [/INST]False. According to psychological research, imprinting doesn't refer solely to sexual attraction but encompasses various forms such as filial imprinting which typically describes rapid learning seen early in life when young animals form attachments to parents or figures soon after birth\u2014and can include human mothers too. An often cited example comes from Lorenz\u2019s study with geese, illustrating both 'sexual' and other types of bond formation through imprinting during their critical period right after hatching. Importantly, Konrad Lorenz demonstrated maternal instinct development among goslings using surrogate mother objects like cloth heads resembling goose mothers \u2013 showing not only sexually selective behaviors but also forming primary caregiver bonds without actual biological relations involved later in their lives. Therefore, while elements of these processes may inform sexual preferences under certain circumstances, it extends well beyond just influencing mate choice. Indeed, understanding the full scope involves comprehending cognitive ethology approaches regarding innate predispositions towards recognizing conspecifics (members belonging to one's own species), emotional regulation systems, social integration strategies, mimicry skills etc., found widely dispersed throughout animal kingdom demonstrating adaptability crucial for survival independent of reproduction implications tied closely to evolutionary theories outlined initially postulated by John Bowlby concerning childhood development.
