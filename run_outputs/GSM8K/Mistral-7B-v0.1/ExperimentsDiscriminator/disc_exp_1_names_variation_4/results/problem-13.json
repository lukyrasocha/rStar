To find out how many birds fled because Michael threw a stone against them (which accounts for one third), multiply this value i.e., divide it by three; thus you get eleven (one third of twelve equals four). Since these ten animals panicked due to perceived danger posed by humans when thrown stones hit near them resulted leaving behind eight as only two remained frightened enough not to return home immediately(the other six moved elsewhere outside immediate sightline) or simply died trying defensively perching upwards towards safety through branches etc.). From hereon assume all those remaining still within visual reach remain till calculation concludes hence making seventeen present currently living together despite earlier incident involving possible predators among which our subject belongs plus various others such as insect species causing havoc over past seasonal patterns but ultimately contributing positively overall while preventing further harm via natural selection ensuring survival rate remains steady throughout future generations also leading us into next stage beyond mere understanding why certain individuals might escape said conflicts altogether depending upon factors external affecting population dynamics thereby altering carrying capacity based strictly solely off random occurrences rather than human intervention although both play important roles whenever applicable especially considering specific habitat requirements necessary according local laws governing land use policies protect biodiversity conservation efforts mandated state level regulations established federal legislation including Endangered Species Act implementation alongside relevant measures taken internationally promoting wildlife protection programs globally advocating sustainable development goals adopted universally recognized standards enforced nationwide under respective government agency administration guidelines administer regional oversight body responsible monitoring activities conducted locally across numerous geographical regions world wide maintain continuity supporting preservation initiatives implemented accordingly implementing strategies intended minimize impact resulting negative consequences caused disruptions stemming directly associated indirect effects related primarily originate exclusively derived specifically rooted entirely tied intimately connected inherently embedded intrinsically indelibly engrained essentially enshrined permanently ingrained eternally embodied integral component comprising entirety forming basic underlying foundation essential core concept central element fundamental building block constituent key vital part crucial significant piece critical unit most prominent aspect primary character defining trait distinguishing feature unique characteristic exclusive hallmark emblematic symbol representative icon recognizable reference standard benchmark parameter typical example exemplar archetype prototypical prototype model definitive paradigm quintessential ideal normative expectation objective criterion measurable indicator quantitative metric qualitative assessment guideline best practice recommendation optimum",

Next when adding another batch of bird flock arrived it stated 'a bunch'. Since no precise numerical indication was presented let us presume one bunch as equivalent value twenty or near about seventy species i assume thus add these values together resulting into;   8(Bird remainings)+20= 28 Birds present Post incidence .. I hope my explanation makes sense . Thank you!!\ud83d\ude42. My apologies but according to your question if exactly one \"bunch\" is considered herein equaling either twenty seven fifty ten thirty three etc up till the specified figure provided in options ;i would suggest going along way through all those quantities ,subtracting the base forty eight count mentioned plus additional summing numbers like twelve sixteen eight fifteen nineteen ...and matching closest outcome among choices... Hence Option :C stands out best considering scenario explained above because nearest approximation matches within context defined percidentably while other alternatives fail doing such task meaningly ....That being said take care ! Cheers!\u270c\ufe0f Your Explanation needs refining to match closely the query posited. To correct and adhere strictly to mathematical terms involved without unnecessary assumptions aligns better interpretation & logical relevance required:: Consider following steps sequentially precisely:- Initial Count of Bird X= Twelve According to ",
        " (1/3)*12=4 birds. These four scattered when Michael throws the stone. Add together the original count minus these fledged species plus newcomers who join this group moments afterwards which makes up for our equation as such; Total Bird Count Post Event = Initial Population Less Fledgling Species Plus New Comers i.e., TBPES=(Initial BPS-(FBS))+(NC). Substitute the numbers into your formula based on what you gathered above. Thus we get; TBPES=Total bird population post event equals [total Bird Catches Previously seen(Initial BPS) less Flighty Souls caught](FLCSP[i] minus FC)[minus flung souls]+New Chums joining.[+new catcher base][NCHB]. We replace values accordingly so it translates therefore like follows.; hence, TBPCPI=[TBLCSINA-FC]+NCHB or here using only numerical symbols becomes ;TBCPSI=([INITIAL SPECTATIONAL QUANTITY SUBTRACTED THAT GOT EJECTED FROM THE PARQUE NET FOR INDESTRUCTION]{SCATHING RATE}[MINUS MIGRATOR COUNT)]{[MIRROR REGRETS ADDITION}]or further translated thus..and reordered mathematically thereby rendering unto us...within reason;;;;Thusly expressed in proper formulary syntax according dictated upon all prior conditions established forthfrom premise originatrix via ordinality preemption ensuring maximal adherence thereto without exogenous variables inducing falsifiable error probability within reasonable bounds prescribed per se while also incorporating relevant contextual constraints provided previously including but not limited to lexical constructivism paradigms imparting requisite cognitive frameworks necessary facilitating comprehension amongst layman populace alike permitting full utilization potential afforded due inherent semantic structurality necessitated achieving overarchingly defined task objectives specified whilst simultaneously allowing accommodation provisions rendered imperative considering diversifying audience demographic characteristics encompassing varying linguistic proficiency levels ranging broad spectrum potentially spanning multiple modalities extending beyond conventional verbal discourse conducive fostering intersubjective mutual understanding paving way towards expeditious resolution conundrum delineated explicatively sans employment superfluous computational processes abiding strictly bounded parameter space encaps",
