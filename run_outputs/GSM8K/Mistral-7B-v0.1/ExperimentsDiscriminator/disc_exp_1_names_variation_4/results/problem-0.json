        " '60 meters per sprint'. To find out how far he ran during all sessions combined; calculate what occurs over three different instances (the Monday/Tuesday/Wednesday running). Since we know that these events occur thrice ('each Tuesday'), therefore multiply your previous result accordingly i.e., 60 metres (for just one) multiplied with both sixes (number of occurrences as well as repetitions), ending up being forty eight ((or thirty) miles instead if you want! ). That means when combining distances together throughout multiple iterations\u2014you can utilize multiplication strategically [using it correctly here] because although individual actions contribute individually towards accumulation \u2013 their overall contribution becomes significant only collectively ; thus making accurate measurement pivotal .

Find the total distance covered every single day through multiplying both daily sessions (`days`) with `session`: `(number_of_people) * (distances/person)` . Thus we get; `[total_daily=((no_times)(total_in_one))]= ((3)*(180))` or `(total_daily)= <<(3*(180))=(540)>>(540) m `. Lastly find out what happens over time via multiplication:`[weekend] weeks[(totaldaily)]`; therefore multiply number of workouts per day(`days`), i.e., three running sets a week and amount ran during said set ; hence our solution becomes: `(finalsum)=(weeks)*(workoutamounthoursevendays)`. This yields us : `final sum =   (3*540)`, Or finally obtaining , `(finalsum)=<<(3*540)=1620>>(1620)[meters]`.
