And finally just add them both together once divided equally among everyone else trying out this game--so maybe something like sixty thousand??? But actually looking back into previous answers...they show different numbers involved because neither person can count exactly using fractional divisions anyway without doing math too complexly myself :( I suppose these things aren\u2018t really meant either way until someone comes along who knows better than me right?? Anyway might as well stick wih whatever seems most reasonable given our present situation thus hopefully satisfying all interested parties:) It definitely makes sense why folks would argue over certain figures though considering none seem especially logical unless absolutely necessary(though perhaps explaining yourself quite clearly helps explain further?) Or if not necessarily essential itself may serve useful purpose while seeking consensus amidst varying interpretations---makes perfect kinda logic sounds fun :) Oh but wait oh sorry guess Im being carried away somehow....haha Okay fine no matter nothing ever goes according perfectly every time even moreso cases involving actual people sometimes make sure stuff works properly whenever needed.(laughter)(imagine having multiple alternatives instead...)
