Since every bouquet includes 12 singular sunflowers; hence we can find out the total numbers of these dozen units through division. That means Daniel managed to deliver (56+26) worth of flowers into bundles or groups totalling 3 packages within just one working week without any excesses . It follows this formulae : ((Amount Earnings / Cost Per Item ) multiplied By Items Per Package). Hence , it shows us what amount(in whole dollar bills & coins), would suffice him being completely prepared with sufficient materials required for those batches mentioned earlier considering only full sales packaging possibilities exist here . Thus calculation becomes straightforward enough providing perfect insight as far dealing large quantities concerning commercial dealings goes unrequited thus helping ensure efficient utilization resources ensuring maximum production quotas achieved swiftly resulting overall reduction associated expenses including storage logistics transportation maintenance repairs etc..

Thus, each sold rose brings in not only its sale amount but also this extra value due to being part of a larger product ($2+$8/12), which totals up to approximately $(2+0.67)=$2.67 . Therefore, over three days he gets about ((5*2)+(14*2.67)*3=($10+(37.38))=$47.38 worth of roses. Since every pack contained six flowers, you divide this result by 2 or multiply these numbers instead by eight \u2014 because four rosa came out as twenty percent less than expected. It turns into just seven bushels altogether when working all things together properly. Because both figures needed need adjustment before adding them \u2013 namely factoring off those initial sales first , taking away double counting\u2014we come closer towards our desired quantity; however still remain short since such calculations involve indirect relationships!

Therefore over three days, Daniel managed to sell (13 single flowers) + (7 bouquets*12 individual flowers/bouquet)+(another set of 7 such sets)= [13+84+(7x12)]= ((13+84)/3). Thus we get ((13+84)*3)//3.=((97)*3)//3.= (291) //3.\r",

        " every bouquet. This information tells us that each bouquet includes 12 sunflowers. We need to calculate the daily earnings made through sales. Calculate this amount by summing up both types of products sold daily which amounts to ($2 + $8)\u00d7 (number_of_sunflowers+$number_of_bouquets). To find out these numbers substitute values found earlier into equation above. Therefore we know our calculation would look something like follows:$10*(x+y)$=TotalDailyEarnings Where $X$ stands for number of units sold separately and Y represents Total Units Sold CollectivelyFrom data provided($10)((NumberOfBunches*$12)+(NumberOFSingleFlowers))$=$(TotalDaylyearning)-For Day OneTo reach solution you simply divide all variables collected throughout solving question by their monetary value.$[(Y/(1*costforone))+(X/priceforsingleflower)]=$[$((totalfromdayONE)/CostPerUnit),(totaldailyFROMDAYONCE\u00f7PricePerunit))]Calculations Follow Next steps below.*Step1-$Identifying Unit Prices From Data Provided:-Prices Are Given As Below -> Cost Of Single Sunflower->$2 :- Price OF Each Bouquet Containing 12 Flowering Petals or Singlesunflowers-> $8$- No Information Is Gave Or Required By Problem Statement And Can Be IgnoredWhen Plugged INTO Daily Earninng EquationWe Get Following OutputAs Observed Every Element Needs An Attribution ThatIs Done Through Using Certain VariablesWhich Here Will Represent Specific ItemsIn First Step It Says Find Numberoftotalunits sold collectively Which Means Finding TOTALNUMBEROFSONIFLOWERS&BOUQUETSOUTPUTWILL BE LIKE THISExample--> [([[TotalflowerschouldbedividedByOne],[Totabouchurosshouldbeword]][[[FrtalflowerschouldbetdividedeveryElementbyTwelveandthenaddtothreeselement]]],So Final"
