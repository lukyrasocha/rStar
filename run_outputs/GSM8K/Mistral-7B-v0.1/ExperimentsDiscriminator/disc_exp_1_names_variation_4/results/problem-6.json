Here our units represent individual prices which simplifies calculation, so instead use simple numbers like hundred bucks or whatever makes sense if this was not homework problem -- let\u2019s go ahead using hundreds here \u2013 meaning every \u201chat\u201d equals one whole dollar! Since hats equal ten cents apiece\u2026multiplying both sides yields four \u2018hats,\u2019 henceforth translating into forty when converted back into dollars again...so finally putting everything together gets us downright elegant thanks partly because math allows those fancy manipulations mentioned previously but mostly bcqy clever ways allow combining similarities while keeping track carefully across variables involved without having lose sight wkdong stuff along way ;) . It turns out though no matter whether these things combined directly against themselves through multiplication before adding themtogether ultimately still ends up working perfectly fine provided none changes negatively during processing..i guess something special happens inside your brain just smack right next door whenever somebody tries really hard trying understand why certain answers seem counter intuitive maybe due purely accidental errors made either unintentionallyor simply plain forgetfulness(btw neither occur very often anyways).
