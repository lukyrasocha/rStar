Second formula represents another way to represent what the previous equation describes which makes your work easier later (`amountInMinutesThatShouldHaveBeenDryingWithNewVarnsisinOnOldOneByThisFactor` or similarly) : `differenceToCalculate=(newTimeSpentWaitTillEachFinishes(withnew)/old)=(lengthAtWichItTakeforone)(tobeDone) \u2013 ((aimlessLengthOfWhataYouActuallyDo))`, third option implies doing everything manually until getting desired result--but I advise not stick too close because solving problems mathematically offers better experience along with less headaches during tests compared while calculating them numerically :) .
