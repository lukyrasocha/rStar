That leaves us defensive only having around 1/3rd the amount since it takes all remaining amounts split evenly amongst the others i.e., 52/(3xDefensive Players). To make math easy we want pure whole numbers here so instead use multiplication factoring out multipliers across categories ie multiply both sides of equation respectively but first get rid of initial values removing any extras like those not needed eg add together opposites or remove common factors etc... We can reduce further simplifying this down until eventually arriving upon smallest viable set without decimals resulting below example shows steps along way till finally ending result reached..

        " states there are twice as many players on the offense than defense. Divide this value (the identified number) into three parts because it represents three groups \u2014 offense(D), defense(E), special teams(F). Offense= D , Defense = E, Special Teams= F . Calculate first how many times greater the numbers representing these categories would need to multiply individually before their sum equals whole membership of the club which amounts up totaled exactly 105. Start solving equations using factor pairs until you find those factors adding precisely equal your known quantity i.e., multiplying them together results directly back again adds/equals out to get original group size we\u2019re starting form here or our \u201cwhole\u201d.

        " defensive players can be calculated using this equation; D (defense) times 2 equals Offense(off). We already know Offense=52. Thus we substitute into our formula obtaining \u201cD*2=52\u201d which solves as follows, Divide both sides by \u20182\u2019 results in: D = 52/2 => Defense plays amount 'to': 26. Therefore if there was only one type of player playing throughout matches instead of multiple categories like defence or midfield etc., you would need less overall people due to fewer distinct positions needed per matchplay. Conclude your explanation concisely mention why having various roles within such sports enhances game variety but also requires larger rosters compared single position playstyle approaches thus increasing resource investment costs over time!
