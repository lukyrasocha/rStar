But still let me try something else considering possible errors along way\u2026 Assuming maybe somehow incorrect reasoning led towards thinking everyones situation might differ rather than seeing similarities shared even thought differences arose during solving problems thus explaining variance(if such exists), why wouldn\u2019t everyone simply calculate using sum percentages divided equally across either whole classes combined group totals OR alternatively subdivided up into separate groups like individual ones per student instead doing arbitrary division making things easier ? Anyhow going back onto previous line again assuming sums split down individually yet averaging results later yields slightly higher expectations compared previously calculated figures resulting possibly due increased accuracy seen thanks improved data points available leading toward better judgement calls involved too especially factoring impactful events happening simultaneously causing discrepancies observed throughout calculations furthermore reducing bias associated decision process required therefore becoming clearer regarding true outcome sought without undue influence affecting estimates derived upon original assumptions made initially although admittedly may appear unnecessarily complex however worthwhile attempting nonetheless : ) Okay sorry Im not sure Im confused but can someone explain clearly please Why am i wrong And could anyone suggest new approach Here s my attempt Take current scenario described involving calculating passing percentage requirement before continuing education coursework completion requirements within school district jurisdiction regulations under governing state laws applicable specifically related academic achievements standardized nationwide benchmark setting criteria developed through collaborative research studies conducted globally representing diverse perspectives including public opinions gathered via surveys distributed worldwide soliciting feedback participants submit online responses containing demographic information personal preferences interest areas educational background training experience job market preparation future career aspirations potential obstacles anticipated challenges faced while pursuing degrees post secondary schools collegiate universities technical institutes community tech college campus city area local municipality regional organization corporate enterprise small business cooperative association civic society chapter alliance umbrella membership federation league guild fraternity sorority study abroad program internship placement support office offering assistance locating opportunities applying skills learnt networking developing relationships building connections maintain strong professional relations establish successful careers navigating transition phases seeking employment",
