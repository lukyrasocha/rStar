Adding all four components totals us 39 (hat)+$117 (Jacket)+$78 (Jeans)= $234 .So ,the question asked about finding 'each' instead of adding altogether hence if u want the exact component part per unit than simply multiply the ratio amount i took calculated above by 1 ;For example lets say your company produces only 3 types of clothing thus making ratios : Hat=x Jacket=(y) Jeans=(z);you can use y/(x+y+z) % to identify individual percentage amounts correspondingly using multiplication against X value obtained previously [here its just being used individually]Thus resulting here would look like -->Total Price Per Unit Size:$234    HAT        ?     |      39            |   PURCHASEd Amount :[$234]*(.2)*[(2)/((2)+(3)+)]                      TotalPriceperUnitSize          ~~         approximately~~\r",

You can work this figure divided by two since we\u2019re finding averages , thus one pair equals half which totals up to 156 / 2 or 78. Adding all these figures results into unitary value .

To find out what the pants cost, we need first to calculate the average price which means adding up the prices before dividing them equally among themselves (cost_hat + cost_jacket) / 2. We know our values; this works like this => (39+117)/2=<<(39+117)/2=73>>73 . Finally, to get the whole value add all these items together : Cost per item summed equals (= ) Total Uniform cost Which sums up ($39+$117+$73)=$229 Dividend This method solves one problem using basic math steps including addition/subtraction multiplication division averages etc.. You can also solve if you use other ways such as writing equations or programming code but either way gets same result! So ultimately here\u2019s your solution\u200a\u2014\u2009Each Marching Band Member Will Get New Uniformes At An Overall Price Of $$229 All Right Thanks !!!

Total cost per uniform is the sum of all items: 39 (hat) + 117 (jacket) + 78 (pants) = 234 dollars. Therefore, each uniform costs $234. ",

Add them together first (.5*jacket_cost)+(.5*hat_cost), this equals ($117+$39)/2 which simplifies down to 156/2 or equal to $78. This result tells us if we combine our calculated values it would sum up to twice what one set of items normally costs when purchased individually before being cut in half again. Hence why calculating separately allows easier verification against individual item pricing standards; otherwise these ratios could lead towards incorrect conclusions especially during large scale orders like those involving hundreds upon thousands worth per order quantity totals common among certain businesses such music academies specializing mainly within performing arts field departments focusing around various instruments played & taught across several disciplines throughout educational levels spanning K through post secondary institutions alike along side numerous other facets associated wth student life activities relating directly back onto academic curriculum focused areas concerning creative media production topics etc.. Therefore instead simply multiplying quantities required initially just multiply numbers accordingly according specifically stated rates provided thereby allowing accurate calculation needed without any further mathematical manipulation aside perhaps adjustment factor considerations later possibly including shipping charges applied herein therefore keeping calculations strictly limited only toward direct purchase value basis unless specified differently elsewhere requiring additional work beyond basic addition formulae mentioned earlier henceforth proceeding sequentially following instructions carefully detailed subsequently below... However please note while doing computation errors may occur occasionally however accuracy generally maintained due careful attention paid reading entire question followed logical steps taken whenever computing results obtained using standard formulas commonly known amongst users preferring simple clear comprehensible answers over complex obscure ones resulting confusion sometimes arising particularly dealing intricate numerical problems often encountered via real world practical scenarios demanding precision level expected typical accountant professional taskings! Consequently once completed review all data thoroughly ensuring no omissions occurred causing potential discrepancies leading erroneous outcome expectable under circumstances outlined thus described hopefully clarifying process utilized methodology employed alongside relevant variables involved providing sufficient details regarding approach adopted seeking precise conclusion desired ensuing effective resolution achieved meeting specific requirements sought ultimately resolving issue faced potentially uncommon situation found whilst working related subject area usually avoided handling regularly lack understanding necessary tackling similarly challenging computations frequently undertaken daily profession typically necessitating advanced training offered college courses covering varied technical subjects intended prepar"
