Altogether therefore considering all modes transportation available totaled , thus adding them results as follows ..

Here I use fractional parts instead of decimals because these numbers represent physical things i.e., students or machines etc.; however you may choose either decimal points notation (as long it represents integers since here only integer values make sense.)
