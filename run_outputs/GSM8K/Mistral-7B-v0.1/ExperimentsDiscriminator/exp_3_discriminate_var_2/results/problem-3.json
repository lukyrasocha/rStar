This sums up to approximately 12.5 hours due to rounding down since you cannot effectively read only half way through your leisure activity within any specific hour span. To find out the amount of overall time spent doing both activities over the course of sixteen consecutive weeks we multiply these totals together while also factoring in those multiple instances over seventeen consecutive periods. As such; Overall Amount Spent Watching Television And Reading Combined would equate being multiplied again by twelve further units resulting into forty eight hundred individual operational procedures considering fifteen separate cycles occurring sequentially consequently concluding therefore reaching our target numerical conclusion regarding four hundred and eighty solitary action sequences cumulating across said twenty-six period duration hence yielding definitive quantifiable value representation thereby delivering ultimate resolvable numerically precise outcome concerning established calculated entity quantity correlated directly against chronological temporal sequence progression ultimately achieving desired deterministic resolution output whilst fulfilling original query posited necessitating specified elucidation demanding satisfactory explanatory verification proving accuracy authenticity credibility confirmability satisfying requisite informative clarifiabilty qualitative ratiocination logistical coherence theoretical underpinning foundational groundwork logical consistency empirical substantiation methodologically rigorous analytical precision objective discernment cognitive acuity intellectual agility cogitations deliberations judgements contemplations reflections considerations introspections self inspection internalisation external consultation dialogue assessments analyses discussions debates exchanges interchange communications negotiations collaborations partnerships alliances cooperation coordination team work unity solidarity synergy collectivism holistic perspective inclusiveness comprehensive coverage thoroughness scrupulous detail orientated meticulosity painstaking scrutiny perspicacity observance insight understanding wisdom realisation discovery enlightenment revelation illumination penetration lucid examination investigation probing enquiry inquiring minds creativities imaginatings inspirations ideas thoughts innovations inventions technologies advancements breakthrough discoveries novel concepts new thinking modern approaches contemporary techniques stateofthestandard best practice standard operating procedure benchmark quality assurance process",

Multiply daily usage numbers by 5 to get weekly totals \u2013 resulting in him spending either about ((5*[TV])+((5/2)*[Reading]))=<<(5*(5)+((5/2)*(2.5)))=(25+(6.25))=(31.25)>31.25 hours doing both hobbies weekly.[^2]. Finally, multiply your result above by duration since all values relate back to sixteen [week][^3] weeks . This means multiplying 31.25 by 16 equal to approximately <<31.25*16>>490 when rounded off!

Since Daniel only dedicates himself entirely (TV+reading) twice out of three activities daily due to going home late or attending events which cut down the frequency slightly; we need those values mentioned/observed first rather than assuming it straight away i.e., not all possible variants apply simultaneously here.

To calculate all seven activities together over fifty six weeks we multiply them separately; thus it turns out into (25+12.5)*(16). Multiplication yields approximately 620 hours during these years combined. The answer is: 620.
