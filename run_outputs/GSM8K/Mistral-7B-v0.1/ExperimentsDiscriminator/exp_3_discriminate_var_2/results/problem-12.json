To apply the 7% off promotion charge multiply original prices ($70)*[7%]= [-$70]*[(7/100)] which equals $-4.9 or minus 4.9 when rounding up we get $4 since it reduces spending so subtract this amount from your previous expenses you had already estimated.[$70 \u2212 {$\u22124}] means add instead because amounts less than zero represent savings thus reducing what was expected initially spent resulting into the following calculation:$[${70}+{4}]=[{$74}],the correct way however might require just simply taking away ${4}.This may leave one wondering why adding makes better sense if saving isn\u2019t our goal here but let me try explaining\u2026 consider having exactly fifty cents plus no coins available; therefore without additional change needed \u2013 make use out everything including extras such as pennies & nickles etc..

Total cost before discount would therefore be (6*5)+(18*2)+(1*$20)+(1*$14) equaling $30+$36+$20+$14=$90 as subtotal without applying any sales taxes or additional charges. Calculate amount saved through purchase discount. Discount offered equals 7%. Therefore, calculation can look like this.$90*(7/100)$ which comes out to exactly $6.3 off so overall payment needed equates back downwards towards subsidized rate,$ thus bringing it closer than original expense calculated herein$. But remember we don't apply round figures while making payments but exact values when dealing mathematically! Hence considering above calculations & keeping them intact within confines; We get Final Amount To Be Paid By CHARLES=($90-$6.3)=$83.7 This implies finally paid becomes almost slightly lesser due todays savings thanks only partly courtesy marketplace mechanisms itself having built certain margins over time thereby earning profit margin based upon consumers\u2019 purchases \u2013 hence indirect yet appreciable contribution made too..so saying ends up telling us clearly quite nicely right:) .and since its pretty good turn even though reduced compared previosely estimated value post said reductions effectuated wtdour immediate understanding needs clarity&confirmations also ;D Cheers folks!!!
