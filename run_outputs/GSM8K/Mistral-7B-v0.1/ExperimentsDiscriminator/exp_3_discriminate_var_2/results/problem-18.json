All I could deduce was if someone wants/needs X amount as being successful across multiple trials which means simply setting equalities when combined together :) ... but let us assume what people meant by 'particularly good results!' :D Anyway just imagine trying both scenarios yourself using pen & paper before deciding upon anything because otherwise misunderstandings may happen sometimes!! Or better yet try testing those against different types o data sets too see whether their behavioural patterns seem consistent enough compared wrt expected vs observed values etc.. Also feel free asking further clarifications whenever needed since misinterpretations occur quite frequently around topics dealing heavily under probability theory so never hesitate seeking such guidance:) As far concerning understanding concepts thoroughly go ahead exploring available literature materials online / library books written solely about statistical methods applied mathematics including binomial distributions hence helping prevent possible errors occurring while solving real life problems involving numerical calculations accurately!!! Finally remember always verifying assumptions made during analyses prior conduct actual experiments ;) Best wishes learning related stuff though!...and no worries guys these things only matter very little over time especially considering long term benefits gained once learned everything properly without having doubt doubts raised due mistakes caused via careless actions causing unnecessary stress thereby prolonging recovery times thus hindering progress moving forward....haha Okay seriously however despite my earlier attempts providing appropriate explanation perhaps explaining simpler terms might help improve comprehension therefore please bear patience allowing me another opportunity sharing detailed insights regarding mentioned queries~good luck everyone !!
