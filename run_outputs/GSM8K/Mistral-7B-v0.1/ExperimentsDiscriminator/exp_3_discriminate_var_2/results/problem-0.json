Hence, we can conclude that Steven completes  2700 metres everyweek if he continues this training pattern continuously without any interruption or rest period throughout. This calculation assumes no time taken either due warm up before starting the actual main part/run nor cooling down post finishes as well , i.e., it considers only active running duration including breaks within individual session but excludes these periods entirely while calculating overall distance covered over specific period like here considered across entire span termed as 'a week'.
