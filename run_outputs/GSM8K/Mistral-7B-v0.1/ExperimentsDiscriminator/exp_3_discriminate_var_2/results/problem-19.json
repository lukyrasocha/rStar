To find out exactly what percentage change or increase happens here you\u2019ll need calculate Change/Old value X 100% .

But since we already determined above what speed these faster sheets make up against those slow down your work rate; namely sixteen(half)-minute intervals or approximately twelve additional quarter hour periods until complete coverage occurs--i therefore conclude .that while increasing efficiency may shorten individual job completion timelines via reduced effort versus waiting idleness within single entities such situations become negligible once compared across larger groups due simply scaling benefits out proportionately according both mathematical logic AND real life observations regarding similar processes like baking cakes quickly enough together vs individually etc..

With these factors mentioned above together let us calculate difference which can simply equate back into hours considering both scenarios over same lengthy period.. But here instead i calculated directly because question asked 'how much faster/more than usual current situation'. This means comparing different rates rather calculating differences within identical or common situations. Thus first find out average speed increase rate due changes made : From previous experience based upon our observations ,we found increased overall delay caused through application twice(or other reasons like weather / environment etc.) . We compare them against their initial levels before change took place thus taking higher variance level downwards towards baseline value while still accounting possible external effectiveness variations along range not present during original setting circumstances .. Which lead me derive following equation below:: [(New Level)/Original Value] -(Time saved )=Extra Time Added Per Unit Effectively Impacting Result Due To Adjustment Factor Implemented Today ;where New Variable denotes newly introduced factor causing larger delays even amongst lesser volume usage patterns whereas Old Parameter refers constant measurement basis previously employed throughout operation span till date keeping record maintenance integrity intact despite lacklustre performance resulting post amendments implemented recently.....
