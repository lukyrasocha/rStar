Next recall we learned about subtraction through division (fractional removal). With three parts represented by fractions here ('one fourth,' \u2018a third\u2019), subtract these fractional portions successively using arithmetic operations i.e., multiplication followed quickly afterwards by another series reduction via integer type calculation(integer operation refers back into whole quantities since partial units/portions cannot exist physically): From totality calculate one fourth portion removed (`initial_removed`), expressed mathematically below like so:` initial_removed=(1//4)*total_start_pieces` which outputs numerically equals `9440*0.25`, thus rendering quantity equivalent to exactly 2360. To discover amount post removals apply said output unto origin total excluding already reduced piece count thereby yielding adjustment resultant called new total (`new_total`).
