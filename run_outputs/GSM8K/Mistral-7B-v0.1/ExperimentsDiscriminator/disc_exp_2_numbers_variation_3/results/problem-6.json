We identify the combined value of all clothing items prior performing this calculation; because these values won\u2019t change once calculated individually.

Adding those numbers tells you which combination method best matches your desired output!

This means finding their combined prices ($142+$426) divided by the quantity; since this equation contains only the one pair [hat+jacket], divide them by its count, i.e., 2 ((mean)=($142+$426)/(2)). Hence, both amounts come out equal to halfway toward the sum, or $(568/2). Calculate the full price per ensemble piece adding together all the elements [(hat)+[jacket]+[(pants)]]. We know every single component separately but need addition (+): $142+(total jacket)*2+((mean))*. To get totals, perform multiplications ([jacket]*2=[$426*2] & [pants]=[$568]).
