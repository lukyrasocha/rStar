Therefore, if three kangaroos together cover any distance within 28 hours (at speed \u2018k\u2019), then one kangaroo alone covering twice as long duration working at double effort could also handle the task since the work performed equals productivity times time worked over individual capacity [(one_capacity)\u00d7(time)=(three_capacities)\u00d7(overall timing)]). That means when these kangaroos covered the whole terrain individually using equal parts of efforts during different periods \u2013 [one part goes directly through air while rest piles up behind him slowly] resulting in them taking exactly equivalent intervals combined altogether; consequently dividing equally among themselves allows us calculating just simply enough!
