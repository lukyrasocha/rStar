Here again...we divide according too..so take 2x(86), thus multiplying everything except variables including constants themselves within parentheses instead dividing later because when doing subtractions prior already known quantities become obvious but still unknown variables remain intact unless stated otherwise during multiplication itself....For example if say y was less than z plus w ,then simply subtract c without worry about adding additional terms beyond 'a'.

And voila you can see our results matching above .... Therefore we achieve Total Unit Wear Price Here!!     Exact ",
        " (86+258)/2=172. Add all up \u2013 you get your final price : 86+258+172= 516 . The answer is: 516.",
        " therefore takes up most space; if you add together all those numbers (that being only one item per person) this works out to about twice the price of just wearing regular clothes or having none, making sure people feel like part of their team rather than individual walkabout souls wandering around wherever the mood strikes them when outside during games and other events related to competition involving our school\u2019s athletic teams). However due because things need replacing every year anyway unless your equipment last forever even though very expensive comparedto normal clothings hence why high priced clothing brands still sell well especially ones market themselves heavily towards sporty kids(which happen often enough since nearly everybody who plays sports growsup quickly!)..but remember budget accordingly too..the extravagant look can wait till college/university studies begin proper etc...and maybe not buy any nice shirts while young anymore until something decent happens financially downstream otherwise\u2026youll regret spending hundreds upon hundreds right away.....unless u absolutely love designer wear....then go ahead!! Good luck!...anyway back tracking somewhat perhaps its wise herein provided information prior explanation might aid better appreciation understanding above mentioned points regarding importance placedo certain items considered necessities important beyond mere superficial reasons thus hopefully informative insightful thoughts shared relatable useful info within context explained beforehand also thanks reading sharing experience learning valuable lesson gained throughout entire journey life itself always offers surprises opportunities waiting discovery moments coming along path never ending adventure seeking knowledge treasures hidden behind clouds mysteries unlock doors revealing truth secrets unknown previously kept concealed deep inside heart minds feelings emotions buried beneath surface seemingly plain yet holding powerful magic transform ordinary lives into extraordinary realms reality fantasy world fairytales magical tales incredible stories captivate imaginations hearts warming soul enrichment spiritual growth experiences cultivating personal development self improvement health care quality nutrition fitness exercise strength training workouts building muscle bulk gain body shape transformation weight loss programs reducing caloric intake increasing metabolism speed improving cardiovascular system function efficiency physical performance output potential productivity energy levels maximizing focus concentration mental clarity eliminating distractions concentrated study skills memory retention recall ability long term strategic thinking planning problem solving analytical reasoning creative innovation critical evaluation synthesis comprehensive research summarization effective communication public speaking presentation delivery articulateness verbal expression vocabulary language fluency conversational skills interpersonal relationships networking professional",
        " the hat so it would be (3*86) = 258 dollars. Pants cost the same amount as the average price of the Hat and Jacket which means ((86+258)/2)= 172 dollar . To get the sum we need to add them up : 86+258=344 , thus taking into account this last element you finally obtain(Sum)(TotalCostUniform)=  344+172= 516 therefore each uniform totals   516/NumberOfUniformsToBeBought.(Total CostPer Uniform ) or simply dividing our first result since all uniforms received same items:(516/numberofuniformstobeordered). This was just considering the item prices above without taxes if no other fees like shipping charges existed..the formula could change accordingly; however these values remain unchanged otherwise! ",
        " dollars. Pants cost the average amount between hats (86) and jackets (258), so their price would be (86+258)/2 = 147 dollars. To find out the whole value you sum up all these amounts; namely, 86(hats)+258(jackets)+147(pants). That sums upto **501** dollars per complete ensemble or uniform! ",
        " hat and jacket prices, so (86 + 258) / 2 = 172 dollars. To find the total uniform cost, add up these items: 86(hat) + 258(jacket) + 172(pants). This totals to 516 dollars per set of clothing including hats & pants but no coats/uniform sets or packaging fees stated. It would appear this question requires additional details about what constitutes a 'set'. Current answers assume everything together equals one unit regardless if we don\u2019t account bundles specifically mentioned. Without further specification it cannot accurately calculate individual item price within defined bundle categories because their specific quantities aren't provided either nor whether pricing varies upon quantity purchased etc., hence ambiguity arises rendering current calculations incomplete without extra information needed defining exactly included components making full ensemble sold under single transaction offering standardized quoted amount only potentially misleading readers seeking granular detail breakdown unless explicitly understood context implies such overarching sums represent intended purchases inclusively rather isolated separate garment transactions individually calculated separately considering potential package discount structures applied generally across applicable product lines serviced thereby possibly explaining observed aggregate numbers listed thus assuming generic grouping convention typically practiced among similar retail entities operating comparable business models present case study scenario here illustrative educational example meant demonstrating principled understanding core subject matter presented doesn't necessarily mandate pinpoint precision level comprehensive exactitude expected especially absent explicit guidance regarding detailed categorization requirements expectational accuracy constraints limitability acknowledging importance clear communication fundamental maintain best interest client relationship ensure transparency mutual trust partnership vital foster collaborative solution focused dialogue address concerns proactively provide timely pertinent relevant accurate info facilitate informed decision aid resolution achieve optimal outcome beneficial stakeholders parties involved prioritizing fair exchange equitable deal terms satisfaction all concerned while adhering ethical professional standards conduct always uphold quality service offerings exceed customer expectation whenever possible establish reputable goodwill build long term value creating relationships based genuine care respect regard honesty integrity utmost high degree credibility earned consistently demonstrate reliability dependability strong work performance competitive edge advantage utilize expertise skills knowledge insights experiences valuable resources leveraged effectively maximizing efficiency effectiveness optimum results delivered every time deliver excellence outstanding success stories celebrated achieved celebratory events recognized globally industry recognised acclaimed highly regarded esteemed figures admired exemplary role model influ",
