This can thus be solved as follows; To solve problems such as these you need to understand relationships within them which include multiplication(in order to calculate totals or additive quantities based upon multiples). Here we know initially only one set consists of both shoe types combined therefore consider any single item here being equivalent to half their full price (divide initial cost over every unique element i.e., separate boots because if costs remain same regardless), apply said value thrice when considering items separately plus double all values since duplicate purchases occur during calculation hence obtaining correct result through addition.

Thus ''He pays'' can refer only to any parental entity here who happens to buy those shoes but since no other individual/entity name was provided its safe assumption could justly apply to him also hence when asked about what Matthews Paid i assume someone meant either Mathew himself (which makes most logical sense considering lacking info elsewise )or anyone playing double role , answering accordingly..

This translates as follows...Total amount spent ($)=N*$x$/$n$. Here n=$(pair^2$) since it costs \"$paired\" not $(price)$ . And if you see carefully one pair includes both right AND LEFT foot which implies that only half would count towards price. But still math uses entire thing instead including individual sole portion because usually people don\u2019t consider those separate components when computing purchase amounts like fashion stores or others. Since here though its doubled regardless ...therefore......And Price Paid=(No.$Paired^{Pricing}$)/$(Price)^{no}$. Which basically just says your spending depends upon what unit u choose either complete item wholly included OR component parts such soles alone & even without further breaking down into fractional sizes etc ....Which makes sense intuitively especially wrt large quantities needed simultaneously , cuz no single entity really matters nor small bits individually anymore but rather collective bulk value considering potential differences among various models available during sale events ; Some may offer larger discount rates accordingly causing change within calculation formula used above dependingupon particular circumstances present during time period requested ..!

We can see here first part (Number of Pairs) goes into our numerical expression as multiplier or denominator when calculating unit rate; second part determines what units those numbers represent(in other words value), thus serving purpose of numerator. Hence appropriate choice would lie under Option B because calculation requires use both division/unitrate aspect represented through 'each'. Options remain options only post discarding unsuitable ones till selection becomes clear based upon above reasoning applied towards solving problem statement provided initially asked regarding quantities purchased versus pricing information available visibly linked together contextually thereby eliminating remaining irrelevant responses systematically leaving correct solution among potential alternatives highlighting significance placed directly against mathematical operation necessity aligning within logical boundary limits set forth prior explanation stages concluded subsequently reaching resolution point satisfyingly matching expectations held accountable via established protocol ensuring accuracy fulfillment desired outcome achieved congruently maintaining standard upheld consistency across multiple platforms adherent regulations compliant ruleset encompassing applicable law directives mandated oversight procedures monitoring practices verifiable tracking measures preventive safeguards effectuating responsible reporting integrity preservation validity guarantee authentic confirmation certainty assured certification granted legitimacy recognized credibility acknowledged reliability trustworthy dependability confirmed affirmatively accepted accordingly submitted truthfully factual genuine accurately stated realistically plausible justifiably vetted attested corroborated substantiated supported well founded rationalized explained understood comprehended agreed consented appreciated thankful respectful appreciative admired honored celebrated reverent praised acclaimed recognizable widely known commonly shared mutually understanding interdependent relationships fostering harmonious synergy collaborative partnership beneficial productive positive progress optimistic forward looking hope inspiring motivational driving force propelling momentum building dynamic energizing catalyst revolutionary innovative transformative transcending beyond conventional boundaries redefining paradigms exploring frontier discoveries pioneering cutting edge advancements paving new ways forward breaking ground shattering glass ceilings achieving success milestones accomplished goals realized dreams materialize possibilities unfold opportunities becoming reality actualization making happen tangible intangible converting vision thoughts ideas concepts realizations action results accomplishments outcomes deliverables performance metrics output efficiency production quality satisfaction customer experience happiness joy delight pleasure enjoy fun entertainment amusement diversion recreation leisure activities relax time free moments peace tranquility calm serenity",

Thus if both Pauline purchases four single dollar tickets instead of doubled up prices within a family pass system; Mary Anne\u2019s expense decreases accordingly. We can solve our problem using simple subtraction here too though! As everyone starts off equally charged due only having purchased regular priced admission versus taking advantage through any lower rates possible via group discount offers such as those often available when families visit theme parks together \u2013 whether directly paid entry fees go towards overall savings made during trip planning process etc . However since no specific info provided relieving concern over either possibility being true nor suggesting anything about sharing among friends or relatives outside immediate kinship circles\u2026we still assume standard ticket price applies throughout entire gathering without further complication introduced thus resulting equation looking something like below : Price_Tickets*Number_Of_Adults+(Price)*(Each Adult Child)\u2212Cost Family Pass).

        " that it costs $42 per shoe (the unit price). Since we want to know what you spend when purchasing both feet together ($i.e.$pair), multiply this figure by 2 again which makes it equal to $84 [$42*2]. This means the amount spent would double if buyers wishing purchase these items need their own shoes as well like parents might do so here [in order to see him walking comfortably rather than run around barefoot], since all individuals within every family require them equally regardless whether or not someone else also needs/uses said item(here 'shoes') . Therefore our conclusion about amounts paid altogether cannot simply mean just multiplying single quantities because other people may consume similar but different goods concurrently hence why I mention above point being considered necessary especially dealing intimately personalized relationships involving such cases often occurring whenever anyone attempts calculating consumption amongst members directly associated closely emotionally spiritually etc., thereby emphasizing further importance understanding contextual factors beyond purely statistical figures alone before arriving definitive determinations regarding actual monetary expenditure overall during transactions among those who share close familial bonds typically including marital couples along side parental units themselves sharing physical proximity through cohabitation thus requiring additional accountancy work ahead towards achieving accurate assessments concerning dollar values actually disbursed over time period related specifically designated purpose serving special interests relating distinctively particular persons individually known collectivistically referred terms commonly called household heads referring explicitly indicating primary manners individual behavior patterns employed while performing functions representative duties assigned via domestic environments setting forth various economic principles governing exchange system structures organized primarily upon basis premised sole accordantly shared mutually agreed consensus ensuring equitable distribution fairness throughout entire network community comprising families grouped under category labelled societal construct term identifying group relationship status established social hierarchical organization operating based hierarchy ranked according relative priority assignable across varying strata levels representing differing roles held position respective office occupied person holding title designation entitled post grant assigning authority level controlling delegated responsibility taking full ownership owning decision making process exercising ultimate control direct supervision monitoring performance evaluation reporting outcomes produced achieved tasks accomplished objectives fulfilled responsibilities completed successfully handled efficiently effectively managed appropriately allocated resources utilized optimizing output quality minimizing waste maximizing profitability potential revenue generation capacity promoting innovative strategies enhancing competitive advantage stimulating growth opportunities driving expansion initiatives encouraging development sustainment",

Hence, matrix multiplication isn\u2019t relevant here because it involves matrices (arrays) rather than simple numbers/operations like these ones discussed above. Therefore our approach uses elementary arithmetic addition & subtraction operations instead as indicated within contextually fitting situations presented through scenarios described earlier mentioned thus not requiring any additional complex mathematical techniques such as finding determinants(cofactors), inverse transformations or other intricate computations typically associated specifically exclusively mainly concerning linear algebra domain related calculations especially when referring solely based directly upon supplied narrative descriptions but primarily considering real life practical applications possibly involving multiple factors influencing outcome resolution processes potentially necessitating simpler computational methodologies aimed predominantly towards everyday use cases albeit whilst maintaining correctness ensuring clarity coherence throughout result interpretation proceedings etc whereas utilising appropriate simplification strategies wherever beneficial without detracting away substantial overall understanding comprehensive grasp surrounding involved underlying principles concepts fundamental foundational theories embracement essential basic knowledge required enabling adequate informed decision making capabilities optimal effectiveness productivity efficiency thereby facilitating successful implementation execution performance enhancement endeavours leading up ultimately achieving desired outcomes optimum results satisfactory completions objectives goals targets established initially intended fulfilled successfully accomplished fully completely attaining maximal satisfaction derived pleased contentment sense accomplishments achievements triumph victories glory success sweet victory huzzah hooray celebration joy elation happiness delight ecstasy bliss pleasure euphoria sensory pleasures pulsating thrill adrenaline rush excitement anticipation waiting impatience suspense nervous energy agitation nerves stress anxiety fear worry concern doubt hesitation uncertainty assurance confidence certainty sure proof verifiable evidence factual basis supported logically sound reasoning conclusive arguments validated substantiated proofs confirmed solidified concrete foundation backbone robust structure reliable dependable trustworthy proven tested verified corroborated authentic documentation original source material historical records firsthand accounts primary witness depositions testimony affidavits sworn statements official documents contract clauses written agreements legal filings administrative forms filled paperwork completed reports summarised statistics compiled figures calculated numerical values determined proportions percentages shares quotients products multiplications divisions remainders leftovers surplus accumulations deficits shortfalls gluts oversupplies excess inventories overstock depleted",

Since there are 2 sets of clothing needed for each kid ($42) multiplied by 2 parents equals $84 or $(42x2)=(84)$. Thus it means every family member paid equal amounts towards purchasing these items. Therefore you can simply divide this sum into half since one parent provided twice as much funds compared to another parent thus $(84/2)=$42$. This tells us individually what was contributed toward shoe expenditures alone before factoring tax returns which aren\u2019t addressed within question boundaries hence assuming non applicable rates hereafter simplifies computations down only involving principal figures involved thereby arriving upon our solution easily .
