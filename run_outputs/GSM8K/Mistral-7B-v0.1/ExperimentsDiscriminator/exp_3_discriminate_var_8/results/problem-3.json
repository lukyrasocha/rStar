We start off considering ten instances since here its mentioned 'times'. That would mean (4+4)/2*10= 8x10 Which means Antyons daily consumption amounts up to 8hours which needs dividing into seventy percent or almost seven full workdays ((tentatively assuming twelve working hrs./day)):That sums upto thirty nines iirc.. But im not sure... Anyways let me try my luck.... :) IMO Theres no definite formula yet just guesswork!! To solve such probabilities generally require understanding various factors like availability & duration of resources consumed etc! It sounds rather challenging but fun nonetheless:) ",
        " first question using our calculation above which was him sleeping and doing other activities (hence excluding just television). We know he sleeps and/or takes part in other routine daily actions every single day aside from Monday when not stated otherwise; therefore it would mean all six hour sessions take place over seven different calendar periods across one week. Multiplying them together gets us these results:  6 * 7=<<6*7=42>>42 . Calculate what happens if you multiply those numbers twice since only told about activity during eleven outlets (a simple doubling) \u2013 so ultimately both calculations become very easy! Here\u2019s another way around finding exactly doubled value through subtraction instead\u2026 subtract any previous totals such like \u201cprevious\u201d values before entering into play again onto top amounts already calculated.. Simply add their respective differences back towards current base without counting repeats etc until finally arriving upon accurate answers!! Subtract once less because addition occurs while deducing prior amount yet remain constant till next round starts off fresh.(This method works similarly whenever adding something new!) Finally divide remainder obtained thus far even further downwards via division based equations involving factors beyond mere whole numbers alone:(e gx^y+z)/c Where X represents initial result achieved previously minus additional quantity involved later plus z% change percentage points apart equalizing sums eventually leaving behind fractional remains uncoverable solely within numerical context)(Dividing yields smaller integers whose multiples might lead right away toward solution(Additionally applying algebraic manipulation often required occasionally.)

Thus over eleven weeks it\u2019d amount to 42*11 =<<42*11=462>>462 hours spent either reading or watching television altogether. ",
        " Reading takes him 4 / 2 = <<4/2=2>>2 hours per episode. This amounts to 4 + 2 = <<4+2=6>>6 hours every evening (TV viewing plus time spent reading). Since Anthony repeats this daily schedule 5 times within one week, it means during one specific week, he would expend 6*5 = <<6*5=30>>30 hours engaged into either activities or both combined. Therefore over ten consecutive weeks which totals about fifteen three-week periods; if we calculate all together without taking breaks, you get  30*(11/3) ~<<calculation here>>~90 hours of collective participation across television broadcastings and literature reviews assuming constant activity levels throughout these months. Thus concluding Anthony commits roughly around ninety cumulative durations towards leisurely pursuits involving media consumption via televised content transmission alongside intellectual stimulation through literary engagement consistently applied intermittently over various temporal phases encompassing eleven sequential rotational cycles predicated upon triadic periodic intervals approximated under regular recurrent occurrence frameworks operative within specified duration parameters established according prevalent cyclical chronological structuring conventions typical within contextualized quantitative analytical methodology domain adherence guidelines inherent standard practice norm stipulated protocol execution sequences typically implemented universally ubiquitously amongst comparable scenarios otherwise identified accordingly following accepted recognized standards regulating procedure implementation criteria customarily employed specifically relevant primarily related directly pertinent respective analogous equivalents subsequently commonly acknowledged broadly recognised similarly generally agreed terms denoting general consensus particularly referencing common acceptance especially among those most familiar specialists experts authorities knowledge holders community practitioner peers professional colleagues associates academic circle members respected research institution scholars fellowship academicians society learned professors faculty university students graduate internships medical residents fellows nurses technologists lab assistants scientist doctor alumni clinician investigator postdoctoral fellow scholar student resident physician chief resident house officer attending surgeon registrar seniority rank staff grade level career stage next tier above junior counterpart immediate successor follow up replacement candidate applicant interview success audit report outcome measure effectiveness assessment efficiency review summary conclusion finding results result analysis discovery data investigation findings conclusions drawn evidence presented facts substantiated proof verification certified valid accredited qualified experienced credible reliable trustworthy depend",

Since these sessions take place daily too (and not just during one specific period), we multiply those same amounts together again: 2*5 equals 10 dedicated readings or hours spent actually reading over course of entire week. Therefore if Anthony repeats this pattern once every seven consecutive days throughout eleven non-overlapping periods \u2013which essentially constitutes twelve individual iterations across ten full cycles\u2013we can calculate totals accordingly; within one complete cycle alone including both viewing & absorbing literature activities results into exactly twenty combined workload accumulations summing upto eighty cumulative man-hours altogether(i.e., \\(2\\cdot\\)weekly duration \\(\\times \\text{numberofcycles})=20+20=\\boxed{40}\\)",

Consequently though these minor details wouldn\u2019t affect overall calculations regarding duration over periods such multiples months\u2014they would make them less accurate than desired if considering their potential impact upon human behavioral patterns like staying alert etc throughout varying timeline durations within any individual personality set framework\u2026but let me assure ye nonexistence hereof implies no change whatever concerning mentioned scenarios henceforth addressed below...

During one entire seven-day period, he therefore ends up devoting himself almost entirely to leisure activities; namely, over a whole weektime span, Anthony dedicates himself around altogether about fourteen extra hours dedicated toward entertainment besides work responsibilities\u2014exactly what modern living seems all too often come close bringing us nearer than usual!
