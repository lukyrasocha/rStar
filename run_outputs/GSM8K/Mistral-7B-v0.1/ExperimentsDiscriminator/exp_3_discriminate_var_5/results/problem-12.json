Since there\u2019s a sale going on, we need to calculate this amount minus their respective percentages off based on the item type.

Finally, adding up these amounts gets us your grand_totalsum : $36+24+$20+$12=(sum)$92.

To find what amount corresponds to 20%, divide the subtotal sum above ($110) times .2 equals approximately 22.
