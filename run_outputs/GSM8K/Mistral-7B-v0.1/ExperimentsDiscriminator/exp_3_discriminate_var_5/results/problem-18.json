Calculate the quantity required for passing using similar procedure described before but also remember we want exactly\u200963%, so your result needs correction \u2014 which requires addition/subtraction instead of multiplication here ; use substraction since our desired outcome was higher than achieved one previously calculated\u2009\u2014\u2009i.e., subtract current\u200a(\u200969.8%)\u200a\u2009from\u2009desired\u2003outcome\u2009\u200a\u2212\u200a\u202fthe difference\u200ais\u00a0around \u2212\u20096.2\u2030 (point something).
