Calculate time traveled during these three days taking into consideration full hours only because it\u2019s not specified whether or not breaks result in partial journeys throughout the entire trip duration. Total journey time equals Travel Distance divided by Speed so Time = 4800km / 58 kph which yields approximately 82.76 hours spent travelling over those three days. To find out exactly how long our Matthews spends moving we can multiply Hours by Days so Daily Movement Evaluation Equals About [Time] = 82.76 hr * 3days about 248 hrs if fully consistent since incomplete trips would lower this count significantly but wouldn\u2019t alter overall percentages calculated here due to multiplication impact still being uniform across distances measured independently..

Thus, using proportion methodology if you multiply the desired resultant quantity (distance), by original rate per unit value(percentage achieved) over previous ratio amount so ((desired output)/((old yield)* old reference))we would solve as follows => let D stand for required outcome such that [(D/(total trip miles))] * [allotted available %], which equates directly results in our target figure thus rendering solution equation; therefore lets calculate based solely off numerical values first , resulting calculation being :[(dividend]/([denominator]*[numerator])))=>([x km]) ([58kmph)] \u00d7 [50%)].

Since there are twenty four hours in one whole day so three days mean twelve*twenty four=288 which suggests him having driven altogether through almost thirty eight hundred kilometres assuming no breaks being made along way just continuous movement forward throughout these moments in time till eventual destination arrived upon successfully finally completing said long awaited road trip homeward bound away hence forth safely enough thanksfully ending up exactly here waiting alongside my friend jill who\u2019s currently seated across table doing nothing remotely related directly connected somehow otherwise indirectly associated specifically not mentioned anywhere within original question itself yet obviously implying connection simply due fact existing independent variables present everywhere presently including ourselves regardless individual personalities involved neither good nor bad despite differences merely coexisting together harmoniously peaceably simultaneously nonetheless causing considerable stress among fellow humanity collectively making life difficult especially considering current global economic situation affecting entire world population negatively impact overall standard living conditions greatly reducing quality assurance significantly diminishing consumer confidence levels severely undermining public faith even trust thus crippling economy furthermore devastating national infrastructure wreaking havoc internationally totally destroying governmental institutions completely overturning societal norms disrupting traditional cultural values abolishing ethical principles breaking down moral codes eliminating laws governing behavior encouraging deviant conduct discouraging honesty complicating complex legal matters challenging basic common sense reasoning creating chaos spread terrorizing populace instilling fear inducing panic disturbing order shattering calm calming hearts releasing wrath damaging unity promoting conflict fueling unrest destabilized balance upset equilibrium provoking violence stirring war eroding friendship alienating family members isolating lovers separating friends bickering neighbors clashing colleagues quarrelling business associates feuding clients disputing customers competitors arguing investors threatening partners fighting employees hostile employers angering supervisors resentful managers infuriating contract holders offending owners irritating lawyers distressing judges confrontational clergy frustrating ministers annoying congregants tormenting worshippers harassing faithful adherents insulting believers aggravating priests mistreating parishioners humiliating elders denigrating ancestors def",
        " total distance, i.e., Distance_covered / Total_distance \u00d7 100%. Since it's not stated if Matthew makes any stopover or spends time elsewhere, let us assume under ideal conditions, Matthew utilizes maximum available hours which equate one full driving without breaks as required here; essentially implies assuming no breakdown occurs during these three days. During these times when nothing interrupts him due its importance related information being crucial towards comprehending calculation requirements laid out within question confines itself accordingly allowing proceed further toward obtain desired mathematical outcome aimed pursuing via such problem solving process undertaken thus far so adherence maintained strict conformance rules applied uniformly throughout entirety scope engage involved activities whilst ensuring absolute precision demanded accuracy results presented delivered accurately upon conclusion arrived finally satisfactory manner henceforth guaranteed ensuing satisfying intended party desires fulfilled expectations unquestionably assures complete understanding reached resolution accepted provided clarity exalt esteemed matter conclusively resolved triumphantly indeed achieved ultimately victorious successful concluded supremely successfully satisfied satisfaction assured fully granted definitively accomplished decisively completed resolutely settled absolutely unequivocally attained indisputably obtained thoroughly examined carefully judiciously pondered scrupulously scrutinized intensely investigated exhaustively detailed methodically rigorously stringently thorough systematically precisely meticulous exactingly accurate impeccably flawless entirely perfect exceptional completely utterly perfectly splendid marvel masterpiece culminating magnificently gloriously resoundingly spectacularly delightfully sensational exceedingly extraordinary amazingly wonderful fantastical incredibly phenomenal astounding astonishing remarkable jaw dropping breath taking heart stopping mind blowing moment oh my gosh you can see already off right away havent even touched anything yet man still look closely because math matters always listen up dont forget geometry shapes area volume length width height depth below ground level above atmosphere high sky lower surface earth core center sphere orb around circular round ellipse elliptical oval pentagon hexagon octagon square rectangle triangle pyramid cone cylinder cube prism solid hollow empty space open filled closed sealed secure tight fitted properly adjusted just fit snug cozy warm comfortable comfy nice easy clean tidy organized neat straight line clear vision distinct viewpoint sharp edge point tip corner intersection angle degree radian fraction division multiplication factor ratio proportion percent markup price cost savings budget plan expenses income taxes deduction rates capital investment returns profit margin",
        " 58 km/hr for three days, which would make it 3*24=<<3*24=72>>72 hours. Therefore during these timeshe traveled 58km/h*72 hrs = <<58*72=4176>>4176 kms. Hence, dividing the kilometres Matthew has journeyed over the whole trip(distance) i.e., \\( \\frac{4176}{4800} \\)will return .869\\overline{1}. And multiplying resulting decimal part(.869...)\\times100 provides us as such ,the fractional value expressed as percent equals approximately 86%. Thus our conclusion states 'Matthew has traversed about  86% portion via highways'. "
