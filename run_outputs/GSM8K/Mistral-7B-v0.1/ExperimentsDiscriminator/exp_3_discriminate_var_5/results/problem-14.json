As every person involved here doesn\u2019t move independently but instead moves exactly likewise before anyone else starts their journey again immediately afterwards , therefore adding up those numbers yields roughly twenty seven seconds less overall duration spent traveling under similar conditions over equivalent distances regardless which organism traverses through said interval whilst accounting carefully toward relevant variables affecting human performance including possible fatigue effects imposed upon different types during certain activity levels throughout individual journeys taking into consideration multiple physical features unique characteristics associated specifically within our case study subjects namely age differences present among varying biological profiles available amongst living creatures engaged simultaneously performing specific tasks requiring significant attention directed towards accurate measurement techniques used subsequently incorporated respectively regarding assessment procedures employed subsequent implementation methods utilized further evaluation protocol established later followed closely ensuingly integrated seamlessly onto single coherent framework providing comprehensive analysis summarizing previously reported observations yield valuable insights beneficial ultimately informing future decision making processes related directly back unto operational aspects concerning safety measures implemented thereby ensuring optimal worker protection against potential hazards encountered working environment consisting primarily occupied areas often located near bodies water resulting exposure heightened significantly whenever weather changes occur rapidly due nature inherently unpredictable phenomenon always poses serious threat particularly experienced frequently observed worldwide especially considering global warming issue currently plaguing planet earth threatening numerous lives indirectly connected via mutual dependency relationships governing entire food chain systems influencing biodiversity impact adversely effect economy stability alike leading potentially catastrophic events if not mitigated accordingly promptly enough possibly causing severe repercussions beyond measure preventably altogether eliminated entirely provided timely action taken earlier saved countless souls tragically victimised presently still suffering loss grievously bearing witness horrendous tragedies unfold firsthand daily routinely regularly occurring happening too frequent actually already becoming ordinary routine mundane usual customary habit unfortunately hardly ever noticed anymore just mind numbing regularity indeed reality shockingly disturbing distressful devastating disaster yet nevertheless avoidable avoided successfully",

Henceforth, assuming linear scale efficiency without considering interspecies dynamics such as coordination challenges amongst multiple slow mollusks \u2013 though admittedly implausible within reality constraints yet theoretically permissible via simplification herein -- leads us to anticipate the trio requiring approximately twenty times less momentum generation cumulatively hence taking roughly sixteen minutes instead of sixty.

Three such tortoises working together therefore divide their work into Thirds resulting in only taking three fifth of its usual solo running hour rate thus leaving us needing them twice as Long...so we double our original required individual Tortoise Time hence yielding; four Fifth Hours overall which equals out to 18 when rounded off..
