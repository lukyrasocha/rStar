Using this method convert \u00bd into decimal form because it can easily create confusion among people who aren\u2019t fluent when dealing using algebra expressions like multiplying \u201chalf\u201d instead as say , \u201ddouble.\u201d Convert halves which equate simple arithmetic division operations such example being \u2018twice\u2019\u2014these always signifies addition whereas twice generally refers subtraction operation used frequently times daily especially during conversions involving currency rates .
