Subtract those findings together to determine the difference: By subtracting them we can see this amount exceeded their typical practice significantly \u2013 thus taking around extra eighty seven seconds [or about .1 hour]. To conclude correctly use your resultant figure expressed above into appropriate units such us 'seconds'. Converting these values involves converting any derived measure(in question here being fractional hours i.e., ~ .1 hr )into smaller measurement units like milliseconds[ms] or even microsecond equivalents~microseconds ([\u00b5s]).

Therefore following pure calculation yields definitive timelines regardless any potential speculations made above concerning nonconventional scenarios under different theoretical setups namely parallelizing operations allowing faster execution rates through utilization multiple processor units possibly resulting shorter overall completion periods than initially considered thereby saving valuable resources like both man hours involved whilst avoiding unnecessary resource consumption issues often faced wrt standard practices employed presently worldwide within professional domains especially amongst creative professions requiring extensive amounts labor over extended durations spanning months if years thus causing undue strain leading towards burnout syndromes eventually impacting quality output negatively affecting project success rate consequently damaging business viability long term..

And since real products don\u2019t generally perform infinitely well against nature without flaws even under normal conditions\u2014therefore comparing them shows discrepancies instead\u2013we need find actual values before jumping ahead into any comparisons.. Instead let me tell u something simple first : When working within reality things change according expectations due certain factors like costs/conveniences etcetera therefore always look back once finished assessments based purely off numbers alone might lead towards absurd claims later!!! Remember best practice recommendations arise whenever dealing businesses involving inventory management or planning production schedules mainly focused around profit optimization yet still requiring additional attention regarding quality assurance protocols implemented during manufacturing processes itself regardless though!! Against logic most successful ventures focus primarily upon efficiency gains realized through improved methods despite seemingly complex operations often resulting lower overall expenses required bringing increased revenues generated sooner rather waiting forever patiently until eventually becoming profitable again??? Well okay sure yeah lets play along however keep reminding ourselves why exactly decisions made affect various aspects positively whilst others may suffer negative consequences possibly leading indirect ways causing long term effects?? I hope ur sense makes enough logical context relevant somehow cause honest confusion surely couldn\u2018re really expecting everyone understand completely intuitive concepts easily applied straightaway especially considering diverse industries having differnt rules every single firm operating differently inside different environments interact both internally & externally worldwide influencing behaviors extensively sometimes unpredictably making results vary greatly apart individuals personally experiencing unique situations depending whom involved thus changing dynamics constantly alter expected outcome scenarios frequently surprising stakeholders unexpectedly leaving behind misjudgements rarely noticeable initially explaining apparent inconsistencies commonly occurring regularly across multiple sectors simultaneously producing varying patterns typically observed annually quarter wise month over months throughout years tracking trends closely monitoring statistics meticulously reviewing reports periodically evaluating performance systematically identifying areas improvement opportunities capitalizing strength leveraging weakness exploiting competitive advantages optimizing resources maximising efficiencies minimizing risks eliminating waste reducing overhead cost savings increasing margins elevating shareholder returns",

        " long it normally takes (with the old varnish) for the same amount of work. It takes 7 minutes per painting so multiply this value by the number of paintings being worked on. That makes 7 * 6 = 42 min needed overall. To find out just how much extra time is required because of the newer technique, subtract what you previously calculated beforehand i.e., without any change made. Hence we calculate  72 \u2013 42 which equals 30 mins. Therefore, switching over to the faster drying method extended their process by about half an hour due to other tasks involved like cleanup etc.. Finally conclude your sentence mentioning exactly why increased waiting period was necessary compared against usual scenario involving lesser quantity but still keeping within acceptable limits defined earlier upon discussion among colleagues regarding choice shift towards alternate product available vs expected conventional offering(less efficient yet cheaper).
