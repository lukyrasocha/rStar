To find out exactly 'what percentage saved', divide your saving amount over original sum $((($20-$19.1)/$20)*100)$ approximately equals ~4%. Therefore without rounding error but taking into consideration general mathematical operations used frequently especially regarding pricing adjustments, fractional values would actually result in exact decimal points making such precision less likely though technically possible due potentially having decimals repeating beyond shown numbers possibly reaching very long term sequences if extended too far hence approximation suffices generally except perhaps highly specialized situations needing extreme accuracy levels rarely typical outside scientific research scenarios requiring absolute computational integrity strictly adherence across fullest detail allowing no margins even negligible minimal variance within real world standard parameters.)

Here\u2019s our approach based on adding smaller amounts together rather than subtracting larger ones as might occur when trying to find differences in such extreme cases; thus demonstrating effective usage of both types of arithmetical operation according to your request while maintaining relevance since typical problems revolving around weights don't usually involve complex calculations suitable justification via multiplication or division without significant numerical input first established through other means like measurement scales or reference data points essential here being absent despite initial instructions suggesting otherwise.
