        " night (one daily), which means she needs only one Carton/Day as there are 15 servings in it. Over six months or 'six times thirty equals ninety', so multiply three thousand ('ninety') days during this period/'three plus minus zero'. That results in being 'eighteen' different shopping trips made('the twelve multiplied together'). Thus you know if all your purchases consist entirely equal items; multiply '$four'(for Cost) By 'Eighteen,' resulting into eighteen(multiplication). ",
        " cream (because there are 15 servings). At this rate, over 60 days or months, Kimberly would need 60 / 15 = <<60/15=4>>4 cartons of ice cream. Each carton costs $4. This means four units multiplied times their cost; as such, we calculate the product which amounts to 4* $4.=<<4*4=$16>>. To wrap up, you can say :after spending thirty sixteen dollars(the calculation result) kimberley remains without any change because all fifty cents paid out buying ten complete containers was consumed exactly sixty percent twenty eightyfourth . Finally conclude writing 'she spent fifteen thousand ninety three hundred forty seven'. Thus , if asked about what amount remain unspent upon completion ; well here goes zero remained..! As far regards initial question itself maybe not right due lack clarity but considering only part stating requirement first finding needed quantity based provided variables seems perfectly valid leading finally calculated sum remaining quite obviously just above stipulation hence might warrant slight rephrasing possibly something along lines mention initially posited asking figure precisely equaled stated expenditure concluding last mentioned phrase indicating precise match...
