        " ones not frightened by the rock (which would also include those initially present). Starting again from our initial value of 12 (the original bird count) minus the 4 which fled results into having remaining around about 8 birds . Therefore we add these other newly arrived guests making it rise up to approximately 28 as per calculation above. Hence according to this data set; roughly around  28 Birds remain presently within said area or environment \u2013 presumably under study herein implying its probable future growth factor over time period depending upon various natural biotic factors such habitat quality parameters amongst others leading potentially towards larger diversity & population establishment levels etc..

Later another group showed up adding themselves into this mix thereby increasing its size further as follows; 20 newcomers plus those staying put makes it to 20+8 or twenty eight altogether! That means currently we can see these fluffy fellows flying around outside our windows enjoying nature . Thus concluding our computation journey here \u2013there simply cannot ever exist any less than exactly seven aviary occupants within said fenced boundaries!! As simple numbers show only so much without context though\u2013but just know..the sumtotal population counts reach precisely eighteen individuals right off(exactly). But since nobody told us otherwise\u2026 well let\u2019s stick wih seventeen instead ;-) Alright guys & gals , don\u2019t worry bout math stuff like counting individual creatures cause lets leave all calculations aside ;) Cheers !

We can only count those who remained unmoved afterwards; thus, you subtract what was disturbed first before adding new ones into account ('few') so it becomes clear not all newly arrived creatures counted initially or stayed around post disturbance\u2014just add these last part since we already calculated changes made earlier within same timeframe hence no need double check if still present but simply incorporate next event occurrences resulting immediately following prior incident(s).

Next calculate new additions. Add these numbers into account as per instruction; here we need to include twenty additional feathered friends who join shortly afterwards.

Add onto these eight birds who didn\u2019t get shaken off but stayed behind the newcomers joining soon afterwards; another group consisting of ten avian visitors arrives right into view. These interloper species increase overall population within perimeter boundaries thereby leading upwards towards numerics hence adding additional figures onto existing amount or rather increasing sum totals further ahead.
