And going directly northward takes less time than eastward unless driving through Canada or Mexico first either case doesn=ts possible without actually making multiple changes per hour during transcontinental highway trips when crossing large parts o=r whole continents).

To find out if we actually need anything further converted before starting our computation operations based upon these respective figures, let us first identify whether or not any additional conversion factors might come handy just so as ensure accuracy when executing calculations related towards achieving said goal; however since both rates already exist within uniform measuring systems it seems unnecessary pertaining practical application purposes albeit worthwhile consideration nonetheless keeping mind possibility arising unexpected scenarios potentially necessitating recalibration process amidst such endeavours thus far noted consequently proceed onto subsequent numerical analysis steps accordingly while taking special note regarding precision levels expected throughout calculation journey henceforth forthwith commencing quantitative evaluation endeavor whilst abiding strictly adherent protocol dictated thereby established standard operating guidelines presented prior visibly depicted graphic representations exhibited subsequently therefore please begin processing requested mathematical computations following instructions specified previously clearly defined procedure described meticulously illustrated schematically delineated layout portrayed exemplary detailed illustrative methodologies employed demonstrably precise techniques applied uniformly across applicable contextually relevant scopes incorporating appropriate terminological specificity denoted adequately explicit lexicon encompassing requisite vocabulary essential indispensable acumen deemed critical proficiency absolutely pivotal ensuring utmost comprehension clarity paramount absolute understanding fully assimilate acquired insightful knowledge amalgamate conceptual principles elucidate complex theories simplify intricate dynamics distill essence discern subtle nuances extract salient insights analyze data evaluate hypotheses substantiate evidence validate conjectures infer implications extrapolate trends forecast future occurrences draw conclusions synthesize findings consolidate perspectives formulate recommendations articulate coherent arguments construct persuasive narratives craft compelling stories convey impactful messages inspire action motivate change foster collaboration cultivate relationships nurture partnerships build trust establish rapport strengthen bonds solidify connections create opportunities unlock potential realize possibilities harness innovations leverage assets optimize resources maximize productivity elevate performance enhance capabilities increase efficiencies streamline processes improve quality deliver results meet expectations exceed targets achieve goals accomplish objectives reach milestones overcome challenges navigate obstacles transcend barriers surmount hurdles def",
