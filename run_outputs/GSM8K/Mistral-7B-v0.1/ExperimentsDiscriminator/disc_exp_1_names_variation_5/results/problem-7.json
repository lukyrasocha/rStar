Total amount of cookies consumed by both during these two days equals 20 (Monday) plus 26 (Tuesday), which makes it equal to 20+26=46 cookies. Given one cookie contains twenty items worth of energy or 200 calories we can find out total consumption by multiplying quantity(number of objects taken)/quantity(number per pack).

Secondly multiply this figure by daily recommended intake equivalent value 'caloric_value', obtaining result being  18*200 equated to 3600 kcal . To get difference or superiority score calculated subtract smaller value from higher thus forming equation `nancy_Calories -- sarah_Calories` solving it renders us finding bigger integer part leading towards correct solution yield hence present differential stands represented numerically like so -> **difference**=`ans`. Therefore your request translates accurately herein mentioned numerical computation procedure yields following conclusive statement : Difference = nancy_Calories \u2013 sarah_Calories.

That makes Nancy eat 2 * 13 = 26 cookies. Find out the difference in their consumption. Overall; Firstly calculate what quantity of cookies Nancy consumed during both Mondays and Tuesdays combined. This sums up into 20(Mon)+26(Tue)=<<20+26=46>>46. Secondly take into consideration also the fact that this figure ought to consider all four occasions throughout Sunday through Wednesday. Hence summing these together results becomes 20(Mon)+26(Tue)+5(sun)+13(Wed). Sum it leads you towards making conclusion upon answering if anyone among them who took fewer or greater amount of food. Adding these values equals 64, meaning that altogether over three consecutive sunlight hours everyone put down exactly same size of pizzas inside mouth but nevertheless when comparing amounts taken individually clearly someone ended consuming larger portion! Finally divide those totals obtained beforehand thus getting answers regarding overall differences existing amongst individual portions shared/consumed respectively per person named hence concluding either one having lesser intake would equate lower output i f calculating average versus maximum possible rates based off observed quantities presented earlier while others possibly obtaining higher numbers being due lack certainty behind original calculations performed previously considering variability inherent within natural processes involved primarily involving digestion mechanisms typical occurrences found human physiology governing internal organs mainly consisting stomach acid along various hormones regulating hunger sensations experienced especially post mealtime situations dealing specifically surrounding daily dietary habits adopted accordingly suited personal preferences catering fitness plans set forth seeking wellbeing optimum levels maintained constantly despite minor variances potentially affecting long term consequences depending greatly subjective variables determined context related health states etc..

Analyzing such scenarios helps us understand personalized nutritional guidelines based not only on fixed quantities but also varying consumption behaviors among individuals.- One possible approach could involve comparing typical ranges or averages relevant to individual needs versus extremes caused by excessive choices like high carbohydrate content found in candies.(e., Twice as much.) Since different people may need distinct portions due to variations across demographics(diversity), it might indicate potential issues related to balanced meals including insufficient macro/micronutrient variety when someone disproportionately focuses primarily on sweet treats rather than holistic food habits.

This translates into another 26 * 200 = 5200 calories on Tuesday. Altogether over both days, Nancy therefore consumed a total of 4000 (Monday) + 5200 (Tuesday) = 9200 calories. Over these same couple of days period, Sarah only managed eat one dozen cookies altogether\u2014or six plus eleven \u2014so this made just under ten cookies overall; which equals about 10*200=2000 Calories worth! Hence we find that Nancy ingested exactly three thousand twenty hundred units beyond what was gorged upon by said lady bird across their respective consumption chronicles\u2026 We can conclude via simple subtraction such statement above would read \u201cNancy Ingested Three Thousand Two Hundred And Twenty Units More\u201d.
