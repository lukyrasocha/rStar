        " take him if he continued driving non-stop at this rate over three consecutive full days without stopping as follows; Time= Distance / Speed or T=D/R Using these values we calculate T=(6000)/(50)=120 hrs This means that when travelling continually throughout those three continuous straight forward days, Stephen covers exactly one quarter of the whole journey because Three times sixteen hours makes ninety six (=3*16). Therefore only 25% was completed. The remaining portion equals eighty percent [100-(percentage traveled)] Finally note not any extra information such as whether other factors could change either steves starting point location within alaska or texas but just plain simple calculation using basic arithmetic skills.. Hence our solution shows us clearly enough why % achieved cannot possibly exceed anything greater than equal parts less yet simultaneously fall below nothing being zero itself .

Since Steven only drives for three full consecutive days, we need find out fractional portion of whole journey completed as compared to overall trip duration i.e., `(time spent driving)/Total Duration`. Here 'total duration' considers also hourly rest times but since question didn't specify exact timings per break , here consider approximate value assuming constant daily operations hence roughly equal actual traveled distances & not just idle periods so let\u2019s go ahead calculating : Step 1 : First convert entire duration into same unit used earlier ie Hours; thus our calculated approximation becomes  5 Days multiplied by assumed 24 operation hours approximated per Day equals nearly 120 Hours exactly equivalent . Also note assumption made was every other period considered operational even during short snacky or bathroom trips !

Since stevan traveled as if going without stopping but takes breaks every few hour due to necessity such as rest or food consumption we can assume these break times equalled him driving about halfway through his drive(or less). We could say around one third since when averaged out its quite equivalent because taking frequent short stop along route makes longer trips similar timelinewise than those travelling nonstop.(and remember im not making any assumptions here just using data mentioned above)..

        " Therefore, across three days, Stefan could travel 150 km/day x 3 days = 450 km. To find out the percentage, divide the distance covered by Steven which is 450 km by the total distance between Alaska & Texas i.e.,  6000 km. This comes down to 450 / 6000 = .075 or simply said as 'out of every hundred units'. Since it means seven and half percent because if one unit equals ten hence seventy five becomes equal to twenty five but since its fifty only so adding together makes it thirty right..

Next, to find out the percentage of the journey completed, divide the distance Steve covered by the total distance it took him to go from Alaska to Texas which equates as follows; Percentage covered= (distance already covered / whole trip) \u00d7 100% Therefore, %covered=(450km(during three days)/ 6000km (trip))\u00d7100% Finally simplifying gets us%,percentage_travelled= ((450\u00f76000)x100%) Simplify further((9\u00f7120) x 100)=0.075~7.5%.

Hence steving covers out distraction about actual feasible journey duration related adjustments needed via break times & maintenance downtime allowing less efficient usage during last third period making overall performance lower possibly covering closer towards half way within same interval calculated i.e., nearly equitable completion not far off target yet remaining underway mark reached henceforth round off approximate calculation stands thus :   Percentage Covered => Travel Duration Required Till Point Steven Starts As % Of Total Journey Time Calculated Earlier To Achieve Goal Given Input Data Effortless Exercise Appropriate Translations Using Prescribed Format Thus ",
