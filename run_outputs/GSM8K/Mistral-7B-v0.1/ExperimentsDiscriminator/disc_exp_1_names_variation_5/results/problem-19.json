This shows us just how long Lisa waits before getting all six painted canvases fully varnished when compared against the original seven minute average per canvas finish point mentioned earlier\u2014here calculated as `'total extra wait'`=`numpaintings*dry_time_diff`; therefore our example evaluates such calculation like below--->>>>'extra waiting hours': numpainting*(old_variance+new_variance)/divisor Where divisor represents conversion rate i.e., if your standard measures was seconds instead you'd use its appropriate factor while converting into respective unit ('mins'). Thus calculating:`(6)*((7)+(12))/oneMinute`, equalling thus twenty eight times ten secs equal converted back results fifteen hundred plus three thousand four zero minus fifty makes twelve thirty one `(6)x=(5 min )`.

Thus 'it would take thirty minutes.' Therefore, the answer is:'It would take thirty minutes'.

This seems confusing because we aren\u2019t told anywhere else whether anything changes aside from simply saying 'newly introduced technique makes things go faster.' Here comes another point again regarding understanding instructions clearly before diving into complex math problems without fully assessing all necessary information first\u2026 That means no calculation just yet since nothing additional was shared either directly nor indirectly explaining circumstances outside general variance scenarios presented earlier while talking through possible strategies towards solving them differently considering context surrounding variables involved across various conditions/cases involving multiple inputs requiring manipulations etc., but overall idea remains constant thus making use simpler equations work better too!!! Again though keep reminding yourself prior steps may also yield similar results although simplified approaches might prove useful sometimes depending largely mostly case sensitivity among other factors worth analyzing deeply once reassessment occurs due changing environment requirements hence different solution paths possibly uncover hidden insights otherwise missed opportunities potentially leading us closer getting desired outcome efficiently utilizing resources effectively saving valuable amounts whenever possibl;; )=) As always remember basic principles guiding logic behind every situation---whether mathematical ones specifically dealing wiith quantitative data analysis tasks OR qualitatively examining patterns observed via graphic representations generated around certain phenomenons appearing frequently recurrences under specified parameters provided initially plus perhaps unexpected relationships forming emerging correlations further supporting conclusions reached thereby influencing decisionmaking processes accordingly impacting realworld applications applying theoretical knowledge learnt previously incorporated hereforth implementing practical implications derived eventually enhancing effectiveness obtained achieved successfully minimizing negative consequences arising occasionally resulting hopefully avoidable altogether......

Since we already know that applying conventional material requires approximately seven minute duration which equates towards little under forty seconds average interval between successive tasks including cleanup steps plus additional wait/cooldown period needed while waiting upon consecutive coats\u2019 completion), subtract those specific measurements once again so our calculations won't become too cumbersome nor error prone due excess verbiage; thus obtaining resultant summed values representing effective reduction relative rate timespan \u2013 eighty minus thirty four points equals fifty degrees Celsius less warmth during actual operation phase thereby implying twenty percent cooler conditions overall despite having similar output efficiency versus previous methods used previously mentioned within context provided throughout reading itself!
