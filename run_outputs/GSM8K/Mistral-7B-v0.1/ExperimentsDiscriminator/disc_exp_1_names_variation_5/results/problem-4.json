Ok fine lets get our math straight here :D First calculate using multiplication factors directly like above except instead doing fractional division use full decimals -> rounding may come later if desired too .. eg divide whole_number \u00f7 decimal => result rounded ???? ;-) Also note my parenthetical remarks earlier seem pointless unless specific numerical accuracy matters greatly; otherwise could probably simplify those sections further since no exact answers sought per se :) Note good old Euclidian geometry applies even among modern gaming scenarios ^^ ... ohh wait nevermind im assuming only basic arithmetic knowledge required due lack understanding regarding game concepts perhaps :-P Nonetheless hopefully provided useful overview nonetheless!! Thanks again friend LOL XD Great thinking however considering practicality alone maybe best stick simpler explanation next time possibly mention actual quantities involved etc rather than focusing excessively detail vs results especially whilst dealing wth potentially complex problems whose underlying rules themselves might necessitate prior study beyond mere surface mathematics haha Just checking real life applications would likely yield similar difficulties regardless knowing exactly steps involved hmm interesting speculation indeed thanks once more mate always glad someone helps navigate challenges alongside u folks keep pushing forward brainstorm innovative problem solvers !! :-) Cheers nxt reply looking positively eagerly upon seeing improvements incorporated INTO THAT POINT",
