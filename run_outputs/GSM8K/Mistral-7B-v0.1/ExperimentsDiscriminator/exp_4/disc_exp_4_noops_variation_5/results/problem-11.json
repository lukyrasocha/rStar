But this scenario assumes only one vehicle per employee which seems unlikely especially when traveling large distances such as across National Park Service boundaries.. Therefore what if multiple people shared seats within their assigned carrier system(bus/minibus etc.) ? To consider sharing space lets divide out available seated area proportionately among respective carriers keeping safety distance requirements intact thus effectively reducing overall passenger count : Bus Available Seats Reduced By Half::      Assuming half capacity occupied would mean around 30% reduction here since both width & length dimensions contribute significantly whereas percentage difference caused due solely increasing occupancy rate isn\u2019t significant enough compared against physical restriction limits imposed upon public mode transporters hence allowing maximum load bearing capability before hitting structural stress points .. Thus remaining passengers capable while using any form combination method including combinations involving alternate grouping techniques may well exceed current calculations made above considering human comfort levels typically adhere closely towards standard industry recommendations ensuring comfortable yet safe experience throughout entire journey duration . Here comes our solution !!! Proportional division yields about 75% lesser figures than previous result , therefore ~172 individuals able accommodate based off initial counts provided earlier excluding extra seat availabilities created through optimized strategies utilizing various methods described prior Note however assumptions regarding exact distribution pattern applied remains uncertain without further contextual details but expected range stays relatively close regardless Nonetheless following rules mentioned previously still stands valid providing optimum usage rates obtainable under circumstances specified thereby enabling additional headcount increases possible thanks ample allowance offered though simplified approaches employed Hence roughly speaking combining allocated capacities allows us approximate figure suggesting approx nearest round hundred plausible quantity suited fitting requirement sans detailed specific numerical breakdown required At least theoretically feasibly sufficient spaces remain post deduction even factoring potential crowding related discomfort elements accounted elsewhere possibly prevent excessive pressure build ups arising detrimental effects potentially trigger hazardous scenarios requiring immediate intervention",
