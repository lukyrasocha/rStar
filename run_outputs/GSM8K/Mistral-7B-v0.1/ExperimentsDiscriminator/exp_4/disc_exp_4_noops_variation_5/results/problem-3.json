Thus, when looking strictly considering numbers related directly tied back specifically towards what amounts onto books within these particular timelines presented throughout our calculations above; you would subtract another((x/8)/x)=one hour off due having fewer pages present inside said fictional stories versus conventional adult level works commonly available through libraries around town--and therefore resulting further downwards into negative values rather than simply adding them together .
