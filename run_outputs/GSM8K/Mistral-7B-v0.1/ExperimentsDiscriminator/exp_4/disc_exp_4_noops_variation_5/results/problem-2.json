According to the question, it\u2019s stated as half hour or `0.5` hours/dogs/day so multiply this value (`time spent`) against all these individual animals `(total_pets)`; i.e., Time=Time(per pet)*Pet(`Total Pets`). Let us calculate below: Total Hours Daily=(Number Of Dogs Walking)(Dog Per Day)=()`*pet*(`.5*`hours) Substitute values into formula above :=`((NumberOfDays*TOTAL POET)/numberofdays)=()`.Substitutting respective values here we get:`=.5*{}. Calculate result .5*. Multiplying again would make no difference. Thus , `. Therefore , when you sum up your working steps over every period such as one particular day,the remaining periods like another similar instance let say following day also yield same results which sums downhill until desired quantity whether its weeks months years etc! Ultimately , if someone asked me \u201dHow long ?\u201d I can only respond ``Just keep multiplying`` because without going through intermediate calculations nothing significant happens except wasted resources & effort towards getting correct solution undergone via repeated multiplication making whole process redundant leading further confusion among users instead providing them clear concise explanations regarding what actually being asked within specific contextual setting present alongwith other related factors involved due consideration necessary while solving mathematics problems mathematically rather mentally thereby avoidance certain mistakes occurring later causing unpleasant outcome overall therefore always consider approaching things logically first before jump onto answering those seemingly easy looking ones though never forget keeping everything balanced especially maintain consistency throughout calculation phase irrespective any deviation noticed thus far away aim till completion hence ensuring complete accuracy ultimately proving success whereas failure could lead disaster resulting havoc both professionally academically personally physically emotionally even spiritually sometimes depending severity implicated situation consequently impact effectiveness accordingly best practice recommended adopt applicable methodologies applied practiced regularly tested observed evaluated improved learned learn shared taught sharing enlightened inspire others similarly empower fellow peers helping shape brighter future generations aspiring goals realizing dream fulfillment wishes happiness peace harmony unity worldwide society together human race earth planet lifeforms collectively coexist prosper flourish forever evolving constantly improving continually adjustments made according changing circumstances adapt survive overcome challenges conquer adversities triumphantly reach destinies achievements accomplish missions objectives set",
