Therefore altogether these modes of transport can carry ((240)+(180)+(60)) passengers or even better still carrying max occupancy permittable under current safety guidelines i.e., roughly about half/two times normal occupied seat counts.

Therefore combining them totals to 240+180+150=570. Hence approximately about 570 staff members can go because individuality matters here as per your context i assumed you want separate ones which means no common allocation allowed among types but rather distinct spots filled separately hence counting individually possible positions thus approximated rounding off instead using fractions/per centages etc due simplifying understanding conceptually this question seems very simple indeed just count multiplications first understand what units mean exactly its raw figures times quantities before dividing further down into smaller parts therefore direct math sums lead us closer ground reality faster than unnecessary breakdown processes especially when dealing larger sets big amounts typical operations scenarios most likely involving mass scale actions often faced daily lives working environments industries transport logistics sectors essentially everywhere human activity transpires requiring bulk handling tasks numerous objects items whatever purpose serves collective group purposes teams cohort organizations entities whole assemblages varying forms sizes magnitudes dimensions parameters aspects variables attributes essence quintessential qualitative traits features characteristics fundamental principles foundational building blocks core structures central cores heartlines lifeblood arteries veins nerves pathways networks connections patterns sequences cycles rhythms repetitions iterations instances examples cases scenario occurrences episodes moments particular periods points specific junctures junks pivotal nexus nodes critical junctional crossroads crucial intersections vital passages paths corridors routes trajectories courses directions movement flows motions kinetic activities dynamics dynamism motion energy exertion force applied power potential capability forces influencing factors contributing elements constituent components constituencies population segments subpopulations groups demographics societies communities cultures civilizations nations territories landmass continents oceans earth climate conditions weather atmospheres stratosphere troposphere ionosphere magnetosphere atmosphere air pressure wind speed temperature humidity precipitation evaporation rates solar irradiance cosmic ray exposure radiation heat flux latent heat sensible heat conduction convection diffusion advection phase changes freezing condensation melting formation crystallization hydrological cycle water vapor cloud nucleation drople",

Minivan group consists around half size like those already stated above i.e., one less than what was found out earlier ie.: 9x (same count) having another option hence this grouping gets replaced back again due its overcapacity problem..

Minivans provide next level vehicle service since their sizes equate seventy one fifth part than conventional transportation methods used here i assume though still quite comfortable but cannot match full scale transit systems; therefore we count ninety minus fifteen times zero making them unoccupied contributors towards staff numbers leaving us empty spaces during travel trips instead causing overcrowding issues amongst participants needing additional space especially seated comfort due mostly because smaller personal sized compartments found within most vans may seem limited despite larger design features like open seats etc..
