        " 5 * $1.50 = $7.50. Next calculate the cost of the pens. With 2 pens priced at $0.25 per unit, it would amount to 2 * $0.25 = $0.50. The price of the single calculator stands as $12. Furthermore, the geometric set totals up to $10 (which includes its matching ruler). Without any reductions yet applied, add those expenses together which amounts to ($7.50+$0.50+$12+$10) equals $30. To find out about the store\u2019s percentage off offer, multiply this summed value by ten percent or rather divide the same quantity by eleven (since you can consider 'one minus discount') therefore reducing your overall purchase by $3, bringing down the original bill from $30 to ($30-$3), resulting into being charged only $27 instead! Thus, when we deduct these savings due caregiver promotion strategies employed herein underway; resultantly presented becomes our grand finale outcome hence stating definitively finally \"$27\".
