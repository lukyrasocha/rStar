Determine what percentage of this volume of milk eventually spoiled; since we know that exactly 2 out of every 5 units account for damaged goods or items past their sellable lifespan\u2014this corresponds approximately to saying just under half (the reciprocal fraction here being (\\frac{5}{2})=2.5). That translates into roughly halving all products involved hence cutting costs down as well resulting only about \\$7,000 remaining when returning those unusable assets back via refund based upon original agreement terms.\\nSo, Mr.Marcelli received a refund worth around $$$7,000$. His loyalty towards retail business spanning twenty plus seasons contributed significantly thereby fostering customer trust through quality assurance standards thus enabling such leniency regarding faulty stock returns",
        ". Therefore, (4000 x $3.5) equals $14000 as initial sales revenue before any deductions or returns due to bad goods like spoiled food items or damaged merchandise. According to the problem scenario stated above, it indicates about rotten ones which amounts up being approximately (2/5)x4000 => ~1600 bottles worth $. To determine the exact refund value would require knowing the current market prices if these bottles can still hold their resale values because we don\u2019t know what proportion represents whole sealed products.

Since these gallons cannot be used or resold hence return them for reimbursement i.e., we multiply this volume back into dollar terms as follows; Refund Amount = Expired Volume * Cost Price Per Gallon => Refund Amount = 1600 * $3.5 =====>$5600 . Hence, Mr.Marcellu received $5600 in refunds due to the defective products discovered post purchase irrespective whether or no it would impact his loyalty towards their establishment since such unfortunate incidents can happen regardless despite one\u2019s relationship history with businesses.

Since the time period mentioned about him having run the business doesn't affect this calculation directly; it isn't used here but just states additional contextual information about Mr. Marcellus or the longevity of his establishment might suggest experience managing such situations effectively. Regardless of duration, all we need to consider here focuses solely around quantity and price factors leading up to receiving a monetary reimbursement due to unsellables goods.

Next calculate the quantity which was bad quality since it exceeded its timeframe. Divide the initial purchase volume(${4{,}000}$) times $(2/5)$ or multiply ${4{,}000 \\div 5}\\times2$. This calculates as ${(8{,}000}/5)$, so we find out about $$1{,}600$ worth offending bottles.
