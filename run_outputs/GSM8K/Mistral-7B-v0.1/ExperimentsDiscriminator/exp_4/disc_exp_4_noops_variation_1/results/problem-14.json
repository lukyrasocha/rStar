Since time equals distance over speed (and assuming constant distances), doubling the amount of creatures moving means you halve the individual creature's crossing times due to shared labor distribution among them \u2013 Time taken = Distance/(Time*speed); Doubling quantity doubles coverage but only halves traversal timeline when considering equal contribution factor (creatureCount variable scaling effect negated since distributivity applies uniformly & independently irrespective of crew size multiplier i.e., Quantity^unitSizeEffectiveContribution=Quantity which simplifies out).

Taking into account their jump power doesn't affect our calculation since no information about distance or individual speeds was provided. Now considering another scenario involves turtles who move slower than kangaroos; if every new animal species moves twice slowly when compared to kangaroos, this implies every single minute spent travelling would instead translate as taking double the original amount within respective conditions. This doubling effect cancels out because 'doubled slowness' becomes equivalent back to normal relative movement \u2013 thus regardless of whether you\u2019re using either animals type here ('kangaroos', 'turtles'), your units stay constant over time periods mentioned.

We assume both groups cover equal distances thus comparing these equations:   Kangaroo Speed Ratio Turtle Slow    Times Travelling       Cross Country     ===============        __     ______________________________      Time             Road Across Highway                Group          Rate              Given information says , group B\u2019s rates differed thrice vs those possessed by group C thereby meaning ratio was calculated into \u2018group B->ratio 3 & groupC ->ratio 1'. From earlier equation setup above therefore calculating values for respective variables like ;GroupB-->timeXrate X ratio equals area coverage\u2026..and consequently doing similar computations for other entities leads us onto following numerical results expressed via tabular representation below:-            Column Headings                 Area Coverage        \tSpeed Value\tRatio Number               Comparative Groups           RoadAcrossHillway            CompareWithTurtleSpeeds...so.........distance travered ...their speeds ....but also relative timing........divide areas by comparable numbers within our data set...likewise dividing overall units up accordingly when dealing with various combinations etc.--->--a bit simplified but still helps maintain basic math principles among most readers without requiring knowledge about physics related theories such electricity+magnetic fields together!
