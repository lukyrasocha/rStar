We find approximately six plus seven % above baseline while still under threshold means having around twice eighty percentage levels together which yields fifteen point increments awayfrom zero being quite unattainable unless working toward passing grades via repetition without worrying too closely whether others might fare better based upon similar efforts made similarly early during school years through study habits learned thus far overseen largely due parental support etc.).
