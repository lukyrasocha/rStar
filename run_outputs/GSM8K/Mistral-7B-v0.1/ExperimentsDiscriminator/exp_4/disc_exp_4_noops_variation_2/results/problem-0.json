As such while taking account time spent when not moving towards physical exertion due to actions unrelated directly onto exercise activity (here tied downing shoes or stretching as might also occur post activities); no additional meter value needs consideration here since its irrelevant regarding overall measure distances covered through effort exercised henceforth answered remains constant i.e., __540__.

Hence, it isn\u2019t relevant here so regardless, even considering if time matters such as when shoeing tied momentarily; our calculation stays constant because no extra distances involved due to delay caused during exercise routine repetition i.e., speed remains same but only pause taken breaks interval happened temporarily not resulting additional mileage overall .

Final calculation disregards timing taken while securing shoe laces because we focus only upon covered distance within fixed intervals.
