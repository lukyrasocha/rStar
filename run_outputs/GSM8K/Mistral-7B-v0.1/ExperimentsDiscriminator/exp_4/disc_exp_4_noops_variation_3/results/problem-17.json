Therefore, even assuming no external factors impact his journey length such as rest times or unforeseen circumstances affecting fuel consumption which could slow him down slightly due to increased engine load, based solely off averages presented within the question context, one might conclude that theoretically speaking under ideal circumstance, Michael will need approximately around 120 hours covering about halfway across America barring fatigue related delays thus suggesting roughly ~25% completion when measured against said 'distant goal'.

Considering mileage expended during breaks adds another small fractional value (.5) therefore multiplying them together ((speed*time)-distance), getting roughly about four percent completion[((number_ofdays=Day)*dailyusage+(break)=total)] To reach any arbitrary destinations within these regions requires multiple trips back and forth across vast distances hence why roundtrip commuting isn\u2019t recommended due its impact upon fuel economics but rather driving directly toward such points offers better efficiency when selecting optimal paths & avoidances zones.[Also note calculations here don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t factor additional factors associated wth traffic flow variations resulting solely out from weather conditions nor road quality discrepancies caused via geological formations leading upwards towards said destination.] Therefore despite utilizing appropriate methods thus far providing correct estimates while attempting understanding complexities involved surrounding route planning consider implementing measures mitigating further confusion possibly involving exploratory surveying techniques coupled alongside mathematical analysis applying various equations allowing precise determination relevant scenarios thereby ensuring maximum accuracy achieved throughout entire process regardless whether examining transit times spent covering relatively shorter versus longer routes traversals alike considering specific preferences related individual drivers habits alongwith vehicle performance characteristics potentially affecting their respective choices made accordingly regarding potential expedients undertaken depending entirely wholly dependentupon unique circumstances encountered both beforehand ahead preparing itself well informed decisionmaking crucial component sustaining success achievement objectives intended fulfilled goals pursued endeavor dedicated aim accomplished ultimately reaching desired outcome successfully",
