Finally divide that amount by .1 to apply sales taxes using the formula S=(P/T)-D P being your original purchase cost T representing percent off D indicating no decimal points present because its hundredth place zero serves us well here therefore applying them yields ((17/.1)\u00d7(.9))=<<((17/.1)*(.9))=153.0>>-$153 rounded up since purchases typically don\u2019t accept fractions of pennies resulting in approximately $<<153=.153>>a bill ranging somewhere above fifteen twenty four thousand seven eighty sixteen ninety dollar signs just past halfway across town near City College campus",
        " this amounts to (5*1.5) + (2*0.25) + 12 + 10=7.5 + 0.5+12+10 which equals $30 spent before any discount. Applying the shop\u2019s 10% off promotion brings down prices as follows: Notebook cost becomes 5*(1.5*$0.9), Pen cost turns into ($0.25*$0.9)+($0.25)*(as we know Geometry sets only require us to consider Ballpoint Pens), Calculator costs $(12*.9)=$10.8$, while the Geography Set remains unchanged. This totals up to $13+$((0.9)(5))+(1/2)^$(0.9)$+10=$13+$4.50+$0.23+= $\\\\sim\\\\rightarrow$17.72$. Thus, Daniel needs around \\boxed{17.72}.

        " * .25 + 12 + 10 = $31.25 without the coupon/discount amount.. With a 10% off (or multiplying it by .9), we get (.9)($31.25) or just $.27 per dollar spent initially! To calculate this problem out fully requires using actual costs rather than approximations because rounding down means less cost savings overall. But if you want to approximate quickly here\u2019s what I would go through roughly following these steps; multiply everything together like before except also consider taxes since most states impose them which varies depending upon location., finally add any applicable sales tax rates as well.(Tax Rate Example:$1*(.05)+$0+$(12*.15)+$,(Geometry Set TaxExample):=$.2/$=$)$((Coupon Savings)= ($)(Discount Amount)=(-.$0). Therefore,,,(After applying Discount Cost)= $-(Total initial Price)- (Amount saved).. Thus,-(Dollars Spent Total Initially\u2013Coupon SAVED=-($31.25\u2212[.*$$)). This equation tells us exactly how much needs paid once calculated correctly but its best practice first doing exact calculations THEN calculating estimates so mistakes aren\u2019t made later.).
