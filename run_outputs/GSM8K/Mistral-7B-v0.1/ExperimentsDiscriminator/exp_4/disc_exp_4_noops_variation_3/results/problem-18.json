Given no numerical values or numbers related directly tied specifically towards any particular subject such English/Math etc..

        ". However, it doesn't specify whether this requirement applies separately per individual exam or cumulatively over all exams together. Generally speaking (unless otherwise stated), we assume such overall passing percentages apply unless explicitly specified differently within instruction context; therefore let's use an approach based upon assuming these criteria as mentioned broadly herein applicable across multiple exams rather than strictly singular to any one specific evaluation individually undertaken. Consequently under our chosen course assumption calculation would proceed thus: Total Queries= ",
        "%, which equals 0.7 (as percentages represent parts per hundred). To determine the number of questions worth answering over all, find their sum since audrey takes one exam twice; add together both exams\u2019 numbers.

Remember however our goal was still trying to figure out what fraction or percentage represents passing scores because as you already know audreye needed 70 % To find out just what portion missing these problems makeup add percentages together but notice due to simplifications above; Since  36+ ~~(removed previous calculation~~)+70%= 106%, making her new base value equal parts overshooting expectations .
