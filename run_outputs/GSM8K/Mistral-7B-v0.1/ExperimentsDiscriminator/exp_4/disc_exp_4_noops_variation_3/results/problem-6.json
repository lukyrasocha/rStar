Next up, compute what the overall value of Pants($P$) might look like using '$W$'. You see, the task instructively says \u2018the trousers need to equal the mean values,\u2019 meaning you can take (${H}$+${T}$)/2=. Using your previously identified variable sets within placeholders denoted respectively {{$H$} , {$T$}}, substitute into expression ${W={({H}+{T}){\\Big /}2}}$ so : W=${{(25)+(75)}\\\\over {2}}$ Therefore ${W=\\frac{{100}}{2}}$, hence **w**ressors (**pants** -- written differently but still referring exactly to Trouser clothes mentioned initially)*cost*, amount ushered down per unit of clothing item being discussed equals $\\boxed{{\\text{Jackets}}}$, equating thusly to about **$\\stackrel{-}{9}\\heartsuit$** dollars*.

That means every member needs also to buy pants whose prices equal half the sum of both jacket and the hat which makes them equal to ($25*$75)/(2)=((5^2)*($5))/2=($5)^3$. Adding all up $(25+75+(5)^3)$ gives us $\\boxed{125}$ hence everyone pays $125 per unit if nothing else was included within this order yet.
