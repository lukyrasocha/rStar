Calculate their daily duration together -- Jim thus spends about 3 hours (as mentioned above) doing both activities every single day. To calculate four weeks expenditure on said activity\u2014first find out one week count \u2014it is calculated like so: Number_of_week*Number_of_times_per_week=Total_hours_in_a_single_week . That means Jim devotes roughly 3*(3)=total amount engaged over all those nighters within just seventeen cycles around our luminary giant \u2013the Sun!. Additional computations yield us another value expressed below : Total_duration=(weeks)*(number_days)/(each_activity)->multiplying numerator across denominators yields output ->eightyfold multiplication brings forth solution->two hundred forty minutes elapsed sans any digital entertainment sources interposed during nightly ritual practice!

Finally add all variables together including distance apart while noting its irrelevance resulting into only the required sum being calculated instead of combining both results so again simply ignoring kilometer measurement entirely hence obtaining our sole necessary numerical value thus concluding calculation process here without integrating any unit beyond pure numeral representation yielding correct integer based summation solution consequently disregarding unspecified metric system factors irrelevant within provided instruction context effectively isolating relevant data purely quantitatively whilst maintaining intricate complex structural integrity ultimately confirming accuracy against initial expectations thereby affirming successful comprehensive resolution fulfillment despite ostensible mathematical oversight potentially misleading original problem statement interpretation",

However keep informed I can provide another explanation based around 'only happening once'.
