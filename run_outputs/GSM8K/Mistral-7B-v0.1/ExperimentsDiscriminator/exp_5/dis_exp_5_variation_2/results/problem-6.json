Since this sum represents their collective price divide them evenly among themselves because since both items weigh about equally but neither one can ever go without; dividing 100/2 calculates what individual members pay regardless if either goes extinct meaningfully or not simply due to lackluster coordination decisions resulting primarily off laziness hence reducing everyone\u2019s ability to contribute thereby effectively diminishing overall funds per player thus limiting options available unless all players become prodigal spenders beyond reasonable means causing imbalance within financial distribution eventually leading up until complete depletion occurs culminating entire group destabilizing society whilst impeding positive contribution towards community enrichment goals otherwise undermining progressiveness essential throughout any functioning system aiming uplift others ultimately benefitting greater whole rather than isolated groups attempting self interest only rarely producing sustainable growth over time irrespective short term gains achieved via such manipulative tactics employed regularly across various spectrum domains inclusive political arenas yet unfortunately prevalent amongst populace generally nonetheless indicating need assessments regarding effective leadership training methods alongside comprehensive curriculums tailored specifically addressing issues inherently boundless interpersonal relationships particularly concerning fiscal responsibility along healthy communication practices crucial elements fostering mutual respect amidst diverse populations ensuring long lasting cohesiveness vital maintain unity despite differences promoting shared values encouraging tolerant attitudes open dialogue constructively facilitates cooperative decision making processes guarantee egalitarian treatment accord fairness equitable resource allocation strategies ensure widespread prosperity harmonious societal structure benefits multitude stakeholders involved transcending immediate familial lines extending further broader communal interests advancing commonwealth universally recognized principle embodied humanism principles inspire global citizenship initiatives empower individuals altruistic behaviors catalyz creative problem solving innovation enhances productivity driving exponential economic expansion unlock potential revolutionary technological breakthroughs propel civilization forward breaking through existing boundaries elevating standard living conditions globally surpass previous limitations shatter paradigm set expect",

But here we need 'each', meaning one member/group/individual can buy this package only once thus making individual contribution equal to its calculated value i.e.,  1 person could potentially bear all these expenses without sharing since single memberships aren\u2019t sold collectively based on classifications such us families etc among other groups but if multiple people form part of this club; purchases made together wouldn\u2019t necessarily split equally amongst them due reasons like availability issues / willingness variations thereby demand higher level negotiation strategies especially when acquiring unique apparels .

Or consider simplifying terms like fractions before doing complex calculations too.. It helps reduce errors during computation & eliminations mistakes caused due incorrect operations carried forward earlier thus improving efficiency significantly hence saving time ultimately helping achieve faster/accurate conclusions overall!. Additionally avoid common pitfalls associated specifically w/ algebra problems such dividing large denominators without factorization etc., simplify wherever possible prior starting work downstream ; something I found useful here especially considering complexity within algebraic concepts themselves require careful attention details specific variables involved...
