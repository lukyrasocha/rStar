Thus James ends up running a total distance of about  540 km/week along these calculations; therefore it appears we may need additional contextual information regarding what part of 'total' refers if considering scale relative or another unit conversion as our current calculation only provides the direct quantity within stated parameters. Nonetheless! To directly compare distances against one such as river lengths\u2014like herein mentioned being roughly twice short of Earth\u2019s moon trip via Apollo missions \u2014is inherently challenging without further specifying whether converting into miles, scaling down proportionally etc., which unfortunately falls beyond question scope posited thus far.(Considerations include conversely using metric mile approximations).
