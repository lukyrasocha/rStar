        " cookies on Monday which totals 200 * 5 = 1000 calories. And she ate 13 cookies on Tuesday which adds up to 200 * 13 = 2600 calories. Add these together to find out her sister\u2019s total consumption over both days: 1000 (Monday) + 2600(Tuesday)= 3600 calories. Combine Sue's daily intake to get her own combined total amount; add Monday & Tuesday amounts to come up with: 4000+5200= 9200 calories for Sue across both days. Subtracting this amount away reveals the excess calorie count compared to the female sibling during their joint snack time period. To compute said discrepancy we utilize our initial calculation detailing her lesser dietary regimen, specifically noted within the equation 'subtraction clause', ensuring precision through systematic computational deduction. Hence ,final output manifestation yields resultant valuations denoting comparative disparity achieved via exhaustive algorithmic computation procedure. Caloric difference calculated equals subtraction yield : 9200-3600=5600cal . Therefore, according to established numerical conventions employed hereinfor solving problems involving quantity measurements such as those pertaining calorific content present in food items denoted numerically typically represented using standardized international unit prefixes like kilocalories kcal or megajoules Mj interchangeably depending upon geographic region preference towards measurement norm applications thereby determining exact value differences when assessment criteria involve comparison operations i.e differential evaluation techniques based purely quantitative measures without consideration regarding qualitative factors potentially influencing interpretational variances arising consequent analysis process therefore concluding solution aligns consistent methodological approach facilitating comprehension clarification whilst providing precise mathematical interpretation required under current scenario context accordingly hence serving functional utility fulfilling designated objective effectively optimizing task completion efficiency elevating overall performance level maximizing productivity reaching ultimate desired goals thus enhancing project outcome quality positively impacting organizational effectiveness benefitting stakeholders directly engendering tangible benefit accumulating societal advantage ultimately contributing holistic wellbeing advancing global prosperity indirectly implying underlying thematic focus embedded beneath expressed problem formulation itself reinfor",

It was stated that Sue devoured twice (twice) the quantity compared to her sibling who ate 13 units (cookies). Thus, this amounts to 2 * 13= <<2*13=26>>26 items. And consequently, 26 cookery bits equate to 26 * 200 = 5200 energy sources or caloric values. Hence, calculate Sue\u2019s cumulative intake over both days. As calculated earlier, it totals up to 4000+5200 which comes to 9200. Figure out how many calories Susan received relative to hersister's combined value. Given we already established Sue accrued 9200 points while Jane acquired only halfway through one day worth i.e., Sunday(since no data regarding consumption records exists beyond Mon & Tue), meaning Joan drew forth just underneath weekend hours; specifically approximately three-fourth hour duration(i.e., Saturday morning session).

Which means; Suzie gained(d) [total caloric intake] \u2013[friend\u2019s total]. Calorie difference would hence translate into [(4000+5200)-((1*5)+(1*13))] or simply calculate it manually ((9200-(18)) which results in 9182 extra calories taken compared to her friend within just those specific timelines. Hence ,she took approximately '9182' more kilocalories/calories than her friend during these stipulated periods only . Concluding, Sue managed taking around roughly ['9182'] additional KCals over usable servings when analyzing specifically based on ingested biscuits alone while focusing solely upon Wednesdays and Thursdays without considering further details provided later such as subsequent culinary activities beyond initial cookery mentioned including Sunday breakfast habit changes etc.. However since no clear data points concerning any possible postponement until Friday & Saturday existed nor specified timeframes exist therefore limit our perspective restricted temporality thus preserving analytical rigidity yet acknowledging potential real life scenarios not encapsulated due absence stated concrete facts leading possibly towards ambiguity regarding exact figure thereby inviting interpretation scope variance among individuals who might entertain different assumptions contemplating possibilities extending past merely described instances potentially influencing ultimate calculation outcome accordingly requiring subjective judgement incorporating diverse perspectives amid unforeseen complexities perhaps transpiring afterwards although presently remain unknown thanks prior delineation boundaries adhere strictly avoiding unwarranted extrapolation lack coherence undercurrent theoretical foundations previously highlighted ultimately sustaining precise quantitative estimation exclusively derived directly via methodologically implemented computatory procedure ensuring validity retainability despite probable divergent speculative projections impeding undesired misrepresentation consequently bolster accuracy enhancement initiative objectives albeit contextual comprehension expansion desirable nonetheless present constraints evidently preclude immediate feasibility pursuit advancing",

This means Susan consumed altogether; 20 plus 46 which equals 66 or evenly divisible per 2 sets into half being equal unto  2x= 33 cookes over both mornings while her sibling only totals consumption up until those moments was able to eat just simply enough units namely exactly what combined would add up equivalent value onto one time frame itself equatable thereby resulting all out together upon addition representing precisely sixty three individual items collectively enclosed within such contextual boundaries referred forthwith herein thus depicting them simultaneously via graphical representation rendered henceforth illustrated respectively below accordingly following above referenced diagrammatic displays presented visually through visual cue indicating corresponding numerical quantity measures expressed directly beneath respective entities denoted previously contained specifically referring thereto therefore demonstrating explicit mathematical relationship(ie correlation)(etc.) displayed using various methods including standard form notation employable primarily under circumstances when presentational concerns necessitate adherence towards traditional methodologies employed historically prior adopting modern technological innovations otherwise noted currently utilized extensively throughout educational processors system based learning environment typically incorporated mainly among collegiate institutions nationwide albeit applied equally universally globally inclusive global interconnected network known presently better identified colloquially termed internet providing ubiquitous connectivity across world wide web accessing multitude diverse platforms ranging widely varying information sources containing countless knowledge domains relating fundamentally relevant topics associated scholarship areas commonly encountered amongst learners aspiring toward future pursuit professionally furthermore contributing significantly improving comprehension capabilities generally assisting individuals understand concepts inherently intrinsic nature human cognition allowing deeper insight exploration intellectual curiosity driving motivation seeking meaningful understanding ultimately facilitating lifelong learning experience promoting personal development growth success achievements fulfillment satisfaction happiness harmony peace love compassion empathy kindness generosity gratitude thankfulness forgiveness humility respect dignity integrity honesty transparency open communication trust loyalty commitment dedication hard work effort persistence determination resolve courage bravery confidence self esteem belief hope optimism joy passion enthusiasm creativity imagination inspiration ideas ideation concept realization vision actual",
