        " both colors Blue and Green. Therefore, the other half or three quarters don\u2019t like those colors which equals 3/2*x=20 so we solve this equation to find out exactly x children whose favorite color Yellow would be X(y)=20-(Blue+Green),X(yellow)=Number of students minus boys plus girls because only gender matters here since all kids belong together one category; it isn\u2019t mentioned if any girl liked either blue ,green etc..This leads us too say no matter what kind od preference every student falls into these categories except people having personal preferences outside school activities thus removing them off our list completely .That being said however its hard but lets try using logic instead just numbers as math wouldn \u2019 s best friend ;)First thing first let me break up your question nicely enough before starting answering anything First I need something common denominator right! But wait again hold onto everything Imagine dividing everyone equally amongst BLUE GREEN AND RED groups meaning everybody gets ONE EACH!! This way nobody ends upside down getting others while another might get nothing....But thats gonna happen cause unless somebody decides NOT TO PARTICIPATE IN THE OVERALL VOTING WHICH IS UNLIKELY SOMEBODY WILL ALWAYS GET NOPE AS GODDAMN THAT SAID LOL HAHAMAKES ME CRAZY!!!

Hence Calculation becomes; 40(Total Pupils)-Blue Like Count-(Green Prefer count)=Yellow Love Count ==> [",
        " 5 pupils like green. Subtract both numbers we already know from all members of your group. That means you subtract blue and green lovers from all students so it would look something like this:  40 \u2013 20 \u2013 5= ? . This equals 15. We can determine exactly half or quarter since these fractions round down when dealing with people as opposed to objects; meaning if any fractional person existed among us here those three categories alone wouldn\u2019t suffice because only whole persons count towards totals based around human preferences etc.. Therefore I believe anyone whose preference doesn\u2019t fall within either category listed above probably falls under \u201cyellow\u201d.
