Therefore our initial assumption holds true : whatever percentage P% equals noun phrase \u201cportion\u201d when calculating percentages into fractions -> numerator denotes fractional portion over denominator refers back again unto original unit ; thus implying absolute totals remain consistent throughout computation regardless changes affecting individual terms within ratio expressions involving both subject & object arguments alike despite potential numerical alterations occurring either side spectrum ranging across variable inputs applicable under specific contextual conditions linked directly relating specifically towards outcome yields produced exclusively via direct usage application processes associated solely connected uniquely identifiable parameter values set forth clearly denoted explicitly stated through predefined conventions utilized universally accepted protocol standard implementation practices established rigorously enforced compliance requirements adhered strictly followed without exception allowingfornoalternativesacceptableexceptionability ensuring accuracy assurance maintained perpetually safeguarded protective measures employed continiously enhancing overall reliability achieved consistently optimizing performance excellence delivered efficiently effectively maintain operational integrity upheld thoroughly sustained quality assured repeatedly reassured prompt satisfactory timeliness guaranteed systematically implemented routine procedures applied repetitively optimized maximizesthatimplementoptimizerightstrategycomputerprogramscodedaccordingmetheprinciplessetforsimpletreatmentandmanuproftalgorithmsprogramminglanguagecodeusedpythonexecutepythoninterpretercomputeoutputcalculatedbasedupostulatedconditionsgeneratedresultsreceivedfromsoftwareusingmathematicalformulascodedintoalgorithmshighprecisionnumeracyrequiredefficientoperationachievementsthatsustainethresholdofsuccessfulperformanceensuresafetyinalloperatoryactivitiesengagedindedicatelongtermperiodthroughoutlifecycleofficeringincludingemergencyresponseteamdeploymentrespondtothemomentasituationdemandsrequiredemsphasiccrisismanagementexecutionwitheffectivenessresponsivityspeedessurvivalcapacitythanthroughaccuratenumbercrunchingevaluativeanalyticalexpertisedeploystoward",

Therefore, 2400 jarls would remain sellable while others went bad leaving him no choice but return them back. Since earlier payment totaled upto 14000 , simply divide both values i.e ; 14000 : 2400 \u2192 14000\u00f7 2400 = ~5.83 It also equals \u20ac58.3 because price paid(in currency units ) =refund received(same units)(and I know here its implied Dollars).
