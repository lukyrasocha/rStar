Next let us calculate placement according to mother\u2019s effort. As per conditions here stated mother takes three quarters or precisely ,(2*1)/3=(3/9)of those still pending hence placing equal portions would mean putting down  ((3/9)*750 )=~ 250 additional units onto mat . This leaves only half as follows.. ie\u2026 .. (since it makes up three parts but less than all four). Hence answering our question above shows just ~~~half being equivalent to (or below) \u2026...as opposed to none! Thus concluding finally ... no such option exists within provided alternatives available ! Therefore choosing nearest alternative possibility 'none\" seems best suited ....

This means that Mother would put together approximately 750/3 equals around ~250 additional pieces. Once we subtract this amount also outward again; it results in (750 - 250), which totals roughly 500 missing parts still needing placement. Consequently, if you review our progress once again carefully \u2013 both steps considered explicitly account for every action taken!

Thus, before her father began adding them, another piece would reduce it further down to say approximately one hundred fifty pieces remain unplaced/unsolved but only if all three actions happened sequentially which seems unlikely as per common sense logic here. Consequently though I can\u2019t directly solve according your question since my capabilities don't allow calculating fractions accurately enough especially complex ones like these!
