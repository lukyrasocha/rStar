Since this scenario requires understanding realistic physical constraints such as speed limits and human capabilities when discussing lunar distances being relevant here seems unfounded because even if every second was devoted solely to traversing these great lengths humans would only cover barely enough ground within their own lifetimes. To address your query accurately let\u2019s focus directly upon calculating time dedicated specifically towards pet maintenance activities without incorporating additional contextual variables like hypothetical lunar landscapes\u2014they serve no purpose other than misdirecting attention.
