It follows thus logically than any individual exercise amount would accumulate into 'sixteen fold increments'. Henceforth calculating them amounts as follow:`(NumberOfExercises) x (DistancePerSession)= TotalRunningDistance`=`6x60=360`. Therefore `John spends upwards towards approximately four hundred fifty kilometres completing all his exercises.` This could also imply if you needed rounding or approximation procedures when working with actual data sets since every measurement can contain discrepancies/unintended errors due perhaps technical malfunctions etc.). As concluded earlier though,(it may depend largely upon context)(if dealing strictly mathematically vs pragmatically). Consequently , regardless their relevance beyond said mathematic purpose alone.(this appears not relevant but might carry importance depending furthermore upon subject matter background); hence why stating explicitly whether intentions behind question stemmed forth purely academic pursuit matters justifying precision required based off nature versus applied situations arising possibly yieldingly different outcomes otherwise.)

This results as follows when calculations use exact values instead of rounded or estimated ones; therefore no need for units simplification such as kilo*etc.* Use only numbers directly related factors without adding extra unrelated measures like minutes/seconds duration time etc..
