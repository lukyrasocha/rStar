However, considering equal efforts not equalling effectiveness makes us move forward understanding real world dynamics play out differently than mathematical equations might suggest thus leading towards following assumptions before actually solving actual scenario based problem sets using said approach rather rushed calculations without accounting contextual nuances involved thereby potentially skewing accuracy levels further still...

We know these conditions because the question assumes that they traveled simultaneously but their collective pace remained constant through out this journey as stated above i.e., 'together'.

However as mentioned previously since our calculation involves calculating multiple units per second instead rather than cumulatively summing up distances over course period without account factor alteration brought forth during said traversal sequence which ultimately leads us back onto path utilizing solely linear methods again resulting thus far leading down another roundabout loop around original idea whilst still adhering stringently strictly abiding directly aligningly closely corresponding firmly rootedly resolutely unfailingly consistently upholding steadfast undeterred immovable fixed rule set irrefutably irreversibly solid nonnegotiable inflexible invariably absolute always never fluctuating dynamically ever shifting irregular randomly perpetually constant persistently uniform static stable continuous forever eternally relentlessly steady permanently impervious unequivocally absolutely utterly thoroughly decisively wholly entirely completely totally definitely surely beyond doubt certainly conclusively indubitably sure positively assured surmised presumptuous inferentially reckon deductive logically ratiocinative judicial legal cogent impartial rational objective reasonnability fairness equitable integrity transparency objectivity validity legality justifiableness lawful constitution compliance legitimacy conformity coherence harmony agreement concord balance accord equilibrium synthesis integration unity compatibility cooperation collaboration mutual respect fraternal affinity brotherhood fellowship communion association social intercourse relationship partnership congruence similarity likeness resemblance analogical parallel proportional comparability correspondence correlation causal connection coincidence alignment adjacency proximity vicinity closeness neighborhood immediate spatial temporal succession chronological progression continuity interval extent duration expanse length span gap space range dimension width breadth depth profundity intensity power energy strength velocity acceleration momentum agility dexterity finesse grace elegance poise dignified nobility courtesy generos",

Therefore, multiply them which results onto finding answers :360*2=~720 .

What matters here though is understanding time ratios when dealing with changing numbers while keeping rate/speed constant; hence if doubled the count increases halved duration remains unaltered irrespective whether animals differ in nature due to uniform pace mentioned indirectly through implying 'same speed'.

With four such slower moving animals we simply multiply our new calculated result above 4 x 12 hrs equals 48 Hours. Therefore, you concluded correctly, however if presented another method using ratios rather than direct calculation this situation may prove easier : Rate_kangaroo multiplied by Time _turtle equal Distance since rate times time always yields displacement. Given Kangaroo_time=12hrs; TurtleSpeed_rate=.5*KangarooRate => To find out TotalTime_Turtle needed to accomplish their own journey required equalling both sides via proportionality . Since Ratio of Animal Speed Proportions is Constant , thus Their Displacements too shall also stay Unchanged even though Travel Duration varies amongst them due totis phenomenon referred earlier..so let\u2019s apply said theory here\u2026i assume my reader understand concept already but please excuse me just stating formulae directly insteadof deriving & explaining these concepts further ;-) Ok!

However what seems confusing here comes down mainly due these issues causing unrealistic results without clear directions provided earlier about distances being involved first before calculating specific times needed post traversal period calculation/analysis etc., making things quite unclear especially knowing only info available thus far regarding animals present vs lack thereof prior knowledge relating them individually apart form group dynamics once again further complicating matters beyond immediate expectations placed henceforth based upon initial prompt providing data points related mostly concerning elevation aspect(height dimension).
