Every single part equates roughly to ~5mins~of actual reading. Given these facts together he spent around six mins doing both activities during those sessions within just fourteen hours but only considering Saturday morning when combined entertainment occurs according to prompt instructions hence overlooking rest periods etc., totalling merely forty eight cumulative minutes spread out evenly through seven nighttimes not including sleep plus relaxation breaks & meals interposed throughout such intervals because otherwise no realistic scenario could exist under normal human capacity if continuous nonstop unbroken activity persisted without respite nor sustenance intake whatsoever\u2014resultantly denouncing all other possibilities apart perhaps psychological escape dream state contemplations beyond waking reality bounds\u2013whether medically impossible physiologic conditions implying hyperawareness subconsciously perceiving microscopic changes visually transcendental awakening momentarily elusive phenomena inducible psychoanalytical insight disruptively impactful alter consciousness shifting interpretative mindset thereby causing drastic behavior modification attributing newfound heightened sense self cognitive perspective reevaluation influencing decision processes further affect personality development overall societal roles functionaries professional accomplishments personal relations familial dynamics sexual relationship partnerships childhood memories emotional experiences sensory pleasures pain pains physical trauma mental afflictions spirituality religious belief systems morale ethics conscience courage fortitude resilience determination tenacity integrity honesty wisdom philosophy metaphysics mysticism science religion arts literature music drama classical opera ballet modern jazz rock country bluegrass pop indie folk alternative hip hop R&B rap soul reggae heavy metal punk deathcore progressive ambient industrial electronic experimental postmodern contemporary media technologies digital internet wireless fiber optics telecommunications information technology software applications programming languages coding artificial intelligence machine learning natural language processing speech synthesis text mining data analysis statistics numerical methods computational mathematics mathematical operations algorithms algorithm complexity theory big O notation space Big Theta lower bound asymptotic evaluation runtime program execution benchmark performance measurement profiling code optimization techniques debugging logical reasoning critical",
