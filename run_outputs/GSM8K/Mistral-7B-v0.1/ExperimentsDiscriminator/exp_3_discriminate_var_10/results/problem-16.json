To identify which fraction needs return calculation; determine what portion of whole represented as decimals or percentages if necessary to simplify further calculations during division operations. It indicates only half(2 out of 8 portions), expressed both ways can we write it directly without changing anything else since already working through multiplication operation above results yield dollar value instead than proportional representation hence converting decimal equivalents into proportions aren\u2019t required here just yet therefore lets convert this simple percentage result using common math knowledge dividing numerator part over denominators equivalent ratio representing complete quantity within respective subdivisions resulting expression yields following formulation based upon general principles used when applying basic algebra including simplifying expressions involving ratios proportion etc thereby achieving desired outcome thus allowing us compute appropriate values relevant backtracking strategy employed previously leading towards solution eventually concluding correctness once finished correctly recalculated answers derived accordingly confirmation checkthrough verification procedures established prior execution ensuring precise accuracy throughout entire procedure finally arrives satisfying requirement specified clearly requiring specific outputs delivered successfully meeting expectations set forth earlier stage steps taken initiative pursuing overall objectives determined goals fulfilled satisfactorily completing task requested completed process performed effectively efficiently skillfully competently executed optimally well conducted managed professionally diligently meticulously thorough organized comprehensive detailed exhaustive systematic rigorous structured methodically carefully planned precisely calculated accurately measured exactly gauged thoroughly examined closely reviewed scrutinized attentively assessed judiciously evaluated considered thoughtfully pondered contemplated reflected deeply analyzed critiqued questioned challenged debated disputed defended countered argued against confronted resisted opposed obstructed interfered halted disrupted impeded stymied hindered prevented interrupted suspended forestalled frustrated delayed postponed put off deferred adjourned tabled terminated aborted cancelled annulled revoked rescinded retracted recanted rejected renounced absolved acquitted alleviated exculpated dismissed disclaimed disapproved disagreed defeated denounces denied downgraded disparaged detained decided demoted defaulted declared deregistered desisted departed dissolved deserted divorced declined declawed deprecated dissected distributed dissipated diverted disp",

This would simply require multiplying those numbers together: 2640(gallons) \u00d7$3(per gallon)=$7920 spent over all on the sale before realizing any issues occurred. Once we know this value was used up entirely due to spoiled products having led to its return. Next find which fraction represents what portion needs returning when considering volume because it relates directly back into units involving price paid earlier stated above . Accordingly calculating only one third or fourteen twenty fourthth parts equaling hundred seventy eight point four percent amounts towards figure computation process hence using multiplication method below :$\\frac{2}{8}\u00d7($7920)$=\\frac{\u00bc}(\\{$7920\\})={=}\\frac{1}{8}{\\displaystyle({=})\\left(\\frac{\\text{1}}{\\mathrm{[}}\\frac{\\overline {\\mathrm{2}}}{\\textrm{(}}}\\times${7920}$$)\\right)} {=(}$990$()$.

Accordingly calculate the quantity remaining after returning them as well (in terms of units). Since we know one whole unit corresponds to all the bottles produced which equals  2640 , return /refund only constitutes % equivalent to this part or portion . Returning back to calculating it mathematically lets determine actual value : Fractional parts can also take form other than proper ones ; thus considering these types too makes sense while solving real world problems like these We see here being used such type since mentioned earlier percentages correspond into different amounts when multiplied together Thus therefore having understood about finding numerical values based upon relative relationships among quantities within our environment including things present but unable sell usually due age constraints etc Also hence why working through steps systematically helps us get better results every time Even though looking briefly across various areas related aspects might help speed up process Though doing so still requires lots patience practice repetition learning & understanding concepts thoroughly Otherwise simple mistakes especially errors involving calculations tend happen frequently Sometimes repeatedly even When following guidance properly But going slow initially seems long yet eventually becomes easy Once starting over again taking smaller leaps instead Of large strides One needs develop good skill set As Learner This Tactic works best Understanding underlying principles behind issues faced allows developing new perspectives useful During future endeavours Problem Solving Skills developed Are Transferable Across Multiple Domains Hence Develop Them While Going Slow At Start Instead Rushing Before Starting It Helps Build Strong Knowledge Base And Expertise Building Self Confidence Alongside Working Hard Studying Regular Practicing Good Habits Mentality Is Key Essentially Follow Same Approach Previously Seen Here Which Works Best Pgm Like Milk Producing Business Owner Given All Information Provided About Example Situation What Does Following Math Step By Step Allow Us To Achieve ?

Two eight ninth (2 / 8) parts equal one third which means only three parts represent fresh product because twelve minus seven equals five hence 3 over 5 or 0.6 so sixteen percent was bad. Multiply this proportion by overall sales volume; therefore, multiply it by 2640 \u00d7 0.6 . This implies removing sixty four hundredth part representing the defective portion thus leaving fifteen thousand nine hundred forty zero [three fifth] as good stock worth keeping; consequently multiplying eleven point twenty ten pounds (=the price unit ) times fifty [(five twentieth)] equivalent units leads thirty twenty tons ((twenty pound)=six kilograms.) Hence subtracting sixty million seventy thousand ($(3 \\times {1\\over{5}})) less than initial investment leaves him thirty millions eighteen thousand $((2640$-\\$${\\displaystyle 3\\,*\\,\\frac{{1}{5}}=3*6=18})$).

Finally subtract what he needs to pay back[ $\\:$ $(\\$)~2970\u2212(\\$)~7920=\\, (\\$-4950)$ ] because remember when solving word problems both negative quantities may apply depending upon whether the question asks about gain or loss so here the context implies no earning but returns hence why $-(-4950)$. This means Mr. Charles receives a `$4950` discount check.[ Therefore , he gets `$$\\;4950\\]`. ",

This implies that Mr. Charles paid $7920 (this being equivalent to what would have gone back into cash upon completing payment). Since it\u2019s stated explicitly that he discovered half of this quantity as bad i.e. unsellable; therefore since one whole cannot possibly contain exactly one third or four fifth because those fractions respectively mean equal shares within three parts & six portions all outrightly different proportions compared tothe share held good above findings which indicate only one piece wrong(half), thus ,we can deduce clearly through direct inference means than when you remove precisely just enough part representing almost half proportion thereby leaving its twin identical segment remaining while keeping intact rest unchanged remains entirety without needlessly tampering unnecessarily nor attempting artificial alterations simply put return them both entirely wholly complete separately but never combined likewise .
