With that figured out multiply(.2)$daily*days(). This results (.2)*($2)(45=total_income), resulting in %.8 over time spent using full income without waste! Our conclusion yields %8=$3.6 off initial purchase making new average cost percentage equal-$%.

This rounds it down to about three full week periods which we multiply by $2 or ~$6 spent within this timeframe; however due rounding errors, if counted precisely would actually amount closer around $6 plus another half ($1), making roughly $(~6)+($1) altogether equaling near $7 but still depending significantly upon exact calculation methodology applied here as discussed earlier don\u2019t forget!
