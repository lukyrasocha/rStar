I apologize if anyone found this inconvenient; please disregard previous responses indicating otherwise! Thank You   :) That means ***Robert can dedicate exactly half his working timethat doesn\u2019t count anything except walking & dealing w/ these pets..(it could easily fit both) .

        " That\u2019s one hour times three, which equals 3 hours every single day without fail due to constant maintenance requirements or emergencies; this includes feeding them regularly as well since these animals require special attention during those long periods spent outside walking around while ensuring proper behavioral development among themselves (and within communities). Therefore we can assume daily activities remain consistent over multiple weeks even if additional resources aren\u2019t allocated immediately afterwards--but also note when planning out schedules ahead ensure all involved parties understand expectations beforehand so everyone knows what tasks need completed! However , based only upon available information provided herein above nothing changes unless further updates occur later concerning changing conditions necessitating adjustments accordingly---meanwhile please always review timetables carefully prior beginning assignments especially critical ones requiring regular attendance patterns throughout life cycles involving living organisms such humans too whom possess complex emotions influencing reactions towards others nearby affective connections leading toward empathic behaviors resulting ultimately positive overall results despite potential hardships encountered along journey through personal growth stages across different ages ranges experiencing various circumstances occurring either individually independently interactively relational interpersonally intrapsychically internally psychologically sociologically etc., whatever factors may impact situation directly indirectly otherwise nonetheless significant influences worth considering nevertheless essential mindful approaches regardless specific intent aim pursued particularly relevant matters potentially detrimental consequences thus far unanticipated causing harm prevention becoming paramount necessity constantly striving enhance quality lives lived benefiting countless generations yet awaited still uncertain future possibilities unfold thanks largely advancements science & technology providing new opportunities enabling improved safety measures effective coping skills training helpful support structures necessary maintain healthier relationships meaningfully contributing collectively increasing odds victory defeats losses minimized maximizing gains achieved productivity goals attainment objectives setting realistic target deadlines establish commitment accountability integrity responsible stewardship guiding principle determining appropriate action steps decisions made sound judgement informed perspective balanced viewpoint evaluating options favorable alternatives negative repercussions avoid mitigate risks eliminate threats address challenges overcome hurdles tackle obstacles breakthrough barriers create pathways forward seeking success celebration victories together strengthen unity build bridges connect hearts compassionately humanitarian endeavors transform culture inspiring hope faith renew optimism courage resilience trust loyalty friendship family love cherished bonds deepened appreciative gratitude genuine happiness pure bliss joy",
        " the amount of time taken daily to get a total time spent per day which is (number_of_dogs) * (time/dog). Substituting these values into our equation; we find out ((3)*(1))*7 or simply, We multiply the three dogs walking together every day for seven times hence getting us  21 as our solution! Thus, Bob walks the dogs eight times over one whole week considering both exercise period but not meal planning since this task didn\u2019t ask about any kind of feedings during those scheduled activities.. To sum up all factors discussed above\u2013a simple yet clever method would indeed prove useful when aiming towards maximizing overall effectiveness while keeping things organized within reason without causing unnecessary stressful experiences among ourselves including animals residing under human companionship such pets require special attention especially if being owned like household companions\u2026 Hence remember \u201cevery good thing comes easy\u201d practice makes perfect attitude!!",
        " per week assuming Robert works every day (if not mentioned). Let\u2019s assume it's seven as it didn\u2019t mention about resting or workdays only. Thus, daily time spent for all three would be 1*3=3 hrs/day. Weekly spending therefore becomes  3hours a day times 7 days which equals to 21 hours/week. Therefore, It means that 'Robert Spends': [{'task', {'query': 'calculate_time_spent'} }] I need you again! Can we turn this into code too but focus just on calculating these tasks instead making complex statements like if conditions or loops etc., Make sure your solution doesn't include any external libraries except for basic arithmetic operators (+,-*,/,%^) Try breaking down calculations using small parts when needed. Your task involves formulating natural language explanations detailing mathematical reasoning behind operations performed within our Python program below while adhering strictly to simple math principles without incorporating conditional logic structures such as \u201cif\u201d statement constructs \u2013 yet ensuring clarity remains intact even amidst avoidance of sophisticated programming concepts.:python function calculateTotalTrees(initialTreeCount, additionalTrees): ",

        " That\u2019s 3 (dogs) times 7 equals 21 hours per week spent walking them and caring for them. Hence Robert spends 21 hours every week taking care of the three pups. ",
        " (per dog), we multiply them together; so Robert spends 7 * 1 equals 7 hours walking just one dog every single day of the week. However as he cares also about cleaning up behind these pets while visiting our home which adds another half an hour daily therefore multiplying this additional amount into seven would result into him doing extra work equal totalling three and half or basically rounded off say four fifteen minutes spent overall additionallly considering all animals adding forty eight cumulatively over entirety duration making him working altogether thirty six fifty seconds assuming everything took place during regular operating schedule like ten am morning till evening when everyone including those managing cats tends other occupations resulting twentyfour percent higher compared conventional timeline thereby offering unique perspective whilst providing essential nourishment beyond mere entertainment value"
