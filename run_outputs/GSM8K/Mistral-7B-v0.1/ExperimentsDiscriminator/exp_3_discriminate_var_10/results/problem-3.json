Since Robert decided not every night but only once a weekdays, we subtract those twice because both Saturdays can count towards bing_sleep.\r\rDetermine how much additional time Robert gets based off sleep. Twice if you consider him going straight to homework without considering bathroom breaks; otherwise just add .nineteen(one ninth) hour extra due to occasional bathroom break.[^1]He goes to bed late enough to finish up any necessary work beforehand[^2].

Thus during one full week (from Monday through Sunday) he spent  7 days/week * 3 hours/day = <<6*7=42>>42 hrs/week reading books. Time dedicated towards these activities over three sessions per week would amount  into   3 nights/week *(TV & Reading)=<<3*(42+42)=252>>252hours combined session per week. Over eight whole weeks, all such practices put together equal 8weeks * 252hrs/week = 2016 overall minutes.

Doing 8(days)* 6(hours)+ 8*(days)(3 hrs)= 48+(24). That means both calculations result into exactly the same answer..

Also let us determine how much time goes into him doing activities other than sitting still . It was noted earlier that if one decided not only going through exercising but also engaging oneself intellectually it could help reduce risks linked back towards health related issues like stroke or Alzheimer\u0092 s disease ..

Since we know that makes sense, according to the question if this happens three times a week multiplied over eight weeks would mean him engaging sixteen times altogether (because you multiply both factors). It means all together across those eighteen weeks; multiplication can easily help us find out exactly what amount totals into that value\u2013which comes down here when using simple math operations like addition or subtraction depending upon whether things add up well enough within our context \u2013but not quite yet since only part(a) hasn\u2019t been solved so far!
