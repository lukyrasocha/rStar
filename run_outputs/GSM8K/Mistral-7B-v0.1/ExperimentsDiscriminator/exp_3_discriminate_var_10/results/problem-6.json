Calculate the combined price for both the hat and the jacket. That sum is 17 + 78 equal ninety-five dollars ($95), which divided into half yields forty seven fifty fifths (or simply \\( \\frac{47}{2} \\) twenty point zero five ) . Multiply this result above together , resulting inthe whole thirty one ten twos (\\(31\\times\\dfrac{2}{2}\\)) sixty fifteen. Add all these sums up : plus eighteen for headgear plus eleven\u2014zero fours (.11)+seventy--eight for outerwear\u00a0for coat+ninety five over halves=three hundred eleven thousand, one hundred thirty two cents($311.32). Thus we determine the totallcostoftheuniformtobe$311pointthreeloudandtwo cents(\\$(311.32)). ",
        " is 3 x 17 = 51 dollars. To find out what we spend altogether if buying both items together per unit price (hat+jacket), add their prices; this would amount to 51 + 17=68 dollar units/pieces combinedly. You can assume the same principle when you get asked about averages because finding or calculating them also involves addition first before dividing afterwards since adding up numbers means combining quantities into one single entity. This way our next task becomes easier which entails determining the worthiness behind knowing exactly how all components come under different umbrellas namely 'total_cost', but still related enough such instances demand comprehension beyond mere accumulation like factorization too hence why teachers always remind us not just count everything separately yet understand grouping behaviors during classroom discussions! Here goes another tip mentioned previously though never explicitly stated thus far perhaps due lack adequate emphasis prior occurrences\u2014divide anything obtained through multiplication processes back onto itself twice whenever required subsequently distributing individual parts within those compound formulations accordingly ensuring equal representation among involved elements maintain unity amidst diversity throughout entire sequence operations performed sequentially according chronological order observed tradition dictates ensure consistency amongst participants contributing towards common goal ultimately enhancing overall efficiency maximizing effectiveness optimum performance levels achieving desirable targets satisfactorily satisfying requisites meeting expectations fulfillment requirements without fail surpass limitations constraints exceed boundaries confines overshoot margins comfortably secure positions elevated statuses promotional advancement ascents leaps forward strides progress made tangible real world application scenarios becoming reality everyday life experiences beneficial impact profitable outcome yield success reward rewards hard work dedication commitment efforts invested time dedicated passion shared endeavors collective achievements celebrated milestone victories recognition honored titles accolades awarded awards celebratory events held festivities memorable moments cherished memoir legacy preserved forever leaving indelible marks upon universe echo timeless impressions reverberating across dimensions space continua spanning eternity transcending temporal limits infinity boundless scope unlimited potential infinite possibilities myriads manifold opportunities abounding abundant resources copious wealth vast riches opulence affluence luxuriance sumptuousness lavish extravagance splendid splendour splendor magnificent majestic grandiose immense great large huge hugely tremendous extraordinary exceptional remarkable notable significant important crucial vital essential critical",
        " costs of the hat and jacket. Add them up first; we get 17 + 51= 68 . Divide this sum by their quantity which equals 68 / 2 = 34 ,This means the price per item (each pair) when averaged out would equal our third value here(pants). Since all items need to add together into one full set or 'uniform', you can also just multiply that single unitary amount directly. Therefore multiplying back once again totals us up to our required result ;  51+34*2= 119 . This was your solution before adding any further complexity onto it but since I read through these instructions multiple time prior checking my previous logic flow against yours.. My math teacher always says \u201d don\u2019t fall victim over recalculation!\u201d To avoid repetitive calculation check below instead : Let X represent HAT_PRICE & Y JACKET PRICE AND Z PANT_PRICE THEN THE SUM OF ALL THREE IS NORMALLY ADDITIONALLY NOTED INFORMATION BASED UPON OUR NEW GIVEN ENTRY WHERE REQUIRED SYSTEM RESULT WOULD BE FINAL TOTAL UNIFORM COST OR ASSESSMENT COEFFICIENT BY SAMPLE PROBABILITY DICTIONARY MAPPING WITH VALID DATA SET EVALUATION FOR SUCH SPECIFIC SECTORS/CONTEXT UNDER CONTRAST EXAMPLES ONLY IF NECESSARY TO DO SO \u2026 Here GOOD LUCK !!! And no worries sir......... Your reply doesn \u2019 t seem like what i asked initially... Try reading carefully next try !!!! ",
        " / 2 = 34 dollars. Add these amounts together for their total value. This sum is 17 + 51 + 34 = 102. Thus each set costs 102 dollars; this corresponds to option C ($10).  "
