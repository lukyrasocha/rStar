Subtract the sum up above without marie\u2019s part ((3+12)). Which ends being 15 minus zero resulting into just fifteen cookes. Fifteen multiplied with its one count per single unit since everyone gets only 85grams of food inside it would equate to 15x85which results to three hundred twentyfive culinary units divided through seventy plus seven grammertions .

Combining both days, we can see that Mary ate 6 cookies on Monday plus 60 cookies on Tuesday equal to 66 cookies altogether within these three days. To find out exactly how many Calories Mary consumed over Barbara during this period, let\u2019s first calculate Barbara\u2019s intake. We know that barbara took away 3+12= 15 cookies completely across Saturday and Sunday. When you multiply it by the daily nutrition value\u2014let alone multiplying by only one digit numbers makes easy calculation \u2014the result becomes quite evident : Bakerie de Maria consomme donc 85*15\u00d72=2550Calories suppl\u00e9mentaires comparativement \u00e0 Barbra entre le samedi et dimanche. As such, when compared against Barbara who hasn\u2019t indulged past noon; meaning every single cook counties just fall onto our lap ,without need any fancy math .

        ", meaning they together ate 9 cookies (total consumption) or about 9 * 85 = <<9*85=765>>765 calories. On Tuesday, because Mariaa ate 60 cookies while barbara just one; They collectively devoured only 61 cookies this time around, amounting roughly to 61 * 85 = <<61*85=5185>>5185 kcals worth altogether. Compute the cumulative difference in daily intake for both women over these dual instances. Barbaras entire ingestion was approximately equivalent to consuming no lesser than half what their combined weekly totals resulted upward. Specifically put, it equated closer either way but certainly not below unto being exactly sixty percent lower relative to all fourteen hundred forty calorific units collected via shared sustenance during said interval. Thus our solution lies within those sixteenths per centages bracket bound above such quantified threshold values whilst maintaining precision understnndning amid fluctuation ranges attributed largely owing factors like varied nourishment specificities contributing differential dietary implications subsequently affectttng overall nutritional profiles across individuals exhibiting differnt genetic predispositions influencing metabolism rates thereby impactsing respective energy balance equations thus facilitating variegations amongst diverse body types manifesting different physiological responses towards food processing mechanisms resulting varying degrees/intensity levels observable through distinct physical phenomena observed primarily among subjects possessinbg unique attributes reflective upon certain health conditions associated potentially stemmingfrom disorders caused purely due environmental effects whereas other forms could perhapstrace back further deeper into ancestral lineage roots linking generically inheritor traits linked directly related mainly whithd individual\u2019s genealogy history spanning decades possibly even millenia yet remaining closely entwined wth current living environment dynamics playing significant roles shaping contemporary human development patterns despite absenceof any clearcut distinction separatig out distinc influences attributable soletil singular sources originating entirely independentlywithout reference thereto interconnections existent bettwen various elementsincluding social determinantsfactorsinterrelatedamong countlessothersimpactting life experiences leading ultimatelytowards desired outcome goals predicattional assumptions madeassumptionsaboutpast behaviour trends projectedforwardwardsinto future scenarios expectedbasedupon prior historicalobservations making sense",

Hence their combined consumption equals (510+5100) + (255 + 1020), thus equalling {6610} kcal. To find out who consumed fewer calories we subtract Barbara\u2019s intake from Mike's intake because it was asked whose amount consumed less or whether any difference occurred . Thus calculating the result becomes ((Mary Total Caloric Consumption)-(Barbara Total Caloric Consumption)). [(6610)] \u2013 [{(255)+{1020}=1275]} ,thus rendering us [(6610)\u2014({1275})]=5335 KCAL. It can hence conclude that since Michaela had higher food/calorie uptake compared to Barrabari during these time frames this renders them having different amounts of calorie absorptions ; meaning no person among either one would display lower individual quantity when contrasting against what remained visible through data collection within this question context / scenario structure.

        " 5 * Barbara's cookies eaten on Tuesday; hence, it would mean 5 * 12= <<5*12=60>>60 cookies consumed on this day. To calculate barbara\u2019s daily intake we multiply its amount per weekdays multiplied by the corresponding cookies count; i.e., (Caloric value/cookies) X Cookie consumption quantity for both Mondays+ Wednesdays. That implies Calorie_intakes[Barbara]=(calorific content / onecookie)*Mary(totalmonday)+MaryTueDay(Total); Here all values can be substituted respectively such that Calorie_intakes[Barbara]=((85)/onecookie)*CookieCountFromOneCookieAndMoreAdaptationsForBothDays [calculated above]; This yields BarbaretakeninCalorySummary= ((85)(6))+(85\u00d760)=  420+5100= 5520 Calories.
