To calculate percentage increases/decreases we use absolute values so subtract off any differences which become important afterwards; i mean if someone wanted double their income just knowing percentages wouldn\u2019t matter because % growth didn\u2019t take place unless all else stayed constant.. We cannot divide numbers directly without being able add ones together beforehand however , subtraction helps us identify similarities amongst different quantities while multiplication combines elements within single units simultaneously through addition operation involving both original variables involved hence reducing complexity further still\u2026 However division allows direct comparison via ratios rather easily comparing results across varying amounts\u2013in our case taking account individual votes per candidate versus overall vote counts respectively thus simplifying complex expressions using simpler methods allowing quick comparisons made possible even under constraints provided throughout examples above including voting scenarios mentioned earlier related specifically towards elections held annually nationwide!
