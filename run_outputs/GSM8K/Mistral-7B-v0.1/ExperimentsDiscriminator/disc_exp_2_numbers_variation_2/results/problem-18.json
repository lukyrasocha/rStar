However this pattern keeps continuing till fourth level we achieve almost ~95 % only , fifth level reaches full max i.e.,100% .

Next find Audreys score compared to requirements using proportions; set up proportion as follows ; actual value over target range equals obtained question count divided into possible values times fraction needed above perfect mark; plug numbers in equation like so 0.056(58)/(.01)(58+(ans))=(answer sought). Solving yields ans =~1; round off result keeping whole integers since only full quantities accepted , therefore Audree requires solving for int part of equations yielding cwnt_needed=-(-5), which when negated returns positive integer nncty->ceiled amount wrt floor function resultsin ceil[nc]_tcy==numCWantted ==ceil[-x]+1>= numCNeeded >=floor[x]..
