Thus, there seem to likely be close to or just shy off being 56 birds remaining outrightly within said yard space presently.

Next add these fledging survivors into our account -> Initial count was about  34 + additional 30 arriving --> approx equal to 64 while accepting fractional representations used earlier would lead you to exact counts so if needed adjustments may follow based upon contextual requirement.. But still , this kinda counting usually isn\u2019t too accurate especially when small units interact often enough without distinct separation etc...but overall understanding stays same regardless slight variations brought out due differences either quantitative or qualitative factors involved!! :) As such my reasoning process takes us pretty close considering averages mentioned above . Also understand though calculations involve rounding up slightly might make sense sometimes depending situations ! Finally remember things change over time; animals don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stay static forever within confines limited oneself boundaries defined solely numerical terms ..
