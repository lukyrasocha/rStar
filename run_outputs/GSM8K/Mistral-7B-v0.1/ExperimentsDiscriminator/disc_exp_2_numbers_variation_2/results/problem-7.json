Doing this calculation again for Tuesday, we find out that if she was still consuming 5 times what her sister consumed, it means Sue consumed 5 * 12 = 60 cookes on Tuesday because her sister only ate 12 cookies. Add up all these values together, you get 40+60=100 cookies altogether throughout both days (in addition to Sunday), considering no other data provided about Saturday or Friday consumption. Next, add up Suzie\u2019s daily cookie intake along similar lines getting 40(on Mon)+60(on Tue) = 100; hence Sue's overall Cookie Consumption till last known time i.e., until close off sunday evening is estimated equal to ten hundred cookies during same span assuming their weekly consistency remains unchanged without any additional details available pertaining to different/extra occurrences outside mentioned timelines across subsequent Sundays etc..

Similarly calculate for Sue\u2019s sister; 8 cookies would mean burning off only about ~488 calories while 12 means around 732 calories altogether so this sums up into almost 732 \u2013 488 == 244 calories.

Therefore it translates roughly equivalent calculation thus answering your query directly without going deeper via formulaic approach considering practical context provided here i.e. consuming & burn rates linked within problem statement itself . Consequently concluding approximate count suggests considerable intake difference when assessing just numerical perspective alone hence better framed interpretation might encompass qualitative aspect too beyond simple digits display resulting higher consumption rate attributed evidently favorable towards consumer preference aligning suitably well fitting subjective analysis parameters expectedly yield comprehensive overall insight rather confined strictly adherent merely arithmetic computation possibly undermining subtle underlying nuances potentially missed upon strict numeracy orientated evaluations sole emphasis predominantly restricted tangibly quantified results narrowly scoping potential implications neglectful indirect contributors otherwise accountancy precision lacky thereby inducing partial depictions failing holistic apprehension especially critical scenarios such metabolism variabilities fluctuation dynamics interrelative dietary habit particularities further complex determinant factors influencing energy disbursement absorption regulation essential contemplation necessary ensuring correctness verification uphold factual credibility integrity crucial avoidance errors omission anomalies accuracy deviation misinterpretational infallibility paramountty demand exactitude nonnegotiables therefore precise methodologies adopted vitalise validity preservation fidelity authentic assurance indispensability integral successful resolution necessitating diligence rigorous scrutiny attending care quality standard expectations safeguard against erroneous mistakes jeopardizing confidential data privacy concerns ethical consider",

You cannot directly compare apples(calorie count per item type vs calories ingested). What needs fixing here -- Calculate Sarah\u2019s net calorie difference using actual units; avoid conflating different quantities such as 'cookies'. Here's what works best: Consider separate calculations based upon individual items rather than converting all into cookies equivalents since calorific value can vary distinctively according to food categories.(Hint): Start with calculating individual cookie consumption amounts through respective multiplication (cookie counts multiplied by their specific energy content), sum them accordingly for comparative analysis against overall differences witnessed due to varied dietary patterns established during lab sessions focused on metabolism studies within high school Chemistry courses.

Sue would eat twice this amount because she also doubled up; hence, she consumes (5*2) * 20 = 200 cookies across both Mondays. To find out how many extra calories Sue consumed relative to her sister calculate their respective caloric consumption first before finding the difference. Firstly compute Susan\u2019s daily intake \u2013 This involves calculating the individual numbers which equate to Sarah's share using multiplication or division depending upon whether you know the initial value or vice versa. Given no such context here, we can only assume linear increase due to direct relationship provided i.e., \u2018she eats half again\u2019 signifying multiplicative proportionality not additive increment like `half_times(initial)` operation might suggest otherwise. Hence, if X represents the unknown additional quantity being asked about , applying inverse operations results yielding ~X=~((double)(whole))*(increase factor), representing doubling followed immediate halving essentially returning original values back resulting equivalent quantities .

Hence both collectedively consumed altogether almost equals or above this amount due tot around sixty ninth percent ([Total Consumed]/[Average Total]). Thus if you wanted to estimate what percentage [the difference] would roughly fall beneath halfway ,you could use basic division logic here [[a Half% divided into Four Equals Twenty Fifth %]] because ((1/2)/2)=(.5/.2)=[(Twenty fifth) X=Percentage Difference]. As such when calculating said Percentage differences : You see your individual average share comes down closer towards .33%.

Hence, compared to her sister who consumed ((20)*(61)) = 1220 calories; Sue consumed twice their combined meal which translates into ((100)*(61)) = 6100 Calories.

We conclude That over both days \u2013 i.e., throughout one entire weekend \u2014 Susie obtained (or ingested) ___calories, whereas Sarah accumulated/obtained just __ calories .

Total cookies consumed by Sue across both days equals 40 (Monday) plus 60 (Tuesday), so Suede consumes 40+60=<<40+60=100>>100 cookies over both days. To find out the amount of calories per cookie multiply this quantity with the provided unit weight i.e.,  61 Cal/Cookie which results into   100*61 = <<100*61=6100>>6100 Calories ingested over these period; whereas during the entire interval, her sibling intakes only 6*(8 Cookie(Mon)+12 Cookies(Tue)) equaling 6x20Cookies equalling 120Cal or around half the consumption made by Susan thus leaving aside doubtful amounts leading us towards conclusion that differences exists not less but rather significant thereby providing our ultimate solution statement indicating estimated difference within range ranging round about 6100 \u2013120 Caloric Units translating finally unto exact figures namely ",

Total cookies consumed during these two consecutive dates are equal to sum([c_monday]+[c_tue])=[c_m]plus,[c_tu]; therefore equals [Ctotal]=sum:[c_(tot)] which would amount upwards to approximately  6000Calories. Determine whether or not it was indeed better according to this parameter since Suzie consumed lesser amounts compared to her Sister who acquired roughly only half the quantity due solely because Suzy opted for larger servings . Considering all factors involved including intake size/frequency , energy cost etc you can conclude accordingly without comparing individual quantities directly rather look into greater picture based upon contextual information mentioned earlier regarding their food consumption patterns & preferred portions sizes respectively before making any assumptions purely off numerical values obtained thus far so considerate approach towards determining comparative value considering various aspects associated herewith also taking previous observations stated within current prompt scenario whilst keeping them apart alongside respective dietary choices made amongst parties concerned..
