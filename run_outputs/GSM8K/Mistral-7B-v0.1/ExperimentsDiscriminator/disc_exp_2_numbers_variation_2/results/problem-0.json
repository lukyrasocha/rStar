Therefore you can conclude that jame ends up covering about fifty four hundred meters over approximately sixteen weeks if no holidays come along.(since most people work only close to twelve hours a time i would reckon even less than forty pounds.) Thus making our first approximation as; Fifty-four thousand zeroes minus nineteen...which comes down pretty neatly when rounded off thus :Forty Four Thousand Three Hundred Ninety Nine !!!A good estimation indeed ..And your math may prove right so here goes ...One way round my brain was just like ; One sixty plus another seventeen!
