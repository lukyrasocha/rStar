However let us consider any other possible scenario such 'an oversized animal'. Consider another situation where these creatures might move slower or faster compared directly onto grassland terrain versus wet marshy soil types..

Given that every hour a single kangaroo covers about 1 speed unit distance along the highway, we need them covering twice as long distance because our rate is halved when comparing to turtles. Therefore, if one kilometer per second was considered constant, let's say both distances covered during those times equate themselves; thus considering only units rather than specific lengths makes sense here i.e., four kilograms equals twenty-two metric tons. However based solely upon proportions, not absolute measurements; which tells us essentially what remains unchanged despite multiplicative factors applied towards different entities participating respectively...

Therefore, since these new speeds are equal parts slowed down compared to the first set up(where K was our normal average rate) It would logically make sense that any time value here becomes twice as large because you went double distance but traveled both sets of creatures at approximately one fourth faster rates when looking backward.(As I said above...this assumes all other aspects such road width etc stays constant). Thus if taking four animals who initially move quickly covers X amount of ground over Y period..five times ten percent less fast moving critters would likewise cover around 1X portion while doing about what seems reasonable considering typical physics laws based off past experience(at least among those willing participants participating within certain controlled circumstances during previous studies upon which researchers heavily relied....and thus probably assumed without fully realizing.)

Therefore, since slow turtles go only halfway per hour compared against what our hypothetical kangaroon could cover during its journey, using rate*time=distance approach, these slower creatures need approximately double their required amount i.e., around ~22 hours when working collectively rather than individually because every pair consists both elements contributing towards movement but not doubling up simultaneously like initial case involving faster ones.
