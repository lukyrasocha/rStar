With one complete school term being equal to approximately four years here on earth, we can assume one month would roughly account for about three quarter months since half as long time period fits into our concept better than full periods). Therefore, considering Mars having almost doubled lengthened rotations per solar orbit compared to terrestrial bodies like the Moon or Venus due its elliptical path around Sun leading less frequent transit points visible during certain lunar phases/earth cycles when observing planetary motions including retrograde motion patterns; this means it takes longer for us even though speed was faster because planets don\u2019t rotate uniformly but rather slower which also explains why sunsets happen later before midnight regardless whether any object moves across night sky earlier according current understanding within heliocentrism theory regarding timing relationships involving celestial positions relative against background stars etc.). That implies although audrie took several weeks passing semester examiners along wtih students themselves studying various scientific disciplines using textbooks written over decades back centuries ago whose contents may differ slightly depending upon author preferences whereas others continue refining methods used henceforth thereby potentially altering results based new insights found afterwards thus creating controversies surrounding accuracy issues while attempting regressive reconstructions aiming toward simplifying complex phenomena yet never fully succeeding despite best efforts made towards resolving disputes among scholars worldwide concerning validity claims raised throughout history everlastingly debated amongst academics everywhere still lingering amidst contemporary society until present age..

Since this sum exceeds the target required score; audrey needs less than eighteen point something instead out ten remaining possible items chosen since only integers can count as individual responses.(the desired value rounded downwards would work here, iff such choice existed among all options offered!)(a nonnegative integer multiple within their feasible range also works but makes no sense logically speaking\u2026even though it satisfies mathematical constraints exactly.).
