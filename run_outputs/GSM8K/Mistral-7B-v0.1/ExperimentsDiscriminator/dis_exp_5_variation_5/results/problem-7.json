Each cookie contains roughly 200 calories; thus, all these cookies amount to a total of  33 cookies * 200 calories/cookie=6600 calories during those two days. Since one cookie provides around 200 energy units or calories, it would mean that Sarah took in significantly fewer calories when compared to what Suzie obtained through consumption. Hence, according to our computations, Susie consumed lesser amounts of calories if you compare their intake rate directly without considering other factors like metabolic activity among others.

        " many cookies as her sister again on Tuesday, which means she eats another 2 * 13 = 26 cookies. Altogether, Suz consumes 20 + 26 = 46 cookies over both days. Since one cookie contains around 200 calories (depending on its type), this equates to about 200*46= 9,200 calories consumed altogether by Susan. Meanwhile, her sister only took half amount or roughly 7/4th part (= 1+2) worth of energy during these sessions i.e.,  2*(5+13)= 36 calories; thereby creating quite a gap! Thus their combined differential intake stands closer to nearly [((9_200)-(36))]/4^% difference =~ ((9 _ , 20)+(- 0 %)). Therefore considering individual dietary requirements, varying cookie recipes etc \u2013 we estimate them apart being just above 'moderately higher'. Hence our choice would best fit here\u2014between mere moderate divergence ('< |end_of_text| >') & significantly greater variances (.('>' .). This calls for further clarification based upon exact nutritional facts available via lab tests!) Your calculations seem incorrect.

While during this timeframe ,her friend only consumes (5+13)=<<5+13=18>>18 cookies but still falls short when compared against what Sue manages to eat(since one set meal contains double quantity). Thus; we can conclude that : Total amount of calories Sue consumers is greater than or equal to that of her besties.. Since I haven\u2019t asked about anything other than their intake values\u2026 hence no difference could arise if it wasn\u2019t provided otherwise \u2026so let us move ahead without any further analysis/calculations!

Thus overall, over these first two days ,each girl consumed exactly same amount i.e., their totals cancelled out! Therefore regardless what happens during any future date sill count per cookie consumption only .

Altogether, Sue ate 4000 + 5200 which equalled 4000 + 5200 = 9200 calories over all weekend long (both Saturday through Sunday). Meanwhile it was determined earlier during this problem description that Sue\u2019s cousin snacking habits amount to far less overall since their quantities weren't multiplied by nearly anything greater than one; thus these numbers remain unaffected when compared together via simple subtraction techniques using basic arithmetic methods outlined prior above within parentheses surrounding said calculations \u2013 namely \u201c[(20+26)\u00d7200]\u201d minus \"[(5+13)*200]\" resulting ultimately equaling simply \"(46x200)-((18)(200))\" providing us finally arrived upon what every child growing into adulthood hopes might come true most often\u2026 well beyond mere trivial knowledge acquired due solely having learned about such things beforehand!

Multiplying this amount by the calorie content per cookie gets us a combined consumption of 63 * 200 = 12,600 calories.

Altogether over both sessions, Sue nibbled through about 26+20= <<26+20=46>>46 carbohydrate packets or items during the weekend period under consideration. Since every packet possesses around 200 units of energy, all together, such dietary consumption constituted roughly 46 * 200= <<46*200=9200>>9,200 kilojoules worth of nutrients across Sunday and Monday! Conversely, since we know her sibling managed to eat only seven biscuits collectively throughout those very identical calendar periods ($$2\\times(5+1)=2\\times{6}=12$$), it can thus fairly deduced that while gobbling down just $$P_B=1\\cdot200=200$$ essential compounds daily (!!!important stuff!!!) within said interval frame, Suzy herself guzzled almost triple that amount per occasion ($\\boxed{~3} \\cdot ~200=$ $\\boxed{~600}$ kcal) along exactly the same span $(Monday$-${Wednesday})$ which happened to happen not long before our timeframe ran out!...

Also note that since you haven't supplied enough details regarding uncle sara 's intake across weekdays unlike your previous example thus I am going ahead without factoring any daily variables considering all instances into my calculation but keep in mind , this could impact results depending upon further specifications   Given their ratio remains constant throughout weeks hence taking only the specified values during particular dates being used hereinfor calculating baseline differences ; let us first focus solely on cookesheet totals over respective time frames viz Day M & N Herewith :",

Thus, Sue\u2019s additional consumption comes down only to those extra seven packets compared to what was taken during one whole day i.e., seventy eight minus twenty equals fifty six fewer packages or sixty four excess amounts(packages containing 200 calories). Therefore when converted into energy equivalent form its conversion factor using multiplication results thirty three thousand one hundred ninety six kilocalorie difference overall.(as per context mentioned about \u201chow many more\u201d part.)

Subtraction hence yields us Susan consuming additional/extra ingesting 9200 \u2013 3600 = <<9200-3600=5600>>5600 extra calories overall across both Days relative to her Sister.
