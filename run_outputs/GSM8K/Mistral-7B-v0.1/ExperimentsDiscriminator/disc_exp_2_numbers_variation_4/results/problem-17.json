To find out how far he would go in one hour, we simply use the formula Distance=Speed*Time which equals D=(V)(T), therefore; Total hours spent travelling when going nonstop over three consecutive days times duration per day as follows ;(D)=[(42km/hr)][((24 hrs)/day)](3days);This means :Total hours multiplied together results below [(42)*[24]*3] resulting to [H]=3024 HoursofTraveltime. Next calculate distance covered using value above derived. We apply here same relationship used earlier but solve it rearranged thus ,Distance Travelled=[KM](hoursSpent)=totalDays\u00d7durationPerDay hence .(D)=[{3024h}].We furthermore derive our actual numerical equivalent by replacing previous variables stated or substituting them appropriately i.e.; {D}={([speedinkph])}.Now let\u2019s consider another variable Wrepresenting percentages related to distances achieved throughout journey ie., PercentageReached={distanceCompleted}/{[FullDistancesFromAlaskatoTexas]}andwewillsubthesevaluelaterhereafterMultiplying both sidesofthisequationwiththeconvenient factor100to convertourratiointopercentagesresultsbelowPercentageComplete{(D)}=%=>({distancecompleted})/({{fulldistancetextanalaska}).Soletusreplaceabovevariablesforactualvaluesorsubstituteacordingilybecomesfollowingly%;%complete=-(%traveled){/}{fulllengthfromtexastoalaska};Note:-Nearestintegervalueisassumedbecausecalculationswouldyielddecimalswhichareredundantwhenexpressedaspercentssointialconditionsmayresultinecontaining decimalexpressions whichtheusercan round off before inserting intotabledatafinalanswersoundlike:(%)...\\n",

Substitute these values back into our equation : Time per journey / Hours worked weekly \u00d7 Weeks annually Which converts roughly 2 weeks out of year off work leading us upto only slightly below about ten percent (.88).
