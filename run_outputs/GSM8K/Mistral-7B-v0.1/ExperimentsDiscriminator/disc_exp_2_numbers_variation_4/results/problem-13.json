        " Jeremy saw 68 birds initially. When Jeremy throws the stone it frightens off 1/4 or one quarter (one out of every four) of those birds. Hence calculate what quantity corresponds to this fraction by multiplying 68 / 4 which equals 17 since 1/4 times any amount X can also be written as dividing 'X' into 4 equal parts -- i.e., you want just ONE part but not ALL FOUR when referring to fractions so divide instead of multiply here). Following this calculation we know these numbers represent similar quantities however using different operations \u2013 division vs multiplication reveal distinct amounts due its operation nature; hence don\u2019t directly convert result via equivalent numerical expression unless requested otherwise!
