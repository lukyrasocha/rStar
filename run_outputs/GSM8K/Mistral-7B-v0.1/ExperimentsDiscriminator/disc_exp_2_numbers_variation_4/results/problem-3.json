Determine monthly totals; because it appears we need figures based off one period longer than described , choose instead our next interval upward within the parameters provided\u2014that would mean calculating over sixteen periods or months rather than four .

This makes sense because multiplying any series involves combining groups whereas addition simply counts individual items regardless whether they belong inside group sets beforehand while subtraction removes specific quantities instead subtracting oneself until desired figures align correctly which leaves others unaffected unlike division however division splits totals amongst equal parts thus separating initial entities further apart resulting into various sums such examples below demonstrate why certain methods produce diverse outcome numbers even though starting conditions remain constant throughout all stages despite variations made along journey due sole reliance upon mathematical operations performed sequentially rather than interdependence used within logic chain connecting related facts/relationships linked somehow meaningfully relevant information processed logically without relying heavily exclusively based purely numerologic interpretations hence rendering ambiguous understanding regarding exact implications behind particular actions taken specifically referring direct cause effect correlational analyses conducted via statistical examination evaluating pertinent evidence gathered over periods involving manipulations alteration variables adjustments changes observed trends interpreted effects analyzed relationships quantified compared evaluated summarized presented conclusions drawn reached assumptions formed generalized theories proposed hypothesis formulated experiments designed tested data collected measured calculated computed modeled simulated visualized graphical depicted statistically represented narrated documented described explained elucidated understood acknowledged appreciated recognized celebrated commemorated cherished valued applauded thanked remembered honored admired congratulated saluted extolling lauding glorifying exalting praising uplifting inspiring motivating stimulating energizing empowering enabling fostering cultivating nurturing encouraging promoting development supporting progress building strengthening fortifying reinforcing establishing creating constructing founding originating initiating instigating launching unleashing activating triggering setting off causing bringing about generating producing supplying delivering providing offering making available facilitating assisting helping handholding holding sustaining perpetuating prolonging extending expanding maintaining preserving keeping alive reviving awakening renewing restoring refreshing regenerating resurrecting recovering reminiscing remembering recognizing recalling reliving experiencing reproducing retaining revis",

Over the course of one month Jim ends up using  84*14 = 1176 minutes Which converts into 19 hours rounded off. His sleeping habits shouldn\u2019t affect your calculations since its not mentioned anywhere what amount of energy gets used just lying down vs sitting upright.
