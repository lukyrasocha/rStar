True or False? Justify your answer briefly based on secure communication protocol implementation principles. [/INST]From my understanding, using Bluetooth technology includes security measures intended to protect data as devices communicate wirelessly. Secure Simple Pairing (SSP), introduced in Bluetooth version 2.1+EDR, incorporates Elliptic Curve Diffie Hellman (ECDH) keys which allow two devices to create shared session encryption keys automatically and safely. Once these keys are established through SSP\u2019s process, known also as \u201cpairing,\u201d both parties agree upon common secret parameters without revealing either side\u2019s private information during transmission. This mechanism inherently supports the creation of 'unique key pairs.' However, ECDH itself doesn't generate truly new cryptographic material exclusively for every connection but rather derives what might conceptually look like \u2018session keys,\u2019 derived via asymmetric algorithms such as RSA or elliptic curve public-key techniques mentioned above, ensuring perfect forward secrecy if implemented properly. These processes enable repeated reconnections while maintaining strong confidentiality guarantees even though technically no entirely new symmetric key pairs generated specifically due to the nature of Public Key Cryptography Methodologies employed herein. Thus, within general Bluetooth implementations adhering to modern standards, true initial handshake occurrences may vary depending on specific versions, proprietary extensions, manufacturer configurations, etc., affecting potential reiterations post successful connections under different conditions including whether any explicit rescan actions occur prior to attempts of automatic retries facilitated usually managed implicitly behind application menus interfaces offering options related notably less frequently than direct interactions presumed implied erroneously non-explicitly referred explicitly below discussed.",
