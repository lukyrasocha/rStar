        " That\u2019s  3*4=$12. Because three containers costs four times as much. Therefore it would take 4x longer than this to get enough cartons if we used only their own price (this means dividing current result ($12) with the original unitary value ($\\frac{1}{4}=0.25$), so we receive our needed value). This equals roughly seven months. Dividing into quarters results nearly eight full periods or approximately six weeks since half terms often don\u2019t exist here. We still need whole units while maintaining consistency; thus keeping values rounded downwards makes sense because time cannot breakdown perfectly without remaining partial amounts which aren\u2019t considered real world applicable circumstances under normal conditions involving basic transactions such purchasing goods via traditional retail settings like supermarkets etc..
