Adding this time spent caring about one pet alone means the other also needs another 2x7 or 14 hrs/week which when combined becomes double i.e., 14+14 equals to 28 weeks altogether. Therefore we can conclude that if Matthew walks both pets daily throughout all seven days ,he spends approximately twenty eight hours every single week working diligently ensuring these puppies remain healthy! But since our original question asks only 'how long?' without specifying anything additional(such as round trips etc.)our best estimate under simplified conditions still stands hence making Matt\u2019s estimated workload equal simply; \u2018thirty four.\u2019 And thus finally presented herewith : Our Final ",

Calculate the time spent weekly or sum up over seven days \u2013 since Mathews maintains them consistently across all seven days without interruptions hence we get 2pounds*seven=14 pounds. Thus the amount of time spending walking these pups amounts to fourteen units considering eighty minutes being taken into account here means forty twenty minute increments which equate twelve hours .

Therefore, if Matthew spends twice this amount daily walking his pets due to having another animal around too then when multiplied out yields a cumulative amount over any specified period such as 'a weeks\u2019 duration.'

        " this amounting to 2 hours per dog daily. Multiply these values together (total_hours) to obtain the aggregate quantity spent every day caring for both dogs simultaneously; i.e., `Total Hours Daily Caring for Both Dogs Together equals Number of Trees times Time Per Tree`. Therefore we get Total_Hours=2Dog*2Hour/Day=Result 4 Hours Per Day Spent Care. To find out monthly usage calculate Total Weekdays in the current Month divided into Days Cared By Matthew multiplied by minutes or hours needed each day like so: Result 2x(number weeks)(weekend)+Time Needed Alone). Based on common knowledge consider months roughly containing four complete calendar weeks while not accounting for leap years when calculating results as mentioned above which yields approximately 'Month Value X Four Weeks'. Since walking pets typically happens during non-leap year months resulting our calculation being slightly off but close enough due proximity therefore approximated Final ",

Since we need to calculate this over the course of one week, multiply those four hour blocks together again but only consider seven because there are seven days in a week \u2013 Sunday through Saturday; therefore making our result seventy(70)-hour weeks worth! Finally convert them into seconds so you can visualize better if needed here ;multiplying forty eight thousand three hundred twenty six minutes or  1 layer below which would leave us still short compared against what was requested above as well . Considering all these factors put forth , your solution seems quite reasonable except maybe neglecting small details like dividing up half versus whole parts etc.. But overall logic remains valid indeed hence concluding my support onto yours accordingly .. :) ",

To find out time spent daily one can easily multiply this figure (number) per day taken into consideration as it needs work or entertainment throughout all seven days but since we want only single digit solution use multiplication up till three digits such as if you say 2 times four i get eight which falls within limit so first let us see what happens when I start counting my numbers sequentially starting from right most significant place like below\r",

Therefore find out what would happen when this routine persists continuously across seven days making it equals 4*7= <<4*7=28>>28 days/week or weeks if you wish so as asked here but I believe your question was meant 'hours', resulting in being equal to >>28<<. ",
        " (for one week). This becomes 2*2=4 hours per day for both dogs together.
