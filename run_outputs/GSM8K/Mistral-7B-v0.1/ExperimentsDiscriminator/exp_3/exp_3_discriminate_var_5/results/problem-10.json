        " we need to divide this number evenly into half (since \u2018half\u2019 implies equal division). Therefore, it results in 88 / 2 which equals 44 pupils preferring blue.

Consequently, It calculates as follows :  88 - 44 , resulting in 44 . Since only one fourth of them favour Green among their peers ; multiplying this resultant group against fractional part would provide us our first set of interested party members.. This calculation goes like this :  44/4 , thereby producing values approximately around 11(rounded off integer)who go ahead showing interest toward green coloured objects than others.

I therefore deduce that    33+44=77 pupils overall picked either red or grey as their favorite colour. Given all three colours were preferred equally among those picking anything aside from blue , so you divide     77\u00f73\u224825.6 thus approximately equalling  26 which yields to conclusion that about twenty six choose 'yellow'.
