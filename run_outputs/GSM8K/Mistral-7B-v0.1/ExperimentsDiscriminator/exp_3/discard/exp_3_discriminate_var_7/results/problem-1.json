Note I assume here you want all numbers as decimals which can occur using different rounding options if needed . You might prefer integers instead depending upon your purpose or situation requirements such as budgetary constraints etc.. However please note integer based calculations may cause slight variance when compared against float/double precision results due computation errors caused because floating point arithmetic operations cannot exactly represent fractions like half ($\\frac {1}{2}~$) , quarter($\\frac {1} {4}$, third $\\dfrac {1} {3}$, sixths $\\dfrac {1} {6}$,and other non exact division factors.)
