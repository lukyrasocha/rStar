Thus combining both days together we see Patricia ingested  35 cookies while Nancy only managed to eat eight cookies throughout the whole period under review . Considering one cook contains approximately 166 calories , let us compute firstly for Nancy who took three meals which made up exactly six servings thus 6*166 equals roughly around thousand sixty four (. Sixtyfour). Secondly look over here too discover just about same things concerning Patrizia albeit having slightly different amount consumption ; because she canceled ten services during Monday followed swiftly seven plus fifteen further amounts summing altogether equalling thirtytwo therefore producing likewise result into equally roundabout quantities but ending marginally high closer onto fortyeight hundred ..

Use subtraction operation here because we want to find out the difference in their consumption levels rather than finding a sum like it appeared earlier. Since Nancy also consumes one type per day same quantity(that would mean around half compared to Patrick\u2019s intake), calculate what fraction represents Patrica\u2018s extra expenditure/intake considering herself only since both share identical quantities i.e., split equally which means divide net resultant value mentioned before over twice representing themselves+each other\u2013the totality of them , yielding ((5810 \u2013 16*166)/2)=~672calorie unit apart or ~1248 individual servings beyond reach if you choose another methodology.

Nancy took 5 (monday) + 5 (tuesday)= 10 candies throughout those two weeks; From this point, you can start calculating what happens when someone consumes any quantity because we know every candy contains exactly 166 Calories . What happened on Saturday ?
