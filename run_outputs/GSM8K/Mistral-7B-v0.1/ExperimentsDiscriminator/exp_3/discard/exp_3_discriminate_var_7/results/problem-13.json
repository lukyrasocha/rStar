Substituting N=99 results into this term leads us with about 33 feather friends who decided not join further flight activities. This means initially all remaining ones stayed put as result implies only roughly half stay behind. Next we need to acknowledge new comers joining our flock over time; exactly 57 brave peeps landed up here recently according to provided scenario information. To reach current population simply add newly arrived batches arriving soon afterwards with previously present members still keeping calm & carrying caws resulting finally totals around ((99-33)+(57)) = approx sixty six wingbearies taking residence comfortably currently resting right outback post recent events!

Count these newly arrived birds which amounts up to 57 birds based on question details; adding this number increases overall quantity thus making us add those arriving ones too [i.e.]   Total_birds=66(remaining)+57(arrived).

That leaves him with about 33 animals remaining because 9+3=12; 9\u00d73 is around thirty four but you can\u2019t throw stones at parts of bird therefore we rounded off downward which makes it approximately like forty six since our goal here isn\u2019t precision let\u2019s round it up . About halfway through throwing these rocks , another flock arrives adding onto what remained unharmed thus bringing its amount closer towards fifty percent rather than being below ninety eight instead going above if all those thrown stones hit targets well enough too . It turns out pretty clearly during such events when multiple groups interact simultaneously without really knowing exactly who went first or second etc \u2026 however still assuming random chance plays heavily across both parties involved\u2026the outcome becomes quite different overall depending upon various factors related specifically toward timing & probability distributions among individuals within populations generally speaking anyway..

From this group, only twenty seven disappeared due to panic upon witnessing the strike.(after throwing stones out come nearly just over eighty %); however since no mention exists regarding regaining any prior individuals amongst the feather flock whilst fresh recruits converged en masse shortly post aggression toward avian residents\u2013in such cases counting what remained standing amidst chaos becomes imperative yet further elucidation might prove illuminative nonetheless.)
