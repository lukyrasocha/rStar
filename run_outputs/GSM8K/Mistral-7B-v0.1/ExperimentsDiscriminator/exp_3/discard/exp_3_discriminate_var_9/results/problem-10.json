Hence our ultimate figure stands proud as exactly twenty wielders of cheerful citrus banners sporting solace without sulfurous clouds over them nor jealousy beneath heartfelt joys among fellow companions simply sharing joy because we know colors affect mood differently across humans therefore if everyone liked only either red alone could never exist universal truth since human emotion cannot survive purely individualistic love affairs especially when emotions come together creating unity strength beyond measure let us hope harmony always rules above personal glory seekings remember happiness shared multiplies pleasure exponentially also makes memories unforgettable no single being can live happily ever after until selfless acts transform worldview embracing peace tolerance kindness compassion brotherhood respect understanding humility gratitude patience forgiveness acceptance wisdom generosity courage laughter smiles sparkle starlight moonbeam soft whispers comfort touch encouragement whisper words inspiring faith trust innocence light magic power dreams reality imagination hopes goals life lessons experience journey soul spirit nature earth energy universe heaven paradise jewel treasure infinite cosmic timeless beauty ancient traditions cultural custom belief system spiritual guide teacher friend family members loved ones beloved pet cherished animal child precious offspring dear grandchild kin relative acquaintance colleague neighbor stranger friendly alien angel divine deity guru master sage philosopher heroic warrior wise old man elder woman young lady adolescent youth teenager college student graduate professional career success business entrepreneur financial independence freedom travel adventure exploration learning discovery science technology innovation creativity artistry music composition musical performance dance ballet modern contemporary classical hip hop jazz latin pop reggae blues rock roll country folk alternative electronic digital media social networking online community interaction engagement participation civic education active citizenship environmental stewardship sust",

Hence if you subtract these last twelve people together with those having picked another colour i.e., seven and eleven persons respectively; we get sixteen individuals favoring yellow out of thirty-two pupils overall.

        " students (i.e., those not preferring blue) like green. To calculate these numbers we first subtract those that liked blue from our original count so; i.e., 32 - 16 = 16 pupils remain (who don\u2019t particularly love blue). Next, taking out just over a quarter \u2013 represented mathematically herein as dividing 'remaining children without preference towards Blue' which equals \u2018non favorite blue kids\u2019 or simply put 16 / 4 =>  4 kids dislike Green while leaving around three quarters favoring Yellow [because Total non preferred toward Blue= Non Preferred Green+ Those loving yellow] .

        " = 16 students. This leaves us with another half or 16 pupils who don't like blue (because those would still remain). Of this remainder group, one-fourth prefer green so it equates as follows; 1/4 multiplied into 16 equals 4 pupils liked Green not Blue. By subtracting both groups i.e., Those Who Liked Blue Plus Those Who Likes Gink From Total Number We Can Say That Them who Like Yellow Color Which Equals To ;(Blue ones plus green)fromtotal=(blue+green)=totale=((half)+\u00bcofthe other HALFwhichisalsoa quarter)(Total Is equal too three quarters because when you take away all four fifth partsitwillbeonefifthleftremaining.)So,(Total minus blue plus red)= ((\u00bd)/(\u00be))*(Remainder)-[(\u2153)* Remaining](By using fractions we can divide easily .andwe getthis result )",

Calculate one fourth of this remainder as those students preferred different colors other than blue or red i.e.  1/4(16)= 4 pupils liked another colour apart form Green, but since our only options here being Blue & Yellow we know these four outliers favored Red because you cannot divide equally among three choices so subtract their numbers into what remained unaccounted for therefore leaving us having concluded; Only Six Pupils Preferred the Color 'Yellow'.

Lastly we need to find out about those remaining ones(yellow), since all numbers add up to count the whole group of students ,so subtracting sums above it means simply subtraction :   16 - 4 = 12 . Therefore, twelve pupils favor Yellow as their favorite color among colors presented here. The answer is: 12.",
        " One fourth (of those not yet divided) actually favor other colors than red so it would only divide the remainder; therefore you get this calculation :  1/4(16)= 4 students love green while others prefer either red or another hue altogether as explained here : https://www.mathworksheetsland.com/elementary_algebra_calculator.php     Which means , if half already prefers blueness ; one quarter still makes up the entire amount because we subtract once but consider three times .
