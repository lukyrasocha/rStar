Next let us calculate the distance covered during these weeksly sessions using information about the length (in meter) one takes while running once forward which stands as eightyfive metres(or equivalently sixty three feet). This means when all fourteen exercises taken together accounting for fortytwo hundred twentyone meters (m or simply metre unit) worth of movement covering along the ground equals what we obtain following multiplying quantity twelve undertaken thrice upon other hand yieldingly resulting into eleven thousand seventy three complete movements measured through lengths equal thirty seven hundred six point ten zero plus another amount same size calculated above coming up fifteen thousand seven hundreds forty eight.
