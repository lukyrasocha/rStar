Thus subtracting this value yields ($(40)-(8))=$<<(40-8=32)>>32$, which means Steven only needs to pay thirty two dollars. To recap let me say...We found out about three types of calculations: Multiplication/Division, Addition/Subtraction, percentage calculation . Firstly we multiply everything needed first thing! Next divide if ever required next add likewise finally calculate percentages .. Remember I said multiplication Division addition Subtract Percentage :)",
        " would look like this: Notebook costs (3)(5) = 15; Pen costs (7)(1)= 7; Geometry Set costs (1)(8) = 8; Calculator costs (1)(10) = 10 . Adding them up gets us to get (15)+(7)+(8)+(10)=(20+15). To make sure no mistakes happened during calculation add the numbers together again ((15)-((20))=(-5); (-5)+(15)=((-5)+(5))=(0)). Add these amounts using another method,(to avoid errors while adding subtraction or reverse order rules): calculate everything above as whole amount without negative signs first ,then use parentheses around positive and minus sign outside : Subtracting results obtained from different methods makes clear if anything went wrong along way,. Finally check result once getting zero.. Since our calculations match.(Addition tableau picture below shows correct steps:) First column holds products values when multiplying factors:(First row: product value represents net payoff based upon possible outcomes before calculating probabilities), Second Column shows Sum Of Product Values From Factor Pairings That Result In Specific Net Payoffs ; Third Column Contains Frequency List showing Occurrences Or Probability With Each Outcome Combination During Trials When Multiplication Table Is Used As Guide ); Fourth Row displays Total Number Of Possible Experiment Scenarios Where All Factors Could Be Considered Together )This helps visualize combination scenarios.)To obtain probability percentage answers multiply factor pair frequency list entries next to corresponding outcome/netpayoff sum rows entry until desired trial completion level occurs..

Total amount spent before applying further percentual reduction would sum up to be= 15+7+8+6.4=$36.4 To apply the other % off, it means taking out another 20%, resulting into subtracting (.2*36.4)=$7.28 This result translates back to original price equivalent using percentage based representation hence adding both totals together results unto,$36.(no unit implied due restriction). Hence this amounts exactly same but slightly less than when applied sequentially since you don\u2019t receive full 20% reductions if multiple taken separately so just go directly calculate remaining $(total*(remaining \\space percantage))+$initial.$((36+(not\\_applicable\\times remainder)).
