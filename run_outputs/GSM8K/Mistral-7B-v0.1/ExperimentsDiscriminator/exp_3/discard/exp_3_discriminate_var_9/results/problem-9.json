        " out for shoplifting using information provided about this group relative to those refused to wear masks (four times as many) minus three additional individuals due to causing disturbances rather than engaging directly in any unlawful activities such as stealing or damaging store property (\"shoplifting\"). This means the calculation would look like `(3*4)-3`, which equates to `9`. Finally identify customer numbers associated specifically with occurrences involving acts beyond mere noncompliance regarding safety procedures; these instances involve aggressive behavior against merchandise availability/accessibility during checkout processes (`(9*3)`). Simplifying all our calculations provides us thus far with quantities corresponding to distinct action groups namely 'mask violators', 'individual contributing to retail larceny via violent confrontation','retail asset destruction incidents'. Summing up individual figures within our trio ('threats & intimidations') yields an aggregate figure representing collective entities who found themselves temporarily barred entry into said commercial establishment per respective cause category(`3+9+(9*3)=42`). Given totals exceed reported cumulative expulsions indicating extraneous entity categories exist outside initially identified ones('nonconformists'-shoppers whose conduct fell beneath accepted legal standards but weren\u2019t explicitly coded under previously enumerated motives), deducting known factors from overall count leaves numerical difference reflectively representative of omitted factor quantity hence providing desired solution.`Thus, subtract summed identifiable actions from grand numeral depicting complete set exclusion measures` (`65-(3+9+(9*3))`): Hereafter computes yield resultant amount insinuating existence plus participation rate quantified visually represented through graphical element herein termined subjunct.\" ",
        " out. Since it mentions 'four times that same amount as those who wore their masks', multiply three (those who refused) by 4 getting twelve. Subtracting one makes eleven kickouts due to shoplifting instead. Next identify individuals removed because of violent incidents related to good purchases; this equates into tripling the figures used so far which results to thirty-three. Adding up all these numbers leads us to forty seven (i.e., three [mask violation] plus eleven [shoplifting]) accounting for almost seventy percent of the total figure stated within question context \u2013 sixteen point eight percent less than overall removal quantity mentioned i.e. sixty five persons altogether indicates fifteen remaining being unaccounted or caused removals through separate means/reasons such potentially impromptu events etcetera happening inside store premises under observation but without any exact classification thereby making them categorically irrelevant hereunder discussed specific scenarios. Therefore accordingly excluding said miscellaneous cause detractors summing down actual documented causes yields negative ten (-10).

        " due to shoplifting (as it represents 'four times as many as those who didn\u2019t wear masks'). We also know three times the amount of people kicked out for shoplifting because this happened thrice, so another set of 9*(3) equals 27 individuals who experienced violent behavior during their shopping experience resulting in them getting removed from store premises. When all these figures are combined (3+9+27), you get 39 people accounting directly caused expulsion actions linked explicitly listed or identified earlier (mask noncompliance, stealing items). Since it said overall numbers add up to 65 across different categories including \u2018otherwise,\u2019 subtract the cumulative count of precisely known cases above from this figure which implies further unidentified causes led approximately to 65-39= 26 additional instances prompting removal; thus making us realize around twelve such discretely categorized incidents occurred outside our defined variables yet still culminated into extractions within Walt World environments owing potentially severe consequences attached/linked closely related eventualities occurring simultaneously concurrently but remain distinctively apart amidst primary enumerations mentioned prior.
