        " daily which equals 20 hours daily spent on all dogs combined. Since we want this amount over a period of one week (which consists of seven days), multiply those daily figures by seven. Hence, David dedicates about 20 hrs/day * 7 days/week= 140 hours per week walking or caring for these dogs. Therefore, according to your query asking him specifically 'how long it took them', if you mean time elapsed rather than cumulative efforts, since he could theoretically start work every morning while continuously working throughout any single day until Sunday midday before leaving town again etc., the most reasonable specific duration would likely vary based upon factors like breaks but presumably closer towards around half day(approximately 4-half day) might realistically fall within such variable context. But strictly speaking without considering other life events as specified only direct calculation indicates simply constant hour allocation translates directly onto whole weeks hence result being just simple multiplication no subtractions nor divisions needed further unless additional constraints provided otherwise regarding continuous availability vs intermittent engagement patterns potentially influencing overall totals due logistic practical considerations beyond mere numerical accountings alone thereby impacts exact durational outputs yield differances contoured thus implying comprehensive temporal analysis extends wellbeyond straightforward arithmetical simplifications solely reliant merely aggregation techniques under homogenous operating scenario assumptions excluding nuanced circumstance variations inherently affective timing distributions typically observed when executing routine occupational tasks routinely performed during standard shift cycles regardless holiday season adjustments generally nonetheless still adheres principal principles concerning fundamental principle groundwork underlying calculations described previously maintainable however caveats attached advisory cautionary approach warranted mindfulness ensuring accurate apprehension level alignment respective task performance scope limitations inclusions possibly amending quantified output expectancy accordingly reflect possible range alterations dependent situational peculiarities encompass potential modifications accommodative shifts may apply congruency aligned outcomes reaffirm core methodology whilst acknowledging adaptively responsive parameter integration necessitated consideration requisite attention vigilance exhibiting thorough analytic discernment aptitude capable facilitating prudent extrapolation accuracy assurers optimum utility derived judicious application precise instrument utilisation effectiveness maximization sustainibility promotion ultimately promoting professional excellence supreme achievement elevate standards benchmark aspire lofty ideals continually quest transcend ordinary limits inspiration foster innovation cultiv",
