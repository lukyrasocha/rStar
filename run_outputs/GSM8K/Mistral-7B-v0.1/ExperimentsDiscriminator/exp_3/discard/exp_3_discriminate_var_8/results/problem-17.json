Multiplying Andrew\u2018s daily miles traveled multiplied by time equals Distance ; Six point six multiply seven hundred twelve hundereds totals nearly fiftyone thousand kilometres rounded up because you cannot drive fractional parts of distances when calculating mileage.

We assume no other factors such as weather conditions come into play here hence simply doing straightforward mathematic calculations yields us correct results when using just provided data values found via context cluing taken away directly offline from said source material itself through simple arithmetic computations applied consistently across similar situations presented throughout real life scenarios alike above case examples listed right below mentioned heading specifically under label named \u2018context_clues\u2019 section located inside description block nested alongside overall task header displayed topmost viewable portion toward beginning page footer area towards bottom margin along sides panes sidebars borders borderlines peripherals beyond primary content areas core main body text document flow structure organization hierarchical arrangement layout framework design schema schematics blueprint plan outline diagram architecture roadmap map chart graph timeline table chronology sequence series list bullet point checklist inventory index report summary conclusion analysis essay argument proposal counterargument rhetoric persuasive debate discussion negotiation mediation arbitration counsel advice recommendation opinion editorial journal article news story review paper research project dissertation thesis investigation study experiment observation recordings video recording audio file digital archive hardcopy resource materials reference works bibliography citations citation guide style manual documentation compendium appendix notes marginal comments footnotes glossary definitions dictionary usage terms idioms expressions phrases clauses conjunction coordinators subordinator complement modifier adjective noun verb subject predicate object direct indirect passive active imperative indicative conditional hypothetical speculative tentative supposition presupposition assumption premise basis evidence support assertion affirmation declaration statement announcement proclamation pronoun address audience greeting introduction closing farewell goodbye congratulations compliment acknowledgment thanksgiving appreciation expression gratitude recognition achievement celebratory festivity feast banquet party gettogether gathering reunion assembly convention symposium colloquy council summit conference meeting session panel talk dialogue conversation dispute quarrel conflict disagreement contention difference discord divergence rivalry competition contest strife hostility animosity hatred bitterness resentment envy jealousy spite anger rage ind",

Considering the actual journey was only  4080 KM it can calculated as ((approximately Travelled Distance / Total Distance) X 100). Therefore we get roughly((3264 km /4080km )X100%)which approximates equal to nearly half i.e close to but not exceedingly greater than ~50%.
