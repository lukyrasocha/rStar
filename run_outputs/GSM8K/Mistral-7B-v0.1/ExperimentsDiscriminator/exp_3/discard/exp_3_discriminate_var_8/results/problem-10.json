Subtract these ones from overall count because we already know about them; therefore you\u2019ll get the remainder or unaccounted percentage equivalent i.e., whole \u2013 part=remainder(which would account for those favoring other colors). This implies subtracting thirty-two from sixty-four equalling thirty-two. That leaves us with another forty percent outliers whom seemingly don't share preference amongst any mentioned shades but might just simply adore Yellow according to our question requirement!

Hence, four times sixteen equals sixty-four i.e., thirty two pupils don\u2019t choose either colour but opt for yellow instead because it remains unclaimed among these seventy percenters or simply put, forty eight. Ultimately adding them up together shows twelve combined numbers favour both colours while half being equal makes another sum \u2013 eighteen twenty seconds representing other hues as well.
