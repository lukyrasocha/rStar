Therefore, James ran , or walked through the same area as far as possible when running upwards(walking only increases your cardiovascular health ) during these few hours because walking decreases it drastically. Thus every time you see someone jogging uphill make sure not to assume them as ill minded but realize their intentions behind doing such activities like strengthening themselves internally & building resistance against future diseases especially heart problems due physical exertion making us lazy bones!
