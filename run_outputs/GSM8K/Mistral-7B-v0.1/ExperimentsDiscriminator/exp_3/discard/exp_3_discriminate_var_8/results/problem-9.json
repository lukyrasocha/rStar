However if we assume fractional individuals could theoretically exist per scenario described but nevertheless apply round numbers here assuming maximum removal capability; thus calculating remaining group sizes becomes unnecessary since all members under examination already accountable/removed against said infraction categories culminating up totals surpasses known quantities available among human demographic parameters making accurate quantitative extrapolation beyond basic arithmetic impossible henceforth necessitating further clarification regarding specific conditions potentially influencing outcome distributions otherwise deemed excessively arbitrary considering standard mathematical applications typically employed towards solving comparably modest scale issues encountered during daily life affairs albeit acknowledging complexity introduced via introduction involving abstract concepts occasionally ventured into academic discourses yet seldom applied directly practicing ordinary problem resolution tactics generally favoured thereby excluding possibility existing exclusively theoretical propositions may manifest valid applicabilities absent empirical substantiation warranting verifiable validation prior incorporation within conventional decision making process frameworks accordingly stipulating essential additional guidelines facilitating definitive deduction upon precise determination correlating exactitude pertinent requisites fulfillment whilst navigating established procedural normatives adherent methodology employ practices conformative maintain alignment consonant principles governing systematic inquiry progression despite potential esoteric nature inherently associated ambiguous particularities presented engender complications possibly restricting immediate comprehensive assimilation therefore meriting detailed elucidation explicating foundational premises fostering enlighten understanding concerning specified circumstance dynamics empower subsequent analysis advancement optimizing relevancy scope appropriateness maximized precision consequential outputs ensuring informed judgement acquisition achieving goal aim ultimately satisfying objectives identified initiating respective dialogue collaboration generating mutually beneficial consensus reflector collaboratively developed best practice recommendations promoting overall efficiency improvement strategies align synergy shared goals progress collective welfare enhancements yield sustainable results fortifying institution robustness reinforce solidarity strength cooperate unity promote societal cohesion advocate peace accord harmony preserve environment safeguard rights protect",

Therefore no one was specifically mentioned as being removed only due to their violation related to 'other reasons', implying that those who weren\u2019t caught stealing or involved physically violent acts towards merchandise would presumably still remain inside without any punitive action taken against them under these categories specified. Given this scenario, it seems reasonable to conclude zero individuals faced disciplinary measures solely because they didn't adhere to certain store policies unrelated directly to illegal activities like theft (shoplifting) or assaulting property/others within said establishment premises pertaining here described ('physical violence'). This remains so unless additional context reveals such exceptions which unfortunately isn't available currently making assumptions otherwise potentially misleading.
