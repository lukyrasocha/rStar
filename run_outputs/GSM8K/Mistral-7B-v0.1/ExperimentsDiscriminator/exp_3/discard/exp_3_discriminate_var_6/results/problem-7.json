Keeping security standards high may require avoidance of these tools altogether. Certainly! Here is your requested solution written entirely within pure Python syntax designed with efficiency and simplicity in mind, ideal for environments constrained by stringent privacy controls. This method uses custom sorting algorithms such as Timsort (which Python internally optimizes but we mimic here), making direct comparisons among individual elements across all input lists directly. It also employs merging strategies similar to those used in lower implementations of timSort found in efficient sorting processes typically conducted externally before reaching this stage; thus ensuring optimal performance even when dealing with larger datasets. As per best practices suggested earlier, consider utilizing list comprehensions instead if possible due their conciseness over traditional 'for loop'. Note though that readability often takes precedence ahead of minor gains achieved through compact coding styles \u2013 prioritizing cleanliness helps prevent mistakes too easily made amidst complex expressions especially crucial under time sensitive circumstances common during HackerRank challenges & interviews alike hence justifying preferring straightforward approach whenever feasible although both approaches mentioned below demonstrate equivalent functionality maintainable ease via descriptive comments/keywords : `merge_and_reverse_sort` version explicitly details steps taken , enhancing clarity further ; however remember higher priority remains towards execution speed particularly vital against benchmark tests encountered regularly amongst competitive technical examinations so feel free adapt according fit situation specific requires either strategy accordingly adjustments could necessary based upon scenario evaluation .

Finally subtracting what Jesse obtained from what Linda managed leads us into concluding Jesse indeed gets significantly higher calorie intake having consumed around about   3128(Cal)_jess - 1036 (Cal_lisa) = <<3128-1036=2092>>2092 additional Calories when compared with Lisa .

Analyze considering potential trade-offs regarding model complexity versus computational efficiency while maintaining predictive power under scenarios characterizing sudden economic downturns not captured within prior historical records.
