That means if you take the value assigned to video sessions which was established earlier as X=2 hour; Reading would therefore account for X/2 hence Y=X/2 or Y=2/2 hrs resulting into zero since both activities occur simultaneously thus no difference needs considering when calculating results based around single events occurrences over specific periods like 'two instances'.

        " much time Paul spent reading during those same 2 weeks. He also read once (or went through one cycle) which took him another couple of hours making it equal to reading 1*2=2 hours over these 2 iterations . Combine both activities taking place together within individual periods i.e., add them up ,that makes it equals(tv+reading)=4+2=6 Hence we take into account only 2 cycles since he repeats all this activity twice a week or thrice overall. Repeat the entire process described above but instead multiply everything by three because eventually our goal period here is across full thirty plus even numbers namely  3 sets of 25weeks therefore getting us back to tv hrs:(total hours)/week*(number_of__sets)^wks=(4*3^3)*days_per_cycle wk=>((4hours/week)(cw))^(monthly)-> ((4*(third set)))+(3x6),so adding first four months results :(first_four)+second group including their respective weights -> month ",
        " spent watching TV (which was 1 hour), calculate it over both instances; since these activities occur once in pairs across four sets of two episodes within the seven daily cycle period... i.e., [Reading / Watching] ----> {[Walk | Walk], [Run | Run]} => {\"Watch\"=[[W|R]] -> W+R}. It makes sense because if you walked one way & ran back home--you could either run another distance during your return trip OR engage immediately afterwards in relaxation or other light exercise.. We use readings instead of runs here justified using logical connectives 'and,' meaning any instance when we walk AND run constitutes only ONE unit counted towards our weekly quota regardless its composition made up outta multiple walks followed distantly spaced throughout various parts o\u2019hours\u2014the same goes wi \u2018reading.\u2019 This logic extends further through application processes involving similar conditions expressed via boolean algebra operations like intersection (`&`) taking place alongside exclusive disjunction operation `!==`(as used above). Thus concluded thus far\u2026 To find what % increase percentage comes next considering prior baselines set aside initially before proceeding forward into analyzis stages....

        " he watches 2 hours, if we take away one hour (half), it means he reads for another hour per session. That totals to 2+1=3 hours every time when combining both activities together since mentioned twice a week so it would be doubled which becomes equal to  3*2=6 hours spent doing either activity once per sitting or over all seven nights excluding snacks etc..So considering everything put into context including frequency i.e., happening twice a week...It implies multiplication with respect to period i.e 7x6=>42 hrs but multiplied again wrt Period defined here ie 'week', hence overall required value equates up to Total Hours Spent : ((HRS SAT ONLY) WEEKS PER SESSION)*SESSINES/WEEK*(HOURS SPENT IN EACH SERIES OF ATTEMPTS) , respectively .

        " 2 = 1 hour. Each time he does both activities together it takes him 2 (TV) + 1 (reading) = 3 hours. This routine happens twice per week so over one full week he invests 3 \u00d7 2 = <<3*2=6>>6 hours into these hobbies combined. Over twenty-five whole weeks he would therefore invest just 6 \u00d7 25 = 150. Thus the answer is : 150; which means within those specific conditions, if applied continuously during regular nonstop cycles throughout every single month all through several months without fail, such habits could result collectively culminating upwardly towards approximately sixty cumulative personified instances or periods underpinned specifically revolving around individuality attributed directly unto personal engagements exhibiting unique behaviors typifying human conduct manifesting primarily orientated toward sublimely facilitating overall welfare thereby promoting holistic wellbeing hence enhancing subjective sense gratifications derived solely dependent upon selfish desires coupled additionallily augmentatively supplemented subsequently furthermore contributing positiveterrestriquessubstantialytooverallimprovedwellfarethroughindividualizedpersonalconcernsrepresentativemultidimensionalnaturetowardsenhancementofcompletepsychosocialintegrationfacilitatedviaintrinsicallymotivationalpropensitiesforexpansioninthecontextwhentimeunderconsiderationwiththespecificconditionsofsustainingcontinuousselfdirectedactivismcharacteristicallyoriententedtworightdirectionalitysimulatortogetherconcurrentlyasoneunitywhereforeaccelerativeimpactaccumulationculmatiserthroughsystemicinterconnectednessfosteringcollaborativeconstructivenesstherebymodelizationoftransformativetranscorporativeadaptabilitiesandresilienceprinciplepedagogicalpreceptualineamentsexemplifyingdynamiccooperationuniversalsynergosystemethicscapabilitiesleadingtowardanecdotalempiricalrealizabilitysynthesevaluatableevidencebasedpositiveoutcomesaffirmativelylinkedstrategicamenteffunctionaleffectivityeffectivelivedailylifefabrictransmittingvaluesreflectiverelationshipapproachescommunicatoncorecompulsorycomponentsnecessaryunconditionalacceptancedecenthumaneequalitydemocrat",
        " every evening doing both activities combined \u2013 this equals 2 (for TV) plus another one (reading), thus making it 3 hours per session. As mentioned earlier, these sessions occur twice a week. Thus over any span of four weeks (which sums up to about 4*2=8 evenings considering those exact terms above). It means he completes eight such episodes across twenty-five seven-week blocks within which would make around sixteen occurrences (((25/4)*8)=<<(25/4)*8=64>>64 instances.) Each instance lasting him three hours makes a cumulative amount; therefore,(64 times)(each episode takes place thrice daily))+(3*(number of individual events)). Hence you find out, (64times)(3)+=(192+x)), hence adding all together provides us with exactly  192 additional minutes beyond what our initial calculation offered because we considered only whole cycles without taking breaks into account.(((total seconds taken throughout entire set divided by secs present during complete cycle)-secs consumed outside normal operations)); meaning overall consumption averages [(Total Consumption)/[Sum Of Entire Cycles]] i.e., [{(Time spent while active)}+(Number of non standard intervals)]/(Cycles Present Over Set Span).
