Therefore if initially meant collectively took twelve times slower than working independently which means having quadruple duration like mentioned above taking threefold increase makes sense too making these groups last eighty additional mins hence summing up to thirty minutes less overall compared against what occurred without division within teams.(Time reduction calculation) Tortoises are walking faster than usual due mainly being driven harder physically when forced out onto open spaces insteadof just scurrying along beneath foliage edges or burrow entrances etc., however here despite constant acceleration efforts nothing seems changed unless stated otherwise suggesting slowdown factors include heavy vehicle traffic conditions interfering negatively affecting performance output thus preventing any significant progress made during crossing period until reached finish line once again leaving both patience & persistence needed towards completion objectives..
