To find out what Steven paid, multiply the quantity of items sold by their price; hence multiplying 8 (total pairs purchased) by $56 (price). This results into 8*56=$448 altogether or when divided among the four types ($112 for boys\u2019 shoe sets & $112 for girls\u2019 one set respectively.) Thus,$448 as whole/inclusive expenditure was spent not necessarily split equally among different categories if we follow this strict interpretation based solely on provided details without implied assumptions regarding uniform allocation across varied product groups under consideration here.

Solving such problems doesn\u2018t require knowledge outside basic arithmetic; however , its key feature lies within applying correct approach and avoiding common mistakes .

        " per child (each pair consists of 2 shoe). This totals to 4*2=<<4*2=8>>8 individual shoes purchased across both kids. Each set costs $56 so we multiply this amount by their count; thus you calculate as follows : 56*$56^num_sets=$result . Here , num_sets equals eight hence result yields 56*$8 or simply $, <<56*8=448>>448. To conclude Stephen paid steeply $\\boxed{448}$. Let\u2019s break down our procedure again just to double check calculations.

Therefore, if one kid spends 56 dollars; together the boys spend 56 \u00d7 2=<<56*2=112>>112 dollarsto buy these 4 pairs of shoes each . Hence stevenspent 112 times or <<112*1=112>>112dollarsfor them. The answer is: 112. ",
        " he bought 4 * 2 = 8 pairs altogether. And since one pair costs $56, eight would indeed require him spend a sum of $56*8=448$.
