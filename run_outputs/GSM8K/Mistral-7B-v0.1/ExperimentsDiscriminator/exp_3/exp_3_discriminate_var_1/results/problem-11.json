One last thing though I would say its not right because even considering fractions nobody goes into google building unless employed therefore leaving aside any fractional persons count leaves me confused but still here lies my estimate :Above estimation doesn't take into consideration unoccupied vehicles like perhaps fuel tanker drivers who may also accompany us thus limiting our available passenger space considerably meaning lower than seventy thousand person estimated capability!
