Thus, seventy one birds remain while considering all conditions described earlierly stated within the question asked .",
        " tells us this was half (1/2) of the original amount which equates to 94 / 2 = 47 birds. Subtracting these 47 frightened birds leaves you with the remaining intact population of birds; hence,  94 \u2013 47 equals 47 unperturbed avian lives existing amidst nature\u2019s sanctuary within our domestic confines.

According to question statement;  24 extra buddies join those who weren\u2019t spooked initially , so simply add up your previous calculations made as follows ;   47+24=.

Finally count other aviary creatures joining this group. Other species identified as having come into town include flock numbers stated which equals to 24 additional individuals or groups presenting themselves amidst our still flying friends. Add those figures together i.e., adding up previously found remainder plus newly arriving populations resultant equation becomes like so; Hence Final Bird Tally Amid Danger = Result Of Previous Stage Population Plus New Arrival Number Equals To Given Sum As Stated Which Is Like This Formula Below When Plugging Numbers Back Up With Original Problem Statement We Get Initial Unsafe Species Count Minus Those Who Were Terrified By Stone Throw Lessened Avian Migration Figures More Recently Joined Existing Fliers At Home Culminate Mathematically Yield Desired Quantity Or "
