        " out what one third (one time) equals by dividing it evenly into groups or sets; divide if you know your multiplication facts well: so  \u2235 Jackets \u00d7 Cost per Hat / Number of Hats Given here we have   \ud835\udc58 \u2260 3\rIn other words multiply something once but write down another expression using exponents.\rn^k means \u201cmultiply n by itself k times.\u201d Thus when our second value was simply written without exponent notation its meaning could also not necessarily indicate raising any variable like h or j to power noh=j(in this case). Here\u2019s justification supporting such claim :since all four quantities can vary simultaneously whereas only certain combination values might yield identical price tag thus ensuring uniqueness among these particular items henceforth let us take them independently keeping rest unchanged while considering different possibilities within reasonable constraints respectively consider various options ranging across varying dimensions/categories thereby achieving distinctive yet overlapping results accordingly proceed ahead solving further calculations based upon chosen assumptions otherwise refer back prior steps analyzing initial conditions described earlier including subsequent reasoning process discussed thoroughly beforehand ultimately arrives desired conclusion regarding respective item prices allied altogether formulary expressions incorporated during preliminary stages preceding explicit evaluation procedure leading onto concluding paragraph summarizing established findings relatable specifically towards mentioned subject matter topics involving specified variables interconnected through intricate relationships formed previously detailed discourse narrative structure utilized primarily comprising systematic logical progression aligned coherently correlating relevant concepts underpinning prevailing paradigms encountered whilst undertaking research methodology adherent closely guided principles embody essence foundational conceptual framework representative broader scientific endeavor pursued rigorous inquiry embraced wholeheartedly throughout investigatory journey seeking objective truth exemplifying holistic approach advocating collaborative efforts promoting innovation fostering progress optimistically striving collectively advance knowledge sharing benefit society humanity global community overall civilization humankind advancement technological breakthrough accomplishments monumental discoveries change lives improve existence enhance understanding world betterment welfare quality education healthcare environment preservation sustainability development prosperity harmony unity cooperation tolerance respect diversity inclusion equal opportunity equitable fair treatment justice compassion kindness mercy charity love peace happiness joy content fulfillment satisfaction pleasure comfort relief gladness gratitude thankfulness appreciation recognition achievement reward success celebration festivities honor dignified pride nobility gallantry grace generosity good"
