Subtract these unsellable volumes from the original purchase volume to get the quantities eligible for refund; so, subtracting those approximately 342gallons results into roughly 2052 - 342 = 1710 gallons qualifying for a refund. Determine the monetary value equivalent to returning said qualified units back to preventance against loss or waste through consumption beyond their effective period using the unit sale price previously calculated ($4/glass); hence calculating costs equal returns equate multiplying the refundable goods count identified earlier (approximately 1710 glasses), by sales unit rate indicating every glass accounted within our context here amounts upwards towards forty four cents ((approx.) .8*$4=3.2 but since any fraction off would mean partial reimbursement won't apply here roundup thus leading us to use approx. whole numbers rather than decimal point values such fractions wouldn't make practical sense realistically speaking considering actual transactional processes tend too work around conventional counting system based entirely upon integer figures).

Given no specific instructions about approximation levels allowable but assuming standard rounding rules apply.

As you correctly pointed out initially before considering any form of estimation, our exact value remains crucial when calculating financial transactions like a refund.

Thus the return made would reflect based upon original price paid rather than any possible future gainings through sale hence resulting value being calculated simply using multiplication. Total Return Amount -> Price Per Gallon ($4) X Quantity Spent Damages (Gallons Expired); so; thus Refund Value -> $4*342 = $<<4*342=1368>>1368 . Hence Mr. Donald gets $1368 in refunds!
