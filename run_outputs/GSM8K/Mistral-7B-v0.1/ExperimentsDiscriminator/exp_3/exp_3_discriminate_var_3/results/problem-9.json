Well well yes obviously numbers definitely mean stuff eventually although usually meaningless unless someone asks specifically otherwise ;-) Anyways back up instead:-first thing note while doing calculations always remember order operands inside braces correctly eg -(ab^c)=-(abc),=(aa)bbccdd=((abb)(ccc))d=>(ac)^bd=(acde)(bcdf)). Therefore you may want check yourself easily thus checking whether brackets exist around every product formed via multiplication operations such (-)-(*/-+~<></>,{})+(|||)[]. Next time try writing clear expressions using proper symbols whenever necessary; consider simplifying terms involving exponents etc., avoid redundant parentheses wherever possible--also pay attention towards correctness within grouping rules namely associative laws applied appropriately throughout entire expression:(xy)/yz!=x/(yz),(ax)/(az)=((xa)/az),etc.-note however unlike addition division remainders carry into subsequent ones thereby leaving unneeded results upon removal . Finally ,always verify intermediate answers against expectations rather than blindly trust your own calculations due various common mistakes causing errors typically encountered during mathematics homework sessions hence ensuring accuracy level high despite occasional hiccups occurrings along way.* However based entirely merely purely arithmetic computations required no prior assumptions beyond previously stated initial conditions listed below :-the previous result calculated yields following simplified form ::total_people==sum_(i->num_of_)customers[(five*)factorialminusfour)]+[three*negative(?one())]*zero)*six]++nine)..which apparently appears strange ??.so",
