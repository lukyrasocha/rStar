To find out how different their food intake was, you need first calculate respective numbers multiplied by one parameter -- namely 'calorie per unit', here being `per cup`.

We know every mug contains roughly approximately ---~G grams...thus we multiply accordingly....that leaves us our resulting figure..which could either remain within bounds or get adjusted appropriately based upon contextual requisites ! This helps simplify matters down even further once basic arithmetic involving fractions becomes necessary , but ultimately ensures clarity around any potential rounding discrepancies during conversions especially if certain substances exhibit minor chemical variations relative dimensions compared against established references points used previously ... Furthermore these modifications might prove advantageous since calculations tend differ slightly depending entirely whether specific units such quantities involved; therefore relying solely off conventional definitions risks introducing biases towards particular measurement systems instead focusing objectivity across disciplines all aim toward achieving same results regardless personal preferences ....

        " Sarah also ate 3 * 6 = 18 cookies this time around. Therefore together over both days, Sarah consumed 27 (from mon) + 18(Tue)=45 cookies while Dorothy consumes only  9+6=15 cookies during those same periods which results into fewer food intake overall . Each cookie was made up of 51 Calories therefore, we find out Sarah consumer ed ((27+18)*51)-[(9+6)*51]=((45*51))-(15*51) or further breaking it down ,we can solve using algebra thus finding differences; [(x)+[y]]=(z). Herein z would represent amount of extra consumption whereas y represents what difference needs evaluating ; hence solving via algebraic expression becomes easier : [(.5)(45)]=[(-.)][(15)(51)). Finally substituting numerical values accordingly yields result equalling (=), i.e., [(-.0]={extra}[Calories]. Extra means taking additional sum subtracting regular daily amounts/consumption.; To put things simpler yet again one might go directly calculating respective sums respectively first so forth their subtractions yield answers finally equalizing them accordingly but doing mathematical operations aloud requires skillfulness nonetheless making use of appropriate expressions proves efficient saving precious moments allotted for calculations especially when dealing large datasets such used hereabove encompasses multiple iterations etc..

        " it was 27; on Tuesday, it was 18. Total for both days is 27 + 18 = 45 cookies. These extra cookies amounted to (45 \u2013 9) / 2 because half of them came from Dorothy. This calculation yields ((45 \u2212 9) / 2) or 18 additional cookes consumed by Sarh due to doubling up what Dorothy ingested over these two days . Each one contains about 51 calories so our equation reads out to find Calorie difference we can compute via (51*18)=918 calorie differential achieved through this approach.

Similarly, find out the amount of calories consumption during Tuesday too which was when dorothy eat six so sara would consumes it three time i.e.,  6x 3 =<<6*3=18>>18 , thus this meals contained only calories 18 X 51 = <<18*51=918>>918 .

        " 3 = 18 cookies. Overall, Sarah consumed (27+18) = 45 cookies. Calculate the difference in their consumption over both days since it requires multiplication because this involves comparing multiple quantities rather than just one individual value or comparison. To calculate how many more calories Sarah consumed than Dorothy across both days combined based on multiplying factors related to different units such as quantity of food items per unit weight/volume), we need detailed information about these relationships \u2013 which isn\u2019t provided herein directly but would require conversion formulas considering daily average intake calculations possibly involving additional numerical data points not specified within the problem statement itself.)
