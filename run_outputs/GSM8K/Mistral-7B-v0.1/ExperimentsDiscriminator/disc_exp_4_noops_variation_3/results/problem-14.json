This implies that both sets\u2014the fastest set among animals taking lesser duration versus slowers ones who took longer durations can also exist simultaneously because even if you count differently here when calculating such proportions; however using these methods allows comparison easier especially against our target species 'turtles.'

Given these circumstances occur simultaneously instead individually, hence only involving factorial adjustments rather than linear ones which leads us directly to multiplicative reasoning .

Hence we can deduce approximately every individual kiarao covers ~6hrs/work unit or simply say moves roughly towards their goal~every hour i.e., moving .6*km/hr pace.(Alternatively One could calculate rate=total_time*speed using original data provided too.)

This effectively slows down our calculation making them cover just \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) distance in any timeframe normally taken for full coverage. Because if we consider all movement times inclusive of breaks equal work time (in terms of progress), such pauses essentially multiply effective working seconds/hours needed by a factor of \\(\\frac{4}{3}\\).

Finally let us calculate how long all those lazy little reptiles might spend taking breaks while hopping over said roads..

To find out how many trips together require time we first consider them working simultaneously like before; three kangaroos doing one journey would complete instantly compared against solo efforts by individual slower species. Therefore combining our calculations leads us back only needing just over doubled amounts since both sets work concurrently rather than separately \u2013 yielding approximately eightfold increase without precise synchronization affecting actual timing which may vary slightly depending upon whether or not coordinated starts occur during breaks/recesses occurring throughout these lengthened sessions due possibly also affected indirect aspects caused through interaction amongst differing lifeforms impacting overall rate differently among varied creature types when engaged within mixed assemblies especially regarding activities involving complex cooperative behaviors potentially leading subtly alterations via factors other directly quantitative measurable metrics influencing progress rates etc..

However we also know these don\u2019t work continuously but rather intermittently \u2013 stopping regularly (underneath \u2018shady trees') . While the exact rate or duration of their breaks isn't provided, such frequent disturbances could potentially add significant extra travelling time not accounted explicitly within any formulaic approach based purely off initial speeds. Therefore, while theoretically you might calculate '4 turtles equal 12*(1/4)', due to lack of specific timings about pauses or possible slower overall movement rates caused by said pauses; realistically predictive calculations become complex beyond just simple arithmetic multiplication involving factors like average slowdown during periods spent beneath shelter etc., hence no precise numerical calculation can conclusively establish this situation here solely using fundamental principles regarding relative velocities yet factoring all associated impact elements simultaneously causing potential considerable increase over initially expected projections rendering quantification impractical absent further detailed procedural data defining parameters surrounding halt durations plus additional influencing conditions tied directly affecting individual unit motion capabilities inherent specifically unique amongst various chosen participants i.e differenced performance variances occurring amidst subjects involved thereby demanding holistic methodological approaches incorporating comprehensive information gathering encompassing subject behavioural nuances whilst operating under different environmental influences inducing resultant variation levels among specified test cohort members dictated accordingly through respective circumstance influenced performances observed subsequently forming necessary inputs required allowing subsequent relevant computation undertakings towards eventual objective completion thus illustratively demonstrating requisite complexity necessitating extended inquiry methods deployed alongside considered observational studies conducted aimed strictly producing pertinent observations yielding consequential reliable results applicable accurately reflecting accurate scenario representation depictions inclusive entirety maintaining true respect accuracy integrity representing original problem intended purpose fulfillment ensuring solution outcome satisfaction compliancy satisfying corresponding task requirements ultimately benefitting future application usefulness enhancements facilitating target outcomes achievement optimizing maximum utility gain resulting most effectively promoting anticipated desired goals accomplishments seamlessly navigated satisfactorily throughout complete investigative process execution sequentially progressing efficiently achieving set objectives successfully guaranteeably deliverables provision confirmed unalterable post examination phase culmination verifying absolute preciseness preservation uph",

This implies if all three traveled individually without overlap (a hypothetical scenario), their combined effort leads them through this journey in the specified amount of time due to working concurrently rather than consecutively.
