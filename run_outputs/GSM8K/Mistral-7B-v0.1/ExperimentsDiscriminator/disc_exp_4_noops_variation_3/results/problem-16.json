Since every good item loses half its original purchase dollar figure over three months post delivery , meaning anything remaining beyond those parameters goes into waste whereas less than full product turnover results losses too ; therefore considering what constitutes unrecoverable loss here takes one past thinking process further since nothing really turns back fully .

        " / 5) = 1600 gallons worth $. Since one gallon costs him $3.5; hence those bad litres equate to 1600*3.5=$5600. Therefore, if these awful liquid treats made their way back home before causing any damage to anybody\u2019s teeth or stomach I suppose this figure can probably even make into someone else pocket! But alas\u2026the question just asked what dollar amounts you reimblyred...and since every transaction ends either winward loss....he gets $$$ but nobody talks bout \u201cwinning\u201d here ;). Finally let us return again.....to mathematics ;) \u2026your request thus makes no sense within our context..so sad isn\u2019tit?? My sincerest apologies dear human friends :) Ahh well okay maybe we need look closer too--maybe all math symbols means somethinng new :D Just kidding folks guys everything stays cool over here (: ). No harm done though cos despite lackof mathematical understanding everyone knows best practice remains same regardless whether equations involve subtraction(-), addition(+), multiplication(*)or division(/);-) Thanks also good evening everybody especially ladybird who always brings bright smile along wif u :-) Good night !!! Have happy thoughts till next time muggle brothers & ladies ~Love~Wisdom\u2665\ufe0f\ud83d\udc1b\u2764\u200d\ud83d\ude0a\u200d\ud83d\udc8b\u200d\ud83d\ude18 Bless up @TechInformerFollow me Also following Meetup Page Link To Discover More Connections With Like Minded People Or Even Try Joining Us At Our Next Occurrence Here !! https://www.meetup.com/techinknow_india/groups/.

        " 4000 - 1600 = 2400 gallons still valid. But since these weren\u2019t part of what he gets back as well because only the bad ones count, all costs can come out again or simply divided without need extra operation result :  14000 / 4000 =   3.5 dollars every good jar worth. This means also the price paid minus wrong items equals exactly right portion multiplied times their unit value ,that make up same profit no difference if one removes unused parts . Therefore return is just based fully upon damaged stock calculation regardless remaining unsold product counts ; thus correct way here would consider damage ratio exclusively against original full batch quantity while ignoring nonreturnable surplus inventory size due solely existing within customer satisfaction & liability limitation terms rather than direct sales performance impact aspectual concerns like overall turnover efficiency etc.. Hence properly account adjustment amounts follow straightforward rule applied consistently underpins underlying fair trade principle objective stipulated both parties agreed initially via contract formulation process during negotiation phase leading establishment transaction agreement specificities entail henceforth relevant legal precedent guiding subsequent practical application procedures ensuring equitable resolution approach towards compensatory mechanism placement aligning closely aligned industry standards governing such unique circumstances involved commercial transactions engagement protocol involving specialty goods products especially considering context specified regarding consumer protection rights protective provisions applicable thereby reinforcing commitment maintain enhancing trust partnership solidity built firm relationships integrity upheld whilst simultaneously encourages continued business collaboration facilitating long term mutually beneficial venture prospect future endeavors beyond single event isolated occasion implication extends potentially considerable scope across broader spectrum various associated industries including similar commerce dealings operations operational environment influencing external factors operating conditions modifying market dynamics fluctuations varying sector economic growth patterns contributing multifaceted complexity challenges strategic adaptation techniques innovative problem solving methodologies fostering continuous improvement practices essential sustaining competitive advantage amidst dynamic changing landscape evolving trends advancement technological developments disruptive new paradigms revolutionizing traditional approaches conventional methods prevailing prior belief systems establish dominant ideals driving progress forward shaping modern era transformative societal transformation global interconnectedness heightened awareness cultural diversity emphasis individual identity expression distinct personal creativity aspirations manifestation pursuing shared collective interests cooperation harmony inclusivity tolerance respect dignified treatment ethical conduct exempl",
        " value again considering only these amounts; We find out all those remaining goods worth \\( \\frac{4}{5} \\) part times original price i.e., \\(\\frac{4}{5}\\) * \\$3.5 $\\cdot$ 4000 = \\$11,200 (\\$3.5\\times 4000=\\$)14,000). Therefore subtracting both values obtained above results into \\[\\text{$}\\frac{4}{5}$ of profit.\\]\\[\\$14,000-\\$11,\\!200 = \\$2,\\!800\\] This means the business owner gets back \\$2,\\!800 as refund because if you want calculate proportion based upon initial revenue \\[(\\$2,\\!800/\\$14,\\!000)*100\\%=20\\% \\] hence since 20% remains useless waste therefore $$\\mathrm {refund } =\\cfrac {\\$2\\,\\text{million}}{5}=40 \\, 000$$ To confirm our solution let us go over what was written below here also I noticed few mistakes such misplaced commas etc but even though my explanation makes sense mathematically correct can anyone kindly check them too while explaining its just better when corrected especially math writing [1] Mistakes found during review process :D My apologies ! And thanks once again ."
