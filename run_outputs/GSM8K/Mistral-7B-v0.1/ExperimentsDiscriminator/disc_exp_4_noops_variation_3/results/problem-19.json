To find out how much longer the time needed we need subtracting times spent applying the same coating on both types of paints (i.e., original_time \u2013 replacement_coating). Therefore, extra hours spend means addition up numbers which resulted when calculating these amounts individually (extra_hours=original_varnishing\u2013replacement_varinashionning) This amount equals 72 \u2212 42 therefore additional required time is equal to twelve twenty minute blocks because if every block represents twice thirty seconds than full twelves become fourteen forty second intervals (additional_required_hours==extra_hours*twenty).
