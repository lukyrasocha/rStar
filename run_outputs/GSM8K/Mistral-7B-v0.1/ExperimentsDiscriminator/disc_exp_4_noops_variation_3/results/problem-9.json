Assuming these represent all known individuals, calculate twice their count since thirty percent fall under physically violent behavior categories but no direct numbers can yield absolute certainty. Given ten scenarios per category based upon multiples of thrice/twice values or directly proportionate figures leading to fifty divided amongst respective groups yields approximately six persons assigned towards non-identified violations assuming equal division among unspecified infractions alongside previously accountable factors like failing compliance ('wear') instructions.
