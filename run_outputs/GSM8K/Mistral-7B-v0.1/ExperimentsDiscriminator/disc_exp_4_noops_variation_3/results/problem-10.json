We already calculated earlier the amount when considering everyone except those that preferred Blue initially leaving us exactly these same fifteen individuals showing preference towards 'Yellow.'

What a vibrant burst of joyful energy such bright hues could bring into this beautiful little world right here amongst your favorite people!! Keep spreadin\u00b4 positivity ya folks!!! :D Hope you enjoyed reading my creative thoughts over math problems involving primary school children ;) I wish everyone within these stories was real because together let's strive towards making our lives better always remember life starts when you believe !
