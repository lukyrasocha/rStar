As we cannot actually purchase fractions of containers or change prices due to demand fluctuations, Cynthia ends up purchasing exactly 3 whole new boxes, hence spending precisely  6 USD overall on Icecreams through these 35 days while having enough supplies until all other cartons get finished outstandingly soon as no additional stocks could possibly exist within those specific timescale restrictions stated.

With this information, figure out if we need any full cartons or not based off their size (the problem tells us these values right here--there being able to purchase half amounts don't seem necessary considering our time frame.) You may use math operations like division because you want only whole numbers as answers without partial elements; otherwise known as \u201cfractional\u201d ones . Here goes : Divide into your target count= divide(35 ,14) That results equaling exactly 2 which indicates she needs no less than double quantity but neither fraction nor remainder exist when doing such divisions \u2013 essentially showing its sufficient having just what was initially required!
