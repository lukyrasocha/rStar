Two fourths or half prefer this colour as well since one third dislikes it just three times over four; thus only one quarter prefers another hue such as red because all others either love indigo & violet but not cyan! Red would come next before orange once again due its popularity among us too often enough already... And finally pink--our favorite shade actually comes first during these comparisons if you ask me though I still enjoy comparing those colors together :) Oh dear friends please take note my bad formatting may seem quite confusing although everything makes perfect sense when read carefully ;) Anyway hope everyone enjoyed reading despite lackluster writing styles:( My apologies yet here goes nothing else can follow suit until someone upgrades our forum software :(.
