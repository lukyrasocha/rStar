We know all variables except P which represents what percentage audrey wants..so plugging into our equation looks like...((P*(40)+(-1)^20*q(Q)))/( Q+(N)-Q)..since every question counts toward scoring no matter if wrong or not N still equals T when calculating desired score since only good answers count as scored anyways .

To find out how many questions make up one percent we can divide 70 by 7 so it becomes easier; thus, every question makes up roughly about 1%. Since 42 answers represent around 60%, this implies she still hasn\u2019t completed the required percentage yet since the minimum requirement is already over halfway through only counting what was necessary pertaining to passing both tests. This indicates if audrey wants exactly 70% overall instead assuming equal value/importance across all subjects regardless their content or difficulty like Math vs History etc., lets call these X & Y as fractions representing parts taken care off respectively via those individual tasks within general studying routine process including revision timings allocated while considering performance level variance taking place during evaluation exercises conducted throughout semester period duration involving multiple cumulative student participation activities occurring concurrently simultaneously enabling collective knowledge sharing opportunities potentially improving group collaboration skills fostering healthy academic environment supportively facilitating peer discussion sessions organized bi-weekly resulting into mutually beneficial learning experiences hence allowing students learn independently however ultimately yield significant growth potential amongst peers thereby achieving successful graduation rates leading towards promising future career prospects provided effective mentorship guidance accompanied alongside comprehensive curriculum structured systematically tailored specifically customized designed purposefully strategically developed aimed exclusively focused primarily upon nurturing positive educational atmosphere conducive optimizing fullest utilization maximizing best possible utility whilst encouraging personal development mindset cultivated among individuals herein therefore educators play crucial instrumental role assisting teachers guide effectively guiding instructors motivate stimulate curiosity inspire enthusiasm engender interest encourage exploration creativity spark innovative thinking problem solving critical reasoning analytical approaches examination techniques enhancement self evaluations improvement methodologies progress assessment standards accountability responsibility discipline integrity ethics respect professionalism teamwork cooperation social interaction leadership qualities communication essential interpersonal relationships relationship building networks connections community partnerships networking collaborations cross functional teams multidisciplinary groups research projects science experiments laboratory experiment data analysis charts graphs tables spreadsheets software programs databases applications programming languages script coding frameworks web design graphics editing tools illustration imagery multimedia integration digital archiving preservation digitized storage systems cloud computing servers public key infrastructures certificates authorizations encryption decryption verification protocol security policy comp",

First figure out which fraction it takes away or adds back so audree could hit (a) seventy percent across all answers(b). Since six tens are twenty ones half thirty would leave eighteen hundred fifty divided evenly into one sixty four ninety ten.(c). From part b subtract three forty eight seven zero parts leaving eleven twenty two percentage points; therefore if Audrey answered only fifteen perfect on the next portion those same twelve questions made needed plus whatever was above full marks make hers over whole numbers again enough because its easy just use subtraction adding everything minus twos nines fives times .
