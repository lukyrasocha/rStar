        " problem also says it takes three hats (three times the price) so multiply out 25 multiplied by 3 which equals 75. It was mentioned that the pants take the avg(hattotal+jackettotal), meaning find both item totals plus divide all prices through half; therefore calculate like this ((25+75)/2)=50 . Finally add them together ; thus, adding up those amounts gets you your unit expense , hence  25+75+50=the same thing because when we sum them it results into  150.. Therefore every uniform needs $$$$$ signifying hundred dollar units.......so I deduce our single result : .........which shows us if one asks about what would amount be necessary pertaining individually ordered items altogether without any kind or form disguise ..we can conclude its value being equivalent only but rather different than other numerical representations such cents places etc ...it simply means everything considered fully included within budget range still keeps overall figures balanced against previous spending plans while respectfully honoring financial responsibility guidelines applicable throughout society generally speaking ;) ..! Let me know however whether u want simplified version since these words look somewhat unnecessarily verbose & elaborate especially towards younger demographic/ audience who might struggle grasp concept quickly due language barriers / lack knowledge relating certain cultural context factors involved particularly concerning topic under analysis herein discussed above!!

        " dollars. To find out how much the pants cost (which equals the average cost), we first add up the price of the jacket ($75) and the hat ($25). That would make a sum of $100. We divide this value by 2 to obtain the averaged amount i.e., $100/2=50$. Therefore, one pair of pants costs $50. Adding all these amounts together ($25+$75+$50=$150$), we can say the single unit or entire set including its delivery case which might vary depending upon several environmental factors like transportation distance etc. It\u2019d still result close to our main calculation regardless those variations. Hence, 'approximately', each complete bundle approximately costs about $150.

This yields us $75 (because $25 multiplied by 3 equals $75). Determine if we know directly or not what the combined cost of the coat and hat would amount to since this information wasn't explicitly provided; however, considering our earlier calculations show individual prices, deduce together both these elements form the 'hat+jacket'. Therefore add them up which results into getting their collective sum \u2013 i.e., adding together $25 (the value associated with the \u2018hat part') plus another equivalent amount represented by '$75', accumulating sums worth exactly $100 altogether. Recognizing one further component referenced within your explanation being referred towards\u2014\u2018pants,\u2019 remember these came about due to averages taken across only those items stated previously ('hat+'plus'+jacket=total').
