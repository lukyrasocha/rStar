With the new varnish which requires 12 minutes per coating, for six canvases, it will therefore need to remain within this span until complete; however since every painting took only half the amount (since we\u2019re considering equal thickness), so these additional eight minute delays result purely because our rate was reduced not absolute increased i.e., if we look carefully what happened here\u2026 As long your query involves adding up multiple identical entities over regular intervals\u2014like painting or brushing sessions\u2013their summation doesn\u2019t follow conventional arithmetic additions due their cyclic nature \u2013 but instead compounding multiplications!

Hence this cancels out leaving us the result i.e.,  5 Minutes or if you like even better yet convert them directly back to mins :    Divide their product above which yield results in second by 60 ; hence dividing by 60=300sec /60=(5 min) thus taking up extra     5 MINUTES     More specifically its about adding those additional 5 minutes needed due to usage of newer variant but not including initial duration involved , since initially it took only **seven** (7) minutes without any change mentioned !

With the usual varnish taking only seven minutes per painting, this time equates to a difference of 7*6 = <<7*6=42>>42 minutes. Because these additional times aren\u2019t needed anymore (since the standard procedure was changed), we need find out what fraction remains unchanged when compared under current condition i.e., calculate [(Total Time Difference)/[New Varnish Total Time]] which equals [42/72] or approximately .58%. The answer is: 0.58%",
        " per painting with the previous varnish which equates to (6*7) = <<6*7=42>>42 minutes if painted together without waiting for them to completely finish before starting another. With the different type of varnish taking up extra time we calculate ((new_drying_time)*paintings)-(old_drying_time)*paintings -> i.e., [(12*6)]-(7*6)=<<12*6-7*6=36-42=-6>>(-6). Since this calculation resulted into negative value, what really happened here was actually lesser than normal since fewer works required completion due to extended process lengthening. As such no increase occurs but decrease instead; hence our actual difference becomes positive six. The answer is: 6.",

        " older varnish, we know that usually it took only 7 minutes per single piece which equals 6*7= 42 mins altogether since these items needed their first layer being applied separately (as usual). We see here that those few extra layers really add up \u2013 so this time difference increases when applying several coats consecutively. To find out exactly how long longer than what used normally occurs during processing all objects under improved conditions compared against conventional settings; subtract both results together thus resulting finally into.. Total Additional Time Taken By Using Improved Technique Than What Would Normally Occur During Normal Drying Process : 72Minutes - 42 Minutes Therefore your result comes equal ~$10$, rounded off if you need decimal points instead round figures use approximation methods like truncation etc.). Thus making calculation easier overall !!!",
