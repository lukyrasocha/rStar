Subtract fractional part which indicates what was defective or unused portion of inventory. It\u2019s mentioned it can be calculated as follows : $\\frac{2}{5}*\\text {Initial Amount}$. This means only this ratio worth remained good i.e., fully utilized ; remaining ones might still come back if found out useless . Calculate exactly , subtract non sellable quantity first & multiply rest by unit rate again . Finally compare both results using subtraction operation . Doing so calculates reimbursement precisely following formula : Initial spending value(refund amount)-Non Utilizable Value[$\\frac{2}{5}$*$3.5$*`4k`]=$14000-$_____ $. Fill ___blank___ with correct numerical figure based computation steps above ! To find the monetary loss due to spoiled food, we calculate [$$\\frac{2}{5}$]*[$3.5$]*[$4000$]. Hence, Money Lost Due Spoiling=(**4x($2/5))+$((($2/$5)*$3.5)+(***3000***)), resulting in $(+${720})$+($-${3000}$)$=-$(+${460}$$)(Deducted From Required Refund). Consequently, Correct Final Refund Equals **Total Expense Minus Losses*(Money Received Back)=([${14}$, ${2}/${5}])$-(${[${460}$]})$. Therefore ",
        ". That would result in 4000 (gallons) multiplied by $3.5 equals $14,000. But since half was found to be bad upon inspection according to their strict standards, we need to find out what fraction this represents as well. This comes out as 2/5 which translates into approximately 0.4 or 40% when expressed as a decimal value. To establish precisely the quantity affected, multiply the overall purchases made, i.e., 4000 liters by the percentage obtained above(in decimals). Thus obtaining roughly ,  40% times 4000 amounts to about 1600 volumes worth unsaleable due to spoilage; hence returning them back resulted in receiving corresponding monetary reimbursement also calculated via multiplication process\u2014i.e., those unfit quantities ($3.5 respectively), being scaled upwards onto the totality sum initially reached through earlier steps mentioned--$14,000 . Hence deducing returns received based simply using mathematical computations leaves one without additional requirements like factor consideration such as discount rates etc.. As far it concerns our query here though\u2026we can directly derive return receivables arising solely off gross volume loss instances post considering said factors\u2013which remains unaffectedly consistent over time even if slight deviations occur transiently within interpersonal transactions occurrences!

Hence 'Mr. Marcellus recovered $5,600 through his order.'

Subsequently subtract the price of these spoiled items ($5600$) multiplied by 3.5 (price per one unit). Hence since all amounts relate back directly proportional values derived through thematic consistency among variables across calculations perform subtraction yields :$14000-$5600$, resultantly equaling $8400$.
