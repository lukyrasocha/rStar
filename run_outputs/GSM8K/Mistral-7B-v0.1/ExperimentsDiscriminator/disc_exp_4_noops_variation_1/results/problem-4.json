To find out the remaining parts before placing them we subtract what was already placed from the original amount; hence 1000 \u2013 250 (the part poppy put) leaves us with 750. We can calculate one piece being thrid off this set as follows : Third Set / Total Remaining Pieces= Number per Mom\u2019s Placement ; Hence , Numerator =Moms Placed Value X Thrice This Amount(One Part From Original); Which makes sense since if it says 'a third', means all three equal portions or sets altogether make up our larger picture .

        " of pieces removed when Mom put it together; since your parent took away (one third) what was leftover from before (three fourth), you get ((x*m)/(1+((a/b)*d))). Put those numbers into the formula above using percent values instead of decimals as follows : ((total*(1-(perecentage taken))) / (1+(percentage taken_for another player)). You would calculate this equation like this ; here, percentage % means per hundred or perecantage , not multiply .
