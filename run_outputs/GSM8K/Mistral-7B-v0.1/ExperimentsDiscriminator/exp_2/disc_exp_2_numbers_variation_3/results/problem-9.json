Third thing why consider factors separately instead mixing together before calculating altogether? Here\u2018s simple reason:- Dividing vs Multiplying Factors When working arithmetically using variables always separate multiplication terms individually prior performing reduction simplification process rather than combining all expressions up front.(for example reducing f*g^2/(f^-n)= g^-n / n ) Also notice negative exponent rules apply directly onto algebraic equations too regardless whether positive integers involved initially(-ax)^r=(\u2212a)+rx)(ab)-k=[b]+[kr]).

        " shoplifters (which would equal to 3(X)) plus twice the amount already calculated which includes all others being removed due shopping violations was also included. This can lead us towards solving our equation as follows :",
        " Simplifying these equations tells us we can solve them simultaneously; therefore, solving yields that X=8 (Shoplifters). Total Kickouts include Refusing Mask (-4), Shoplifters (+8), Physical Violence Over Goods(-24); so Other Reasons could mean Positive numbers if considering different categories which isn\u2019t specifically mentioned here but based upon negative values listed above would equate to -(Refusing Mask+Shoplifters)+Physically violent kickout=-[(4)-8]-(2*8)=-(4-16)=12 positives i.e., positive count excluding specific violations hence considered as 'other'. Therefore, you conclude it results into about ten persons being expelled due to various non specified causes. The answer is: 10."
