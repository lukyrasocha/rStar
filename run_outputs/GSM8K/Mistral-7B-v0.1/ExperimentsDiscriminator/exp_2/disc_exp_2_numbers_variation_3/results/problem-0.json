To figure what happened when we multiply these numbers it helps to align their digits according to proper place values as follows: Multiply all individual digit pairs starting from rightmost columns moving towards increasing powers up until you reach no further rows than your lesser significant factor(i.e., last row) having used only whole zeros filling other remaining space while keeping everything else within its original column boundaries including any carry overs made along way already through previous multiplication steps itself back down toward lower significances so leave whatever remains unchanged unless necessary but otherwise disregard such spaces altogether whether filled intentionally elsewhere prior addition subtraction division etc..
