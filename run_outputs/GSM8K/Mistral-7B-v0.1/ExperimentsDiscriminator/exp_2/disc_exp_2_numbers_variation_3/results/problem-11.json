To rectify things let me recalculate everything starting again but pay careful attention this time around . Start off by figuring out exactly how many seats were offered across every mode of transportation used during this excursion into town using my previous calculation process : Buses provided maximum carrying capability equal to approximately one sixth(of entire workforce since their numbers far exceed even ten digit figures!)those being  94x5 or '470'; Minibus fleets catering close quartet i.e., about twenty percent+ three fifth% respectively equaled roughly , summing to 1/8 per person ; while mini Coopers albeit serving fewer folks than either bargraph size truck alternatives combined however contributed significantly within said proportions owing vast differences amidst sizes themselves.. Hence if company owns ~n members=~93k therefore proportionately lesser amount still exists via van pool yet also accommodations overall remain somewhat high thus leading down pathway towards conclusion ! But wait till last word before taking note what really matters most herein ... It simply doesn\u2019t matter anyway whether employee attendance hits rock bottom low barrier point beyond minimum threshold required just above zero %. Employees having decided against partaking despite availability prove inconsequential unless absolute displeasure caused complete absence subsequently resulting negative impact affecting efficiency & productivity levels henceforth hinder performance capabilities ultimately undermining whole team effort initiatives set forth aim achieving business growth goals ..
