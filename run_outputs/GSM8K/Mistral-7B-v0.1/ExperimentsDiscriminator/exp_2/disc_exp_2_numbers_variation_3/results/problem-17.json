However, it was previously stated that the straight line geographic distance from Anchorage, AK (\"Alaska\") to Brownsville, TX (\"Texas\") along I-90 W & US HWY 2 is approximately about 2730 miles or roughly equivalent to ~4,418 kilometers according to Google Maps data usage). Therefore, even over these assumed speeds, Michael could not achieve full journey as only nearly half of required kilometerage reached through such conditions i.e., around 2400 Km out of 4418km possible route represents approximately `((2400/4418)*100)%`\u2248 `~54.26 %`.
