We thus conclude: All things considered combined including varying training frequencies like interval workouts would amount toward quite different totals when accounting daily activities versus monthly ones instead though certainly increasing intensity may produce improved outcomes whereas neglect could lead towards loss both physically & mentally alike depending largely upon personal choices made henceforth moving forward within these scenarios specific cases exist naturally therefore making generalizations impossible except possibly along lines concerning average human bodies behaviors under similar conditions otherwise\u2026 Hence calculating exactly precisely becomes difficult sometimes unless provided certain fixed parameters around said variables involved alongside additional knowledge regarding factors such exercises performed during specified periods too often causing fluctuations ultimately altering expected results further complicating matters slightly thereby preventing simple linear calculations based off past experiences alone usually best practiced using complex mathematical functions involving extensive data sets gathered through observation studies conducted methodically among relevant subjects repeatedly ensuring accuracy via various measurement techniques etc..
