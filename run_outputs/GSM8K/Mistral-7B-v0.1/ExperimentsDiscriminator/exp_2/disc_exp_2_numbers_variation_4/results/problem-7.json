Convert the difference into Caloric intake based off their individual values per carbohydrate content. To find this you add up all those numbers above, multiply them together, and convert it according to its value i.e. if 'x' represents your desired variable , therefore ; X=((total no Carbs Difference)*calorie count /carb count; Since we know any single unit/cookies equate to  154 Calories Hence We can substitute these variables accordingly thus substituting our previous equation results..X=((((15+24)-(5+6))*154)/1.

Here we already obtained the result before converting anything else hence eliminating unnecessary steps like introducing a new variable symbol etc since most people understand plain language better without symbols representing different data points unless absolutely required due context clarity within math problems themselves being presented differently thereby allowing readers easier time following through logical reasoning processes associated mainly during Math Solving Sequence tasks involving various computations along side simplifying equations towards finding Final Solution statements made via direct correlation versus referencing hypothetical variables throughout multiple stages rather directly jumping straight onto concluding numerical answers derived strictly upon fulfillment conditions related solely respective specific figures mentioned clearly & sequentially alongside proper mathematical operations performed accurately adherent corresponding order precedence rules dictated essential relevance placements whenever handling complex algebraic expressions requiring careful attention toward maintaining consistency while preserving integrity amongst said elements whilst ensuring precision regarding calculation methods applied wherever possible always keeping thoroughness level high across whole process overall making sure not leaving out even smallest detail possibly affect outcome significantly under circumstances demand utmost accuracy regardless complexity dealing large amounts varying types diverse information sources involved present challenges sometimes provoking frustration especially when encounter roadblocks yet persistence keeps everyone going forward eventually yield successful completion thanks God bless s o man u doing job right well keep pushing harder",

Since both girls shared their consumption equally per day, you divide it into equal halves making half being attributed to just one girl; thus Sarah or any other friend/mother would experience around approximately [(Total Difference) / Total Number Days] i.e., [1418/(2)] which amounts up to about 709 excess daily calories relative to others due to consuming those extra three cookies every single time!

To see exactly what extra workouts might yield results try comparing their breakfast routine together \u2013 perhaps taking note how often either girl needs sugary cereals before dinner compared when alone instead\u2026 And remember not all kids love vegetables but sometimes making things exciting helps get people through hard tasks like cutting down fat intake later while still enjoying life overall \u2026 Cheers everybody!! :) .

Hence, Suze consumes approximately around 1232caloric intake higher per session .

It was calculated earlier; it equals 5 (Monday) + 6 (Tuesday), which totals 11 cookies.

        " Tuesday together; this equals 15+24=39 cookies altogether. Multiply these values by the amount of Cal per cooking (i.e., we assume one) to get Calorie intake, which comes out equal to 39*154 = <<39*154=5986>>5986 kCal. Similarly calculate the summed sugar consumption of all three girls over the time period indicated using similar reasoning above. We see here again that our goal was not only answered but also checked against logic since it\u2019s impossible logically if Suzie actually consumed lesser grams/ounces or equivalent measure while consuming overall greater mass units based on differing amounts across respective individuals despite their individual count being low due to differences inherent within multiplication factors applied individually. Thus no specific information nor context regarding quantities beyond numerical calculation without further qualifications available could reliably support inferences drawn solely through computational analysis alone \u2014 instead requiring either additional data detail about comparative ingestion levels relative terms such percentages etc.; however assuming typical dietary patterns likely represent realistic scenarios regardless variations found when comparing direct numeral outputs calculated directly below).

Similarly, because Sue eat four times as many cookies on Tuesday; this means she ate 6(her sister) * 4 = <<6*4=24>>24 cookies. Thus she took during second day equal to  24 (number of cookies she had ) * 154(Number of Calorie contained within one Cookie)=<<24*154=3696>>3696 kcal . Adding up the quantities calculated above, it appears Sue consumes approximately 2310+3696 = <<2310+3696=5990>>5990kCal altogether across both weekdays. Meanwhile if you subtract from their combined intake the amount equivalent to what was taken off only by Suzie\u2019 s sibling over same period , which equals ((five)(fifty eight)-((five)+(six))*(one fifty six)),it amounts about 5396 KCals.(Five plus Six yields Eleven).
