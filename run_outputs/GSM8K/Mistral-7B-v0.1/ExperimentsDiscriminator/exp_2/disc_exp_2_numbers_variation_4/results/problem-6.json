To find out what each pair of pants costs we need to add up the prices of both items together ($76+$228=$304), divide this price evenly between them since it was not specified otherwise because you cannot split clothing item but rather purchase pairs or singles depending if its size availability allows it etc). Hence, your pair(s)/single would come in at half their combined price per single/pair making sure one isn\u2019t priced higher than another when purchased alone; so $(304 / 2)=$152! This means all items put altogether equal 456 (Hat+Jacket+Pant=1+2+(average value calculated above)) before taxes being applied anywhere along any chain supply continuum due no indication provided about such additional fees occurring outside direct purchasing event scenarios described herein henceforth disregarded thus leading us toward conclusion below accordingly:-   Total Uniform Cost:$**",
