Since this happens individually 4 times as every kid purchased them once we can simply multiply their individual expenses together multiplied above calculation hence yielding us ((4*136)*4=$2176) As it stands $((4*$34)*$4)=($2*(dividend/divisor))=(totalCost/$numberOfChildren)$=",
        " four children, so multiplying these quantities together we find that \\( \\text{Number Of Children} = \\text {Pairs Per Child } \\times 4\\). Therefore if \\( P=\\$34 \\) (price), the multiplication comes out as follows;   \\(\\begin{aligned} & (\\text { Number Of Children })=(\\text { Total Cost}) /( \\text { Price Each}), \\\\& 4\\cdot( 4) =\\left (\\dfrac{\\$34}{}\\right)\\Rightarrow \\$136 . \\end{aligned}\\)So altogether it costs $\\136$. Which means that the correct option here would be $(\\$136)$ which isn\u2019t included within your choices but based off this analysis I can only assume you made those selections accidentally or otherwise incorrectly since none came close enough..

        " of shoes in total (one set per child). Each shoe costs $34 so multiply this amount times sixteen which equals 34 x 16 =  544$. This shows us that it\u2019ll take him $544$ to purchase those four sets of footwear if one was priced equally as expensive. However since we know these prices vary across brands due to production methods used etc., but because you haven\u2019t specified such details let me assume every single pack worth same quantity came about equal rates; thus I shall say no further adjustments needed here except maybe tax deductions \u2013 or perhaps discount coupons!

        " makes it one shoe per child. Since all four kids get this amount, we multiply three times as well \u2013 getting 4*4=16 individual shoes/pairs. Each pair costs him $34 therefore making everything so far equal up to (16)*$34=$544 spent overall. Hence, the answer is:  544$.",
        " individual shoes per child (since every pair contains 2). Since he has 4 children, it becomes 8*4=32 shoes altogether. Each shoe costs him $34/pair divided by 2 since we consider only one part out of two when calculating single price due to pairs meaning 'two items together'. Therefore, each piece sold individually would actually sell as cheap as half its price; so, $34/2 equals $17. Thus, for all four kids combined this means multiplying original quantity of shoes by their unit value ($17) resulting into overall amount spent equaling:  32*$17=$544. Hence, $$544 was paid completely if no discount or extra tax applies during sale time period specified throughout question text passage content.. ",
