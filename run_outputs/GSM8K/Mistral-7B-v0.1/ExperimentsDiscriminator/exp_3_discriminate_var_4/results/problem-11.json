We \u2018 re talking about real life here . Don \u2019 s right\u2013 It ' s just simple common calculation without rounding needed ! But wait , wasn T suppose include any extra calculations involving different shapes etc which might complicate matters further ? Well good news indeed !! All thanks goes back onto basics rather easily once broken down logically thus far anyway \u2026 Ohh oh okay yeah cool point made :) Thank u very much :D Much better understand w h o i s going ON TH E N EXPECTATIONAL COURSE OF LYING OBJECTED TO AN INTERNATIONAL LAW BASET WITH RESPONSIVE CLAIMSTHIS IS NOT WHAT YOU MIGHT BE SEEKING FROM ME HERE ;-) My bad .. sorry :( Could appreciate though ... Bye / Have a great weekend ahead!!! Regards From Zoran Gajic | Support Engineer @ StackOverflow || Twitter \u2022 Linktree ",
        " these four buses would equal 4 x 76 = 304 seats. Next determine if you need both small vehicles or not since one isn\u2019t enough(minibus+vvan=27 people.) We already found out that only sixteen extra students could go as it was mentioned earlier ,that ninetysix passengers fit into all busses . Since we still don\u2019t know whether any other vehicle needs to help fill up spaces; therefore either take another smaller van first before taking the remaining students onto the vans.. Add together those numbers.(i) Total Capacity Of Large Buses & Minibuses Combined:   3*large bus (totaling thirtyfour)=three hundred forty   Plus Two*Minivan= One sixtyseven     TOTAL FOR FIRST PART OF VEHICLES TO CONTAIN STUDENTS OR EMPLOYEES:            Six Hundred Fifty Seven Students/Employees Will Be Transported By All Vehicles First Step..... And lastly add...         Numberof Employees Remaining To Ride:(Ninety six-(Three Forty)) Equals Sixty Three Hence.... Therefore Adding them Up!... Finally ...        Numerical ",
        " smaller vehicles (mini buses and vans) using their individual capacities multiplied by their respective quantities as per instruction above): Minibus Capacity: The question says that every minivan holds 8 people but we only need information about mini buses which it said could fit up to three times its regular passengers. Since the standard size mentioned was less than half compared to other vehicle sizes this indicates one full passenger fits into four units or groups within these particular vehicles hence indicating the conventional value i.e., if you cut down your seating space evenly based off just knowing such details would suggest around twelve seats across all those specific bumper style pickups \u2013 thus making our calculation below complete : Total Mini Bus/Van Seats= ((NumberOfBuses+Minibeasts)*TotalCapacitiy)/MaxSeatPerBus; Hence::(((3*2)+3*(3*9))/(76+(24))) ; Thus:(((3*2)+3*(3*9))/(76+(24)=18 )=(6+(81) / 100)=(13)(8%=96); Therefore according_to _our calculations when taken together both types&quantitiesof small transport medium\u2019as well &therefore overallseatsavailableforemployeestothecompanyiscalculatedbelow :-Google Company Vehicle Fleet TotalseatsAvailableToEmployees=-(-[({{10}}{{differenttypesoftravel|touserCompany|google}})])={{-[(76(*){bus})+(3*{mobilebusies)})]+{[{(3*12)}]*3}+ {{(8)}}]}={{\u2212[]} [(76)+(3*{9}))]+[{({(12)}{multiplesizeinbaseunit)}]= [{(96)]};andthensinceifwewantacomparisonbetweennumbersofpeoplecapitalizesuchthatonepersonconsistsomeamountorportionoffuelcostthensuchconversionsareneeded:{Theratio=AimEfficiencyLevel/{FuelCostForOneEmployee};Hence:[(TodaysMoneyNeedsAssessmentInLightofHowManyPeopleCapiationCanBeLivedWithByEachIndividualEquipotentialMember]\u00d7[(SumtotalGrossPricingValueOrMonetaryBenefitAssociatedwithAllWorkersWhoWill",
        " total capacity of these buses is 9 * 30 = 270 employees. Multiply this result by three because we want to add it up instead of subtracting which would mean only one third part outgoing. To avoid confusion or errors when adding together very big numbers here you may find subtraction easier as long as all values involved remain positive integers! Add another vehicle type mentioned within your question \u2013 namely vans which carry fewer people than any other kind vehicles used during said excursion\u2026 Subtract off those extra passengers taken aboard already accounted transportation methods including both full size ones above but not necessarily exclusive amongst them since multiple types might exist depending upon circumstances surrounding events occurring simultaneously over time periods varying greatly across differents localities while still providing sufficient information regarding individual travel experiences available via means listed earlier due too variance observed whenever possible throughout several regions worldwide using standard formats specified below alongside relevant descriptors applicable according situation specific requirements unique per person circumstance being considered based solely upon personal preferences indicated thus explaining exactly what constitutes appropriate behavior expected thereby encouraging cooperation among participants regardless whether doing anything illegal occurs anywhere near vicinity located proximal respective communities sharing similar geographical features shared elsewhere otherwise adjacent neighbours living nearby cities alike distant places far away lands apart oceans deep sea bottom trenches beneath continents entire earth surface excluding polar caps northernmost latitudes arctic zone Antarctica southern ocean equatorial waters temperatures cold warm climatic conditions weather patterns frequent rains storm systems hurricanes cyclones typhoons tornadoes dust clouds fog mist lightning electrical discharge spark strikes floods tidal waves crests surges swell barriers breaches levees breaks rivers banks overflow channels deluges drought years dehydrations desiccated vegetation dying crops wildfires burning widespread forest fires catastrophically damaging massive loss lives property destruction natural environment agriculture industries services sectors economy society governments nations government institutions political parties groups corporations business entities financial establishments organizations trade unions labor class citizens peoples masses population demographics age generations cohorts cultures ethnicity national origin race gender identity sexual orientation religious beliefs philosophies scientific discoveries technologies innovations artistic expressions popular culture trends fashions styles genres cuisines culinary arts cookery techniques recipes ingredients flavorings seasonings spices condiments garnishes sau"
