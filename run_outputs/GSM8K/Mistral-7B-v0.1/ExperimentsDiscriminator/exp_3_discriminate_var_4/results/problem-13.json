To find out exactly how many stayed unscared I need your clarification because throwing objects usually hurts animals and might not result positively regardless of our intentions! However, assuming hypothetically three fourths remain: Calculate using fractions which represent remaining count i.e., Remaining_Birds=Total Bird*Fraction Survived =>  99*(4/3) =>  132 .
