This can be calculated simply by subtracting the original drying time from this newly increased value: |New Varnishing Time \u2013 Old Varnishing Time| or abs(newVariningTime - oldVarnizingTime). Replace 'newVariningTime', 'oldVarnizingTime', etc., with their respective values obtained previously so we get: absolute_value(-20), which evaluates exactly into our desired resultant variable, hence: The extra waiting period caused due to switching over onto the new varnishing method amounts up to twenty units quantified in terms relatable timing elements such as minutes herein described within question context.
