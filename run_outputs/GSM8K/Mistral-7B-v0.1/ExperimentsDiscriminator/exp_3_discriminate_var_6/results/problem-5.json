Multiply the individual price times quantity purchased which leads us to roughly $(49.5)*(18)=$891 rounded off. Thus ,Richard ended up spending about around $. Therefore the correct choice can only either be 'a' based on our calculation rounding error if allowed but technically none match exactly due to approximation introduced by half dollar pricing assumption when determining actual countable units involved here.
