Therefore, if 5 turtles are going together (each as slowy walking compared against individual time), this implies their combined time would also equal what was taken previously, only halved due to slower speeds. So instead we can simply look at relative rates which means our new effective team rate becomes equivalent to having twice fewer than before since every single creature here works effectively double less. Hence, doubling up results into getting another set of whole numbers while preserving ratios. As such your original figure gets divided down correspondingly resulting in us seeing something like : Original Ratio / New Rate_per_turtle^kanga_group*rate_per_newteam(where n=numberofcreaturesinold+noduplicate). Working out these figures result in 1*(Rate Per Kangara)/((half)(Team consisting solely of Turtles)*K)) hence ending off around ((Total Time required)=NewTimeRequired/OriginalRatio) or Final",

One hour translates into doubled distance traveled; hence every minute results in zero work being accomplished (because no motion can result without effort which isn\u2019t mentioned), essentially indicating we aren\u2019t calculating distances or moving units accurately within these parameters because 'half the speed implies lesser efficiency', yet all entities require movement before any effective task completion\u2014which cannot happen instantaneously based upon standard biological principles.
