We can see its 33 \u2013 28 = 5 points still required which means on other half question round Sue answers wrong or missing up only one point , since it mentions not getting less than perfect marks . Hence as every single option contains higher mark scored here even though all options lie greater but closest to minimum possible mistake yet above our result hence choice 'e'.

Since both tests are equally long (each one consists out of 50 questions), Susan needs exactly half those extra points i.e., just under another quarter point per question to achieve this goal or precisely six answers as you can\u00b4t solve fractions of examination items(the item values are integral). Therefore, since it isn\u2019t possible to score partially among integer figures concerning individual exams results, either passing would require getting all fifteen available choices accurate across board during retake sessions \u2013 not even considering potential scoring systems adjustments throughout revision efforts; however if scores could vary slightly according statistical models used within pedagogical methodologies employed while preparing students academically prior commencement assessment scenarios instead using absolute numerical measures based solely upon counting hits without consideration toward relative value scales like letter grades etc.: thus suggesting optimal performance criteria align themselves closer towards achieving desired percentage threshold yet still remaining realistically attainable/achievable barometers despite any specific case scenario analysis limitations imposed due inherent constraints associated educational frameworks aiming fairness over strict punitive action via grading rubric designs\u2026 As such calculation may appear somewhat cumbersome initially especially when factorizing different variables mentioned previously together hence necessitating advanced mathematical computations necessary before determining precise amount needed offending student requires obtain maximum feasible level compliance accordingly current curriculum expectations placed regarding subject proficiency levels relevant specifically term time period stipulated thereby defining acceptable standards achievable against stated benchmark objectives intended through course syllabuses presented earlier stage academic development phase generally speaking but which furthermore implies broader interpretation allowing reasonable variation dependent particular circumstances considered might arise herewith depending personalised experiences gained whilst undertaking challenges posed alongside unique set requirements mandated enforced strictly adhering established parameters ensuring continued progress forward moving upward ladder successfully completing foundational training phases ahead ultimately transition proceedings leading unto higher tier professional disciplines subsequent post degree pathways pursued following graduate education career aspirations achieved reaching lofty goals acquired accumulating valuable accreditations sought enhancing capabilities cultivated learned skills obtained perfecting newly developed techniques taught applying innovative approaches devised improving overall quality standardized outputs reached consistently resulting steady growth trend witness observed ever evolving industry practices adopted practiced routinely maintained implemented repeatedly refined tailored customizable approach taken applied systematically continuously reinforced improved constantly upgraded incorporating latest modern advancements introduced",
