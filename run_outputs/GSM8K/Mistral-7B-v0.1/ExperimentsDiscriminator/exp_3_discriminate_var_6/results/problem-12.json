Therefore it would look like this: Cost Before Discount = (6 x $1) + (11 x $2) + ($10) + ($12). Next let\u2019s determine what percentage the customer pays when receiving an 18 percent off sale. That means if you spent exactly XYZ amount during checkout time instead of paying full purchase, your payment becomes only ((X*100%) \u2013 18%). Thus [(XYZ)*(92/100)]= Final Payment or simply [(((6*$1)+($10))+ $(12* $2*(1-(18))))] This works out as such:[$6+(44)-($21.6)=$38.4]. Hence, I deduced that Robert needs to shell out nearly $38.4 following a transaction inclusive of taxes and fees which may further inflate the expense marginally due to additional charges applied post sales transactions.<|end_of_instructions|> Here",
        " $6 spent on notebooks. Additionally, 11 pens costing $2 each add up to 11 x $2 = $22 spent on pens. Similarly, buying 1 calculator means spending its base rate which is $10 per unit or simply just $10 as you only need one. Adding this sum ($10) together gets us $38 without any deductions yet (which would be represented mathematically like so --> [$6+($2x11)+(C=$10)]). However, the scenario provides information regarding promotional actions conducted inside the store such as applying a 18% decrease in prices. To account for them, multiply every subtotal obtained prior till here including our recent accumulated value i.e., $38 by the indicated % reduction formula -> [(Discount Rate)*Total Subtotals]/(1+(Discount Rate)), because when dealing with percentage reductions, it effectively leaves something outstanding worth remaining if said original amounts represent whole values before decrement occurred (.

Good luck keeping track without spending extra effort tracking changes every few weeks especially during busy seasons such summer holidays & winter break periods amongst others maybe???

The store offers an 18% discount off this original price (since it was mentioned clearly), so we need to find out what amount would represent that percentage of these total initial prices before any subtractions occur or changes happen as well; which means multiplying directly instead subtracting/subtractive operations along while using brackets since those apply later). To convert percentages into decimals just divide them upwards per hundredth place value such as 'twenty divided through twenty times ten equals four.'
