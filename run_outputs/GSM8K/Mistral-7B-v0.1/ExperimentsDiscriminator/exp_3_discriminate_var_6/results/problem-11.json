Since both capacities add up to less than required (228+210=438 which doesn\u2019t match), we need to use additional vehicles but preferably bigger ones since smaller would require extra trips; therefore it makes sense to prioritize filling up buses first as larger space reduces cost per passenger hence resulting into higher utilization rate. Add these totals together yields 438 passengers being accommodated altogether through different means during this outing while remaining mindful any employee exceed limit may not fit comfortably due either limited seat/space inside chosen transports thus potentially leaving few extras waiting behind barriers despite their enthusiasm towards attending said events etc albeit everyone gets along well regardless no grudges ensue nor hard feelings amongst themselves post adventures outside office premises even though initially reserved disagreement about selections made pre planning phase earlier back when bidding teams vied against another competitor seeking similar propositions beforehand ending ultimately neither side coming forth victorious still reaching mutual accord whilst keeping professional integrity intact further reinforcing importance maintain healthy working relationships amongst staff members hereon forward throughout existence moving forward never again allow such misunderstandings arise yet ensure better communication within department next time around thereby averting possible future conflicts among peers caused merely accidental lack knowledge regarding specific aspects involved relating various parties engaged directly related thereto .
