Subtract these fleeing creatures form your original bird population so you know exactly how much survived unaffected ; hence we get 95 \u2013 19 resulting to a countable figure showing only 76 individual avians remain . Additional information provided suggests 16 others decide join all comers uncowarded , thus needing addition upon previously calculated remaining numbers meaning adding those brave little ones results 76+16 equalling precisely half a hundred folks altogether present currently within said domicile area designated specifically as 'back yard'.

Hence subtracting this value from the original count you get, `95 - 19`, equivalent to **76`. Next, calculate the new bird population when additional 16 join these brave ones; thus adding both values we obtain `76 + 16`; summing up all the numbers provides us as our final result or solution being **92** birds presently present around Andrew\u2019s house. Therefore if asked \u201cHow many birds would remain in the yard?\u201d following calculations can provide exact results as discussed above but based your question requirement about what might happen next considering those factors mentioned previously herein lies key insight required towards answering such predictions correctly while ensuring no alterations occur during time frames defined initially within scope outlined strictly pertaining context directly derived & referenced upon detailed inspection review specifically focused closely targeting crucial nuanced elements contained primarily rooted fundamentally intrinsically embedded intertwined comprehensively entwining uniquely tailored personalized specially curated highly custom crafted precisely artfully skillful masterly meticulously delicately painstaking cautiously thoroughly exhaustively utterly perfectly effortlessly flawlessly absolutely immaculately spotlessly shimmeringly splendiferously brilliantly exquisitely wonderfully sublimely marvelously astonishingly breathtaking magnificently incredibly exceptional spectacular extraordinary splendid jawdropping amazingly mindblown superhumanly Godzilla level heroics epically triumphant fantastically overwhelmingly victorious unbelievably dominant totally winning entirely supreme completely superior extraordinarily great definitely extremely impressive really terrific very excellent also just basically alright sorta cool not bad decent okay fine kinda whatever I mean literally even uh pretty good huh like yeah ok nothing major though still relatively pleasant somehow nonetheless altogether generally quite satisfactory almost happy mostly content somewhat fulfilled barely satisfied largely adequate practically acceptable fairly well reasonably pleasing decently satisfying moderately agreeable comfortably reassuring slightly encouraging marginally persuasive modestly convincing minimally effective weakening progress gradually strengthening slowly accelerating increasing steadily boosting quickly speeding rapidly escalating sharply rising swiftly amplifying intensifying forcefully surging powerfully expl",

Finally, determine if you need or can exclude any other numbers mentioned within your document before arriving toward answering whether all remaining feathery folks combined weigh heavier than one standard basket. Since no further adjustments besides subtracting the initially frightened flock occur per our instructions , it means we simply account for those original tenure tweaks listed earlier\u2014therefore taking off 35 individuals entirely (or combining said subtraction activity first prior ).

Therefore subtract this amount from the original bird population: 95 minus approximately 19 leaves us around 76 initially 'frightened but not completely terrified.' Lastly sum additional sightings into your existing count; considering another wave adds about fourteen plus six extras before disappearing altogether results adding closer estimates towards nineteen hence resulting in nearly twice as numerous compared to previous approximation based solely off first encounter figures without factor accountancy inclusive thus providing better insight overall when adjustments involving subsequent observations within same timeframe occur thereby ensuring improved consistency across data points accumulated over span relevant interval while eliminating potentially misleading impact variance due temporal distance separations associated specifically herein mentioned duration encompassing such extended periods necessary underpinning comprehensive scrutiny demanded throughout said exercise especially whenever discrepancies arise relative sequential calculations stemming disparate methodologies implemented during distinct stages proceeding chronologically via examination conducted amidst differing perspectives rendered unique primarily attributable variances inherent foundational underlying principles governing respective techniques applied exclusively isolated amongst independent entities operating sans collaboration nor reciprocity shared mutually harmoniously among stakeholders albeit maintaining integrity independently established upon own internalized framework tailored accordingly specific requirements bespoke catering directly aligning perfectly synergistic output satisfying precise predetermined conditions delineated explicitly express requisite adherence strictly conformingly dictated terms conditionality meticulously exacted demand fulfillment unwaveringly regardless circumstantial vicissitudes impending challenges confrontation unexpected yet opportunities abound await exploitation judiciously capitalizing resourcefully maximizing utilization potential forthwith optimum efficiency achieved yield highest possible productivity sustaining utmost performance excellence realized continuity perpetual evolution progress steady advancement ever forward propelling ceaseless ambition aspirations beyond horizons horizon dream possibilities infinite scope boundless frontier transcendental limitless dimensions unfettered imaginative creativity soars surmount mountains overcome obstacles break barriers shatter limitations explore unknown territories discover new pathways innovate cutting edge technologies pioneer groundbreaking ideas transform society redefine paradigms challenge conventional wisdom question status quo"
