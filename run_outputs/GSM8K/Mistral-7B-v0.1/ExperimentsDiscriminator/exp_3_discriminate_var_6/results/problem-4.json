Once those initial pieces are removed it leaves us with a remainder which can also include all non piece countable items; therefore we cannot say exactly what happened afterwards (i.e., exact numbers). Therefore I am unable help you solve this one based off information provided thus date back here again if any additional info about placement post removal was included but still not enough detail presented without going into speculations or hypothetical scenarios like having fractional portion calculations etc.: https://www.mathway.com/",

Next determine how many additional pieces this equates to; take these calculated numbers (5339) and multiply them times three because we want only a single segment here representing our missing values before any further reductions via maternal contribution occur within the solution process. Therefore, as per above reasoning calculations indicated multiplying again would lead towards incorrect representation causing confusion henceforth let s avoid those steps Instead continue directly determining what fraction Mrs placed using simple fractions division principles thus if half divided equals six equal parts out of twelve means exactly thrice fewer than original complete sets present during initial stages consider such relationships while proceeding accordingly following similar logic lines apply correct proportions correctly resulting yields thereby maintain accuracy ensuring clearest understanding throughout entire resolution efforts involving various portions allocation strategies involved clearly establish respective interrelationships defining precise quantities representative accurate snapshots mirroring real scenario dynamic flow adjustments taking place over course whole progression sequence progress continuation journey through specific subsection areas address core query components systematically approaching breakdown complex aggregated information structures sequentially applying essential basic mathematical operations conceptualizing comprehensive logical processes facilitate straightforward coherent problem resolving methods adopt pragmatic efficient time saving shortcutting techniques exploiting potential simplifications opportunities maximize clarity effectiveness efficiency whilst minimizing unnecessary complications complexity redundancies redundant details superfluous data extraneous miscellaneous items disregarding trivial nonessential minutiae unrelated pertinent relevant factors irrelevant inconsequential insignificant incidental happenstance occurrences etc ensure meticulousness precision exactitude no leeway tolerance deviations allowed errors omitted omissions rectify amend resolve clarify enhance elevate quality results yield ultimate successful satisfactory conclusive verifiable definitive justified soundly founded well reasoneda thorough cogently eloquent succinct yet encompassing explanatory fully articulated detailed lucid concise informative illustratively instructively explicitly stated forthright direct understandable readily graspible plain English language terms common vernacular dialect easily interpreted widely accessible broad spectrum audience appreciating diverse educational background varied literacy levels individuals general public anyone seeking knowledge insightful illumination wisdom guidance counsel advice assistance recommend suggestions tips tricks helpful hints useful pointers practical ideas effective measures action plans implement initiatives undertake activities conduct investig",
