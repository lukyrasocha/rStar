Compute the time traveled first since we know Daniel was driving at constant rate over consecutive hours which means duration could easily be computed as `distance=speed*time`. Hence rearrange this formula to isolate 'Time': `time=(distancia)/velocity` plugging values yields us `(4400km)/(55km per hr)` yielding you approximately equivalent to about 80 hrs or roughly equal to around fourteen workdays.(we ignored leap year) Calculate % coverage . Since it says \u201cconsecutive\u201d I\u2019m guessing its literally just simple calculation without considering multiple intervals : `% coverge=.((actual)(target))/.divide(total)`. Substituting our variables brings forth `.((80).dot(.4400))./(total)=%coverage`. We don\u2019t even need to worry any units so calculating simplifies further down to being only numbers:`(% coverge)=(80x.4400)/total.` Simplifying terms yields:(% coverge)=(35200/) because obviously target cancels out leaving only numerator value:% Coverage equals %.

To break down your question better i used three different approaches as follows .. First , since our goal was finding out the percentages therefore initially when setting up variables for calculations let us refer them back directly using terms mentioned first time example variable B representing 'distance'. Second because calculating distances usually begins through understanding rates so while referring again to formulae generally known regarding such cases lets name any additional quantity associated related to its description for instance V representing Volume or RatedSpeed which also refers same scenario context provided earlier H symbolising Number Of Uninterrupted Continuous Exercise Periods meaning simply no factor considered excluding rest moments during entire trip duration period ; finally last bit being Y denoting unit conversion depending specifically upon specific exercise type applied throughout journey ! It makes sense right ? Okay well next thing one could say before jump starting calculation process especially those involving conversions something called Pythagoras theorem may come handy but considering simple case non exists thus leaving space only place value systems play role keeping both sides balanced ... And although not needed yet important reminder always apply common measures according local standards whenever solving problems relating measuring lengths whether straight lines across flat surfaces normally represented area figures including square units squares meters kilograms pounds grams metric tons liters cubic centimeters gallons quarts pints fluid ounces water millilitres volumes inches metres kilometres feet yards metre cm kms hm nmi mpc ms mi miluometc....

Therefore, plugged into equations becomes: percent_reached=[(dist*(hours)/texas_distance)*100]=(55)(2)/(4400)*100=.25 approximately .
