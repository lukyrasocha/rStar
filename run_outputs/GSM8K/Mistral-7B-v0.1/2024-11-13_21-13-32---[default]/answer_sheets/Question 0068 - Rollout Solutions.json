First, we need to figure out the cost of a watermelon. It's equal to 3 times the cost of a pepper. Since each pepper costs $15, the watermelon costs 3 x $15 = $45. An orange costs 5 less than a watermelon, which makes its cost $40. Dillon is buying 4 watermelons, 20 peppers, and 10 oranges. Each watermelon costs $45, so the total cost of the watermelons is 4 x $45 = $180. Each pepper costs $15, so the total cost of the peppers is 20 x $15 = $300. And since each orange costs $40, the total cost of the oranges is 10 x $40 = $400. Adding everything up, the total amount of money spent is $180 + $300 + $400 = $880.
