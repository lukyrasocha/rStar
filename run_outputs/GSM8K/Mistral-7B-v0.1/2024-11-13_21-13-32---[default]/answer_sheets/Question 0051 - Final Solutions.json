Julia's boat sprang a leak while she was out on the lake. The boat was taking on two liters of water for every ten feet she rowed back towards shore. It took her sixteen seconds to row twenty feet. The shore was 64 seconds away. First, we need to find the rate at which the boat was taking on water. We know that the boat was taking on two liters of water for every ten feet Julia rowed. So, we can write it as 2 liters/ten feet. Next, we need to convert this rate to units per second. We can do this by dividing the rate by the distance travelled. Two liters of water for every ten feet is equivalent to two liters per ten feet divided by one second, which is two liters per second.
