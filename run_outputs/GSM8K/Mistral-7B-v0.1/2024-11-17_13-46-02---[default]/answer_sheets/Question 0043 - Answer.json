{"id": 1003, "problem": "A dance studio offers lessons to students. It costs $25 per session to rent the studio plus $1.50 per student per session. At present, the dance studio has 10 students and is rented 3 days a week. How much are the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "The total earnings from 10 students is $1.50 x 10 = $<<1.50*10=15>>15 per session.\nSo the total earnings per session is $15 + $25 = $<<15+25=40>>40.\nThus, every week the dance studio earns $40 x 3 = $<<40*3=120>>120.\nTherefore, it will earn $120 x 4 = $<<120*4=480>>480 in a month.\n#### 480", "gold_answer": "480"}
