{"id": 1059, "problem": "Imma has 3 cats. She feeds her cats twice a day with 60 grams of cat food. How many days will 720 grams of cat food last?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "The 3 cats consume 60 grams/cat x 3 cats = <<60*3=180>>180 grams of food per meal.\nSince they eat twice a day, then they consume 180 grams/meal x 2 meals/day = <<180*2=360>>360 grams in a day.\nSo, 720 grams of cat food only last for 720 grams / 360 grams/day = <<720/360=2>>2 days.\n#### 2", "gold_answer": "2"}
