{"id": 1001, "problem": "Jordan wanted to surprise her mom with a homemade birthday cake.  From reading the instructions, she knew it would take 20 minutes to make the cake batter and 30 minutes to bake the cake.  The cake would require 2 hours to cool and an additional 10 minutes to frost the cake.  If she plans to make the cake all on the same day, what is the latest time of day that Jordan can start making the cake to be ready to serve it at 5:00 pm?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "1 hour is 60 minutes so we know that 2 hours to cool the cake is the same as 2*60 so <<2*60=120>>120 min\nIt will take Jordan 20 min to make the batter, 30 to bake, 120 to cool and 10 to frost so the cake will take 20 +30 +120 +10 = <<20+30+120+10=180>>180 minutes total\nJordan needs to convert 180 minutes to hours so 180/60 = <<180/60=3>>3 hours\nIf the cake needs to be finished by 5:00 pm and it will take 3 hours total to make then 5-3 = <<5-3=2>>2:00 pm is the latest she can start making the cake\n#### 2", "gold_answer": "2"}
