Given the first condition, we know that 75 large jelly beans satiate Grandpa completely. Next, let's look at the second condition. This tells us that he can consume twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans. Lastly, the third condition informs us that eating three small beans is equivalent to one medium-sized bean. To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum amount of small jelly beans Grandpa can eat before feeling full. Since we already know that 75 large jelly beans satiate him, and we also know that 1 medium-sized bean equals 3 small beans, we can calculate the maximum amount of small jelly beans by multiplying 75 (large) by 3 (small beans per medium).
