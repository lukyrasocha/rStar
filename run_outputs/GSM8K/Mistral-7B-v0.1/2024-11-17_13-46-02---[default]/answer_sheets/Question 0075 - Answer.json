{"id": 1035, "problem": "Richard wants to make a video to share online of him doing a science experiment that creates a fountain of diet soda after placing a specific branded candy inside it. Richard's driveway is 24 feet wide and he wants to put a bottle of soda every 3 feet of the driveway. After starting at the first bottle, it will take Richard 5 seconds to go from one soda bottle to the next, dropping the candy in. How many seconds total will it take Richard to set off all the soda fountains?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "If Richard's driveway is 24 feet long and he puts a bottle of soda every 3 feet, then out of 24 feet total there are 24 / 3 feet between each bottle = <<24/3=8>>8 bottles.\nIf Richard starts at 0 seconds with the first bottle and it takes him 5 seconds to go onto the next bottle to drop the candy, then it will take him 5 seconds x 7 bottles = 35 seconds total.\n#### 35", "gold_answer": "35"}
