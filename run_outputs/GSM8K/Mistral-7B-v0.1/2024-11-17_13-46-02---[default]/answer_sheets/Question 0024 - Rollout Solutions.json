First, let's figure out how many plants will fit in the flower bed. We know the flower bed is 111 feet long, and that each plant is 12 inches wide.

Next, we need to calculate the price of each plant. Each plant is 12 inches wide, so each one takes up 1 foot of space. Since there are 74 plants, that means there will be 74 feet of plants in the flower bed. Each plant costs $6, so we need to multiply 74 by $6 to get the total price of the plants. That gives us $444. Finally, we need to add in the cost of the 17 flowers that Pat already owns. To do that, we just need to multiply 17 by $6. That gives us $102.
