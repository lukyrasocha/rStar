Since there are 74 plants, that means there will be 74 feet of plants in the flower bed. Each plant costs $6, so we need to multiply 74 by $6 to get the total price of the plants. That gives us $444. Finally, we need to add in the cost of the 17 flowers that Pat already owns. To do that, we just need to multiply 17 by $6. That gives us $102.
