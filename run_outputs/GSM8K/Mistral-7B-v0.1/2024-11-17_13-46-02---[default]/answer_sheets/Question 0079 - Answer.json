{"id": 1039, "problem": "Jim is making a comforter for his king-sized bed. He needs two pieces of fabric that are 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed, which measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. How many square feet of fabric does Jim need to buy?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "First find the length of each piece of fabric by adding 2 feet to the bed's length: 6 feet + 2 feet = <<6+2=8>>8 feet\nThen find the width of each piece of fabric by adding 2 feet to the bed's width: 8 feet + 2 feet = <<8+2=10>>10 feet\nThen find the square footage of each piece of fabric by multiplying its length and width: 8 feet * 10 feet = <<8*10=80>>80 square feet\nThen double that amount since Jim needs two pieces of fabric: 80 square feet/piece * 2 pieces = <<80*2=160>>160 square feet\n#### 160", "gold_answer": "160"}
