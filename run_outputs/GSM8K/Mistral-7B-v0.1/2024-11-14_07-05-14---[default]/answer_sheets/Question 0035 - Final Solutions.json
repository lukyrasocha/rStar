First, let's determine the total number of Grade 5 students. There are 200 Grade 5 students. Next, let's calculate the number of boys. We know that 2/5 of the students are boys. This means that 2/5 x 200 = 80 students are boys. Let's calculate the number of girls. Since we know the number of boys and the total number of students, we can subtract the number of boys from the total number of students to get the number of girls. So, 200 - 80 = 120 girls. Now, let's calculate the number of girls who are not in the girl scout. We know that 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout. This means that 2/3 x 120 = 80 girls are in the girl scout. So, there are 120 - 80 = 40 girls who are not in the girl scout.
