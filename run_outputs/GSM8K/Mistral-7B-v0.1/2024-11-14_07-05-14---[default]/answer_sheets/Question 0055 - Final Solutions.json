Question: How much profit would Sasha make if she sold all her leftover lumber?", "ost_step": {}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's think step by step. Condition 1 says 10 years ago, Sasha purchased 10 2x4x10 boards for $10 each and 5 4x4x10 boards for $16 each. The second condition says prices went up 50% since then. So she paid 10 * 10 = $100 for the 2x4x10 boards and 5 * 16 = $80 for the 4x4x10 boards. That is a total of $180. After prices went up 50%, the boards would cost $180 * 1.5 = $270. So she made $270 - 180 = $90. The answer is: 90.", "value": 0.15625}}}, "rollout_id": 4}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Given a list of conditions, please answer the question.
