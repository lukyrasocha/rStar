Therefore, Brooke's age is 1/2 * Seth's age.", "value": 0.2}, "ost_step": {}}, "2": {"subquestion": "Now we can answer the question: What is Seth's current age?", "subanswer": {"text": "Two years later, the sum of their ages will be 28. The sum of Brooke's and Seth's current ages is Brooke's age + Seth's age = 1/2 * Seth's age + Seth's age = 3/2 * Seth's age. Since it equals 28, we get that 3/2 * Seth's age = 28, meaning Seth's age = 28 * 2/3 = 28/3 years. The answer is 28/3.", "value": 0.2}, "ost_step": {}}}, "rollout_id": 15}]
