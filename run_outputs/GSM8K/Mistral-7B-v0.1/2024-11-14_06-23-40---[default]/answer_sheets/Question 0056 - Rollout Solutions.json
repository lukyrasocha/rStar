First, we need to know what the interest rate per month is. It is equal to 10% divided by 12, so it is 0.83%. Next, we need to calculate the monthly interest amount. We can do this by multiplying the balance by the interest rate. For instance, if the balance is 1000, then the monthly interest amount would be 1000 x 0.83%, which is 8.30. Finally, we can calculate the new balance after making each payment. To do this, we add the monthly interest amount to the previous balance and subtract the monthly payment. For example, if the previous balance was 1000, then the new balance after making the first payment would be 1000 + 8.30 - 165 = 856.70.
