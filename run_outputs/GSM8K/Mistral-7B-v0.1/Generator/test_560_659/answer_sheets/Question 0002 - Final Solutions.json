The problem states the sun is moving at 5 degrees an hour straight upward from the pyramid relative to Sahir's house. This means the rate of change in the angle of the sun is 5 degrees per hour. Now, calculate the change in the angle of the sun over time. The problem states the sun moves for 10 hours. To calculate the change in the angle of the sun, we multiply the rate of change (5 degrees per hour) by the time (10 hours). The change in the angle of the sun is therefore 50 degrees. Finally, add the starting angle of the sun (32 degrees) and the change in the angle of the sun (50 degrees). The final angle of the sun relative to the ground is 32 degrees + 50 degrees = 82 degrees.
