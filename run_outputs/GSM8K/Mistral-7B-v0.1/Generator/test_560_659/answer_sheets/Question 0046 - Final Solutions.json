Condition 3: Each tire has a maximum rotation count of 10,440,000 before needing replacement. Question: How long, in years, will it take before one of Jeremy's tires needs to be replaced based on his driving habits?", "ost_step": {}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's think step by step. Every two miles, tires rotate 725 times. 400 miles / 2 miles = 200. That means the tires would have rotated 200 * 725 = 145,000 times. Since we divide this by 10,440,000, that means it takes 10,440,000 / 145,000 = 72 years. The answer is: 72.", "value": 0.09375}}}, "rollout_id": 0}]
