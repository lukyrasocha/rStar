The air conditioner is on low for 3 hours, then on high for 4 hours, followed by being turned off for 2 hours. Let's calculate the net change in temperature for each part separately. During 3 hours on low, 2 * 3 = 6 degrees of cooling occurs. During 4 hours on high, 3 * 4 = 12 degrees of cooling occurs. And during 2 hours off, 2 * 2 = 4 degrees of warming occurs. The net change in temperature is therefore (6 + 12) - 4 = 14 degrees.
