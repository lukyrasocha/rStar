If the slice for an adult is twice as big as that for a kid, then there are 2 slices for adults and 4 slices for kids. 6 is made up of 2 adults and 4 kids, so it must also be made up of 2 slices for adults and 4 slices for kids. 6 can be written as 2a + 4k, which means that the percentage of each adult slice is 2/6 = 1/3, or 33%.
