We know that India has 4 more than half of the number of states in the US. So the number of states in India is 4 + half the number of states in the US. To find the number of states in the US, we need to find half of it. To find half of something, we can divide it by two. So, the number of states in India is 4 + (number of states in the US / 2). That means that the number of states in both countries together is 4 + (number of states in the US / 2) + number of states in the US.
