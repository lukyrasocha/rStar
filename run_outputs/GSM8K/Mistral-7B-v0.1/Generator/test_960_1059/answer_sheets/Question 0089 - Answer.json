{"id": 1049, "problem": "There are 50 books in a small library. Half of them are written in English, and 10% in German. All others are written in Spanish. How many Spanish books are there?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "Half of the books are in English, which means 50 * 0.5 = <<50*0.5=25>>25 books.\nGerman books make up to 10%, which means there are 10/100 * 50 = <<10/100*50=5>>5 of them.\nSo as a result there are 50 - 25 - 5 = <<50-25-5=20>>20 Spanish books in the library.\n#### 20", "gold_answer": "20"}
