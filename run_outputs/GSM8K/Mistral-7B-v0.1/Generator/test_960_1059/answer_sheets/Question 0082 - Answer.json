{"id": 1042, "problem": "Johnny's dad brought him to watch some horse racing and his dad bet money. On the first race, he lost $5. On the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. On the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. How much did he lose on average that day?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "On the second race he won $11 because 1+ 5 x 2 = <<1+5*2=11>>11\nOn the third race he lost $15 because 10 x 1.5 = <<10*1.5=15>>15\nHe lost a total of $20 on the first and third races because 15 + 5 = <<15+5=20>>20\n\nHe lost $9 that day because 11 - 20 = <<11-20=-9>>-9\nHe lost an average of $3 per race because 9 / 3 = <<9/3=3>>3\n#### 3", "gold_answer": "3"}
