{"id": 1044, "problem": "On the first day of school, Ava sees that her friends Cole and Xavier have both grown a lot over the summer. Xavier was 4 feet tall and grew 3 inches. Cole was 50 inches tall and grew 2 inches over the summer. What is the difference between Cole and Xavier\u2019s height now?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "First, we need to be sure we are comparing the same units, so let\u2019s convert feet into inches. There are 12 inches in 1 foot. So Xavier was 12 x 4 = <<12*4=48>>48 inches tall.\nXavier grew to be 48 + 3 = <<48+3=51>>51 inches.\nCole grew to be 50 + 2 = <<50+2=52>>52 inches.\nThe difference between Cole and Xavier\u2019s height is now 52 \u2013 51 = <<52-51=1>>1 inch.\n#### 1", "gold_answer": "1"}
