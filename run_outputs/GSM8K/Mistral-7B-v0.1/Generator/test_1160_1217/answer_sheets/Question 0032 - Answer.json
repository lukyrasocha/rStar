{"id": 1192, "problem": "Jen works for 7.5 hours a day 6 days a week. Her hourly rate is $1.5. Jen also receives an additional $10 if she has complete attendance. Suppose Jen did not incur any absences for  April, and there are exactly 4 weeks in April, how much will she receive?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "In a week, Jen works for 7.5 hours/day x 6 days = <<7.5*6=45>>45 hours/week\nSo in a month, she works for 45 hours/week x 4 weeks = <<45*4=180>>180 hours.\n180 hours of work is equal to 180 hours x $1.5 = $<<180*1.5=270>>270.\nSince she has complete attendance, she will receive a total of $270 + $10 = $<<270+10=280>>280.\n#### 280", "gold_answer": "280"}
