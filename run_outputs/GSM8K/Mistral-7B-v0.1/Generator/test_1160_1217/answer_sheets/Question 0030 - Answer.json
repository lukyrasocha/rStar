How many bandages did they start with on the first day?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "Let B be the number of bandages the nurses\u2019 station started with.\nOn the first day, they used 38 bandages and ordered 50, so they had B - 38 + 50 = B + 12 bandages left.\nOn the second day, they used 38 - 10 = <<38-10=28>>28 bandages.\nThus, at the end of the second day, they had B + 12 - 28 = B - 16 bandages left.\nOn the third day, they ordered 100 bandages and used half a pack, so they used 50 / 2 = 25.\nThus, on the third day, they had B - 16 + 100 - 25 = B + 59 bandages left.\nAt the end of the third day, they had 78 = B + 59 bandages left.\nThus, on the first day, they started with B = 78 - 59 = <<19=19>>19 bandages.\n#### 19", "gold_answer": "19"}
