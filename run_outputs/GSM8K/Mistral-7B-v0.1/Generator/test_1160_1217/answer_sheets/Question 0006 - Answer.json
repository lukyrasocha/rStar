{"id": 1166, "problem": "Generally, a 5-year-old avocado tree produces 50 fruits, a 6-year-old one produces 3 times the initial amount of fruits, a 7-year-old one produces 7 times the initial amount, and an 8-year-old produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old one. During the ninth year, the avocado tree doesn't produce any fruit, and then a 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount of fruits. How many total fruits can an avocado tree produce during its 10 years of life?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "At 5 years it produces 50 fruits\nAt 6 years it produces 50 * 3 = <<50*3=150>>150 fruits.\nAt 7 years, it produces 50 * 7 = <<50*7=350>>350 fruits\nAt 10 years, it produces 50 * 20 = <<50*20=1000>>1000 fruits\nAt 8 years, it produces 200 fewer fruits than at 10 years, so it produces 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits\nDuring 10 years, an avocado tree can produce a total of 50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 1000 = <<50+150+350+800+1000=2350>>2350 fruits\n#### 2350", "gold_answer": "2350"}
