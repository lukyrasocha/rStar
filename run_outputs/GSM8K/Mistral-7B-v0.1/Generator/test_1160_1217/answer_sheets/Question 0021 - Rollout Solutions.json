It says Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. This means that 1/3 of Wendy's age is Colin's age. So Colin's age is 1/3 of Wendy's age. Let's write an equation here: C / 3 = W. The problem also says Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. That means Colin will be 1/5 of Wendy's age seven years from now. So we can rewrite it to say 1/5 of Wendy's age seven years from now equals Colin's current age. Let's write an equation: (1/5 * W) + 7 = C. We can add 7 to both sides of this equation to simplify it: (1/5 * W) + 7 + (-7) = C + (-7). And then we can cancel out the 7's on both sides: (1/5 * W) = C + (-7) - (-7). Finally, we can subtract C from both sides to get rid of the variable on the right side: (1/5 * W) - C = 0. We can multiply everything by 5 and move C to the other side: 5(1/5 * W) - 5C = 0. And then we can do some algebra to simplify it further: W - 5C = 0. We can divide both sides by 5 to finish off our solution: (W - 5C) / 5 = 0 / 5.
