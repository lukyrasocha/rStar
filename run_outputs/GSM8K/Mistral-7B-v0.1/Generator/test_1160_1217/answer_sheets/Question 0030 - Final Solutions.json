They began with 38 bandages on the first day. 10 fewer bandages were used on the second day, so 38 - 10 = 28 were left on the second day. For the third day, 2 packs with 100 bandages were ordered, but only half was used. This is 100 / 2 = 50 bandages used. Therefore, 100 - 50 = 50 bandages were left over at the end of the third day. These 50 bandages plus 28 bandages (from the second day) leaves 78 bandages altogether. So they began with 38 bandages on the first day.
