{"id": 1209, "problem": "Brian's basement was damp and musty, so he bought a dehumidifier to remove moisture out of the air.  The device has three speeds: low, medium, and high.   Brian tested the device's efficiency and he found that the low setting removes 1 liter of water out of the air per day, the medium setting removes twice as much water per day as the low setting, and the high setting removes twice as much water per day as the medium setting.  If Brian ran the dehumidifier for 3 days on the low setting, then an additional 3 days on the medium setting, and then an additional 5 days on the high setting, what is the total amount of water that the dehumidifier removed from the air in his basement, in liters?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "The medium setting removes twice as much water per day as the low setting, for a total of 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 liters of water per day.\nThe high setting removes twice as much water per day as the medium setting, for a total of 2*2=<<2*2=4>>4 liters of water per day.\n3 days on the low setting removes 3*1=<<3*1=3>>3 liters of water.\n3 days on the medium setting removes 3*2=<<3*2=6>>6 liters of water.\nAnd 5 days on the high setting removes 5*4=<<5*4=20>>20 liters of water.\nIn total, the dehumidifier removed 3+6+20=<<3+6+20=29>>29 liters of water from the air in his basement.\n#### 29", "gold_answer": "29"}
