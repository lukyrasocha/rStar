In a two week period, Jason emptied the dishwasher 6 times, did his laundry once, took the trash out twice and cleaned his room once.  How much money did Jason earn?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "Jason emptied the dishwasher 6 times at $0.50 each so he made 6*.50=$<<6*.50=3.00>>3.00\nJason did his laundry 1 time at $3.00 so he made 1*3 = $<<1*3=3.00>>3.00\nJason took the trash out 2 times at $0.75 each so he made 2*.75 = $<<2*.75=1.50>>1.50\nJason cleaned his room 1 time at $1.50 each so he made 1*1.50 = $<<1*1.50=1.50>>1.50\nJason made 3+1.50+1.50+3 = $<<3+1.5+1.5+3=9.00>>9.00\n#### 9", "gold_answer": "9"}
