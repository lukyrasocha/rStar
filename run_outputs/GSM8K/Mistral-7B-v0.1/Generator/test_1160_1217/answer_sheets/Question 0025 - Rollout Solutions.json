Each friend eats 6 slices of cheese pizza and 4 slices of pepperoni pizza. So they will each take 6 + 4 = 10 slices of pizza. 6 friends would need 6 * 10 = 60 slices of pizza. Since the cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices each, it will have 12 / 10 = 1.2 pizza pies. Since the pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices each, it will have 8 / 10 = 0.8 pizza pies. So 1.2 + 0.8 = 2 pizza pies are needed.
