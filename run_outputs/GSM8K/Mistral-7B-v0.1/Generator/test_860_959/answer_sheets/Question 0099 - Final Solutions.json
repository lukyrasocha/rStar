Coach brought a single bag with basketballs to practice and emptied all of the balls onto the gym floor.

Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey. Jason picked up and transported only two balls. Therefore, the total number of balls at the end of the practice is (Jordan + Jason + Jeffrey) * 3 = 3x + 3y + 3z. 3x + 3y + 3z = 3(x + y + z). Since Jason picked up and transported only two balls, we know that y = 2. Therefore, 3x + 6 + 3z = 3(x + y + z), or 3x + 3z = x + y + z + 2. Subtracting x from both sides yields 2x + 3z = y + 2. But we know y = 2, so 2x + 3z = 2 + 2. Solving for z yields z = 1. Thus, the total number of basketballs that Coach brought to the practice is 3x + 3y + 3z = 3x + 3*2 + 3*1 = 3x + 6 + 3 = 3x + 9.
