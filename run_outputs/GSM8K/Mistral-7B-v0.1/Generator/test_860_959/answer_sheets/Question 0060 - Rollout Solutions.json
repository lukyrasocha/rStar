So 3 * 3 = 9 dogs. There are 2 fewer rabbits than dogs. So 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits. Then we need to know the number of fish Larry has. It is 3 times the number of rabbits. So 3 * 7 = 21 fish. Larry has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has. That means 1/3 of 21, which is 7 gerbils. All together Larry has 3 + 9 + 7 + 21 + 7 = 47 pets.
