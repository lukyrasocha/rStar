There are some gold coins and some silver coins. We know that there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins. Let's call the number of gold coins g. Since there are 30 more gold coins, we have g + 30 = silver coins. g + 30 + g = silver coins + gold coins. Since this is the total number of coins, this is also 30. That means g + 2g = 30. 3g = 30. g = 10.
