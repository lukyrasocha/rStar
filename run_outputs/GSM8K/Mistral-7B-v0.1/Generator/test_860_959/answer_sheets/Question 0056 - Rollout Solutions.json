Question: How much money did Julia and Nadine's mother give them before they began shopping?", "ost_step": {"1": "Use condition 1 to identify the amount of money Julia and Nadine received from their mother. Since they receive the same amount of allowance, let's call it X dollars."}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's think step by step. We know that Julia and Nadine received the same amount of allowance from their mother. Let's call this amount X dollars. With X dollars, they bought a cake for $11, a dozen balloons at $0.5 per set, and two tubs of ice cream for $7 each. This leaves us with the following equation: X - (11 + (12 * 0.5) + (2 * 7)) = 0. To solve for X, we can rearrange the equation like so: X = (11 + (12 * 0.5) + (2 * 7)). Plugging in the values, we get X = (11 + (12 * 0.5) + (2 * 7)) = (11 + 6 + 14) = 31. Therefore, Julia and Nadine's mother gave them 31 dollars before they began shopping.
