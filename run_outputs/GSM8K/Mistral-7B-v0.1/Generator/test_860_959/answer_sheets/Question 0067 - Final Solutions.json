First we need to find out how many mini cinnamon rolls and mini blueberry muffins were baked. There were 200 mini cinnamon rolls and 300 mini blueberry muffins. To solve this question, we need to know how many calories these pastries have. Normal cinnamon rolls have 600 calories, so mini ones would have 1/3rd of that, or 200 calories. Similarly, normal blueberry muffins have 450 calories, so mini ones would have 1/3rd of that, or 150 calories.
