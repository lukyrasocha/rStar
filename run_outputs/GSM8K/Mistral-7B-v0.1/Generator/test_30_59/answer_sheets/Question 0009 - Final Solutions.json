But she can skip at a rate of speed which is half as fast as she can run. If she can skip at 3 miles per hour, how many miles can she travel in six hours if she spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking?\n\nFirst, let's find her walking speed. Since she can skip at half the speed she runs, we can divide her skipping speed by two to get her walking speed. Three miles per hour divided by two equals 1.5 miles per hour.\n\nNext, find her running speed. Since she can run four times faster than she walks, we can multiply her walking speed by four to get her running speed. One point five miles per hour multiplied by four equals six miles per hour.\n\nNow, calculate how much time Dana spends running and walking. We know she spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. Therefore, she spends three hours running and six hours walking.\n\nTo get the distance traveled by Dana, we need to add the distances traveled during the running and walking periods.\n\nWe know that the distance traveled during the running period is six miles per hour multiplied by three hours, which equals 18 miles.\n\nSimilarly, the distance traveled during the walking period is 1.5 miles per hour multiplied by six hours, which equals 9 miles.\n\nAdding these distances gives us the total distance traveled by Dana, which is 18 miles plus 9 miles, which equals 27 miles.\n\nIn conclusion, the correct answer is 27.", "value": 0.1875}}}, "rollout_id": 11}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Dana can run at a rate of speed four times faster than she can walk, but she can skip at a rate of speed that is half as fast as she can run.

That means she can run 4X * 6 = 24X miles in 6 hours. She also skips at a speed of X/2, so she can skip X/2 * 6 = 3X miles in 6 hours. So the total distance traveled is 24X + 3X = 27X miles.\n\nIn order to determine how long she spends running and how long she spends walking, we need to find out what fraction of the total time she spends running. Since she spends 1/3 of the time running, that means she spends 1/3 * 6 = 2 hours running, and therefore spends 4 hours walking (since the total time is 6 hours). Therefore, the total distance she travels while running is 4X miles, and the total distance she travels while walking is 24X - 4X = 20X miles.\n\nSo, the answer to the question is: How many miles will Dana travel in six hours, given that she spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking?
