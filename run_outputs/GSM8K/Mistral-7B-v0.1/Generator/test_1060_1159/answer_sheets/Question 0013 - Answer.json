{"id": 1073, "problem": "Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas, which is enough to feed his three monkeys for a week. One monkey eats 10 bananas each day. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey and the third monkey eats the rest of the bananas for the day.  How many bananas does the third monkey eat each day?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "Each day, the three monkeys eat a total of 315/7 = <<315/7=45>>45 bananas.\nThe second monkey eats 10 + 4 = <<10+4=14>>14 bananas a day.\nSo the first and the second monkey eat a total of 10 + 14 = <<10+14=24>>24 bananas each day.\nHence, the third monkey eats 45 - 24 = <<45-24=21>>21 bananas each day.\n#### 21", "gold_answer": "21"}
