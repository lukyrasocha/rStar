The first mug was 33 degrees and the second mug was an unknown temperature. Let's call the unknown temperature T. Thus, the temperature difference is T - 33 degrees. Third, we need to calculate the change in temperature due to mixing the water. We poured 5 ounces of water from both bottles. Since each mug contains 12 ounces of water, we reduced the volume of water in each mug by half. This means that each mug had a change in temperature of 5 / 12 = 1/4 degrees. Finally, we need to add the temperature difference to the change in temperature. The change in temperature is 1/4 degrees. We add that to the temperature difference of T - 33 degrees. Therefore, the final temperature is T - 33 + 1/4 degrees. That is, the temperature of the second bottle is T - 33 + 1/4 degrees.
