From condition 3 we know that Ned is two feet shorter than his cousin, Isabel. Let's call the height of Isabel i. Then, because Ned is two feet shorter than Isabel, we can say that n = i - 2. Finally, from condition 4 we know that Isabel is 7 feet tall. So, substituting these values into our equations, we get that c = h / 2 = (n + 1) / 2 = (i - 2 + 1) / 2 = (i - 1) / 2 = (7 - 1) / 2 = 6 / 2 = 3.
