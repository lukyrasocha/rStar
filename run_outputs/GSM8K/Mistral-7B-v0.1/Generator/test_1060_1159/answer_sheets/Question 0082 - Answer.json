{"id": 1142, "problem": "Jess is trying to guess the number of blue jellybeans in a jar. She can see that there are 17 green jelly beans and twice as many red jelly beans. The rest of the jellybeans are blue jelly beans. If there are a total of 60 jelly beans in total, how many blue jellybeans are there?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "There are 17 green jelly beans * 2 = <<17*2=34>>34 red jelly beans.\nSo in the green and red jelly beans, there are a total of 17 + 34 = <<17+34=51>>51 jellybeans.\nAs the rest are blue, there must be 60 total jellybeans \u2013 51 red and green jelly beans = <<60-51=9>>9 blue jelly beans.\n#### 9", "gold_answer": "9"}
