{"id": 1145, "problem": "Faraday owns a flower shop. He sells a sunflower that costs $2 each and a bouquet of sunflower that costs $8. If Faraday earned $26 from the sunflower and $56 from the bouquet per day, and if each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, how many sunflowers was Faraday able to sell after 3 days?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "Faraday sold $56 / $8 = <<56/8=7>>7 bouquets of sunflower.\nSo he was able to sell a total of 12 x 7 = <<12*7=84>>84 sunflowers from the bouquets.\nAnd he was able to sell a total of $26/$2= <<26/2=13>>13 Sunflowers.\nThe sum of sunflowers Faraday was able to sell is 84 + 13 = <<84+13=97>>97.\nTherefore, the total of sunflowers he sold after 3 days is 97 x 3 = <<97*3=291>>291.\n#### 291", "gold_answer": "291"}
