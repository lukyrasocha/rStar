{"id": 1079, "problem": "A $2000 watch was put on sale so that Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of its original price. He then sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price that he bought it. What is the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Roger's friend from the original price?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "Mr. Roger bought the perfume at $2000 x 75/100 = $<<2000*75/100=1500>>1500.\nHe then sold it to his friend at $1500 x 120/100 = $<<1500*120/100=1800>>1800\nSo, Mr. Roger's friend paid $2000 - $1800 = $<<2000-1800=200>>200 less than the original price.\nSo, his friend got $200/$2000 x 100% = <<200/2000*100=10>>10% discount.\n#### 10", "gold_answer": "10"}
