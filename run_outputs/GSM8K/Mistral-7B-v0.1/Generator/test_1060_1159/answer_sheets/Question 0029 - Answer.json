{"id": 1089, "problem": "Nathan has a bouncy ball that bounces to 2/3rds of its starting height with each bounce. If he drops it from the third-floor balcony in the mall, where each story is 24 feet high, how high does the ball go on its second bounce?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "First find the total height from which Nathan drops the ball: 24 feet/story * 3 stories = <<24*3=72>>72 feet\nThen multiply that number by 2/3rds to find the height of the ball after one bounce: 72 feet * 2/3 = <<72*2/3=48>>48 feet\nThen multiply that number by 2/3rds to find the height of the ball after two bounces: 48 feet * 2/3 = <<48*2/3=32>>32 feet\n#### 32", "gold_answer": "32"}
