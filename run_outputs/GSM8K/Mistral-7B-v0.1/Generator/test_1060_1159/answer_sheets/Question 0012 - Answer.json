{"id": 1072, "problem": "Maggie spent a quarter of her money, while Riza spent one-third of her money. They each had $60. How much money do the two of them have left?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "Maggie spent $60/4 = $<<60/4=15>>15.\nSo, Maggie is left with $60 - $15 = $<<60-15=45>>45.\nRiza spent $60/3 = $<<60/3=20>>20.\nSo, Riza is left with $60 - $20 = $<<60-20=40>>40.\nThus, they have a total of $45 + $40 = $<<45+40=85>>85 left.\n#### 85", "gold_answer": "85"}
