Originally, Mike was penpals with 5 people. But he stopped being penpals with 2 people. So he has 5 - 2 = 3 people remaining. Each of these people sends him 2 letters a week which is 6 pages. Since he replies in kind, he also receives 6 pages a week. It takes him 6 minutes to write a page. So it takes 6 minutes x 6 pages = 36 minutes per letter.
