The total number of animal legs is 70, but we don't know how many of those legs belong to sheep or goats. Let's start by assuming that all the legs belong to goats. We can then solve for the number of goats using the formula Legs(goats) = Head(goats)*4. This means that there would be 20*4 = 80 goat legs.
