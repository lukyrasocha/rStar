According to the first condition, at the start of the week, Carol had 20 autographs, and Jennifer had 44 autographs. Since there are 3 weeks remaining until their vacation ends, and the sisters want to have 100 autographs altogether, we can calculate the number of autographs that they need to get each week as follows: (100 - 20) / 3 = 26. Therefore, the sisters need to collect 26 autographs per week in order to reach their goal.\n\nHint: You can also use algebra to solve this problem. Since the sisters want to accumulate 100 autographs by the end of the third week, they will need to collect an additional 100 - 20 autographs over the course of those three weeks.
