First, let's find out how many lines there are in the solo song. The solo song has 54 lines. Next, let's figure out how many lines there are in the first scene. The first scene has twice as many lines, but only a third of them are his lines. That means the total lines in the first scene would be (lines he needs to memorize) * 2 / 3 = (x) * 2 / 3. We can substitute this expression into our original equation above and solve for x. The equation becomes 2/3 * x * 2 / 3 = 54. Simplifying, we get 2 * x * 2 = 54.

Next, let's find out how many lines there are in the second scene. The second scene has six more lines than the song, and four-fifths of them are his. That means the total lines in the second scene would be (six more lines than the song) * 4/5 = (x) * 4/5. We can substitute this expression into our original equation above and solve for x. The equation becomes (x) * 4/5 + (27) * 4/5 = 54. Simplifying, we get 4 * x + 108 = 54 * 4. Solving for x, we get 4 * x = 54 * 4 - 108 = 216 - 108 = 108. Divide both sides by 4, we get x = 108 / 4 = 27. So there are 27 lines he has to memorize for the second scene.
