The weight of the red bird is also known to be 20 pounds more than the pink frog, so it weighs 50 + 20 = 70 pounds. The blue beetle weighs the same as the pink frog, so it weighs 50 pounds. Finally, the green toad weighs the same as the blue beetle, so it also weighs 50 pounds. Let's add all these weights together to get the weight of the container and the animals within it: 40 + 70 + 50 + 50 = 210 pounds.

To find the weight of the yellow snake, we look at condition 1 and use the information that the yellow snake weighs 10 pounds less than the pink frog. We can find the weight of the yellow snake by subtracting 10 pounds from the weight of the pink frog, so we get 50 - 10 = 40. To find the weight of the green toad, we look at condition 1 again and use the information that the green toad weighs the same as the yellow snake. Since we already know the weight of the yellow snake, we can just use that value here. So the weight of the green toad is 40. To find the weight of the red bird, we look at condition 1 again and use the information that the red bird weighs 20 pounds more than the green toad. Again, since we already know the weight of the green toad, we can just add 20 pounds to that value. So the weight of the red bird is 40 + 20 = 60.
