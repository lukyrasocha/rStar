The ratio of junior programmers to total employees is 2:5. This means that there are 2 junior programmers for every 5 total employees.

Condition 2 states that senior programmers earn $400 more than junior programmers, so we can calculate the total amount earned by the senior programmers as (100 - 20) * 400 + 40000 = 160000.
