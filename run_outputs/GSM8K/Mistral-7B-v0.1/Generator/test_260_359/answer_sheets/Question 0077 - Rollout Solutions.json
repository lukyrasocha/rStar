So, Thomas ate 3 x 2 = 6 hot dogs.", "3": "Identify the number of hot dogs John ate. The problem states John ate half the amount Thomas ate. So, John ate 1/2 x 6 = 3 hot dogs.", "4": "Subtract the number of hot dogs Luke ate from the number of hot dogs John ate. Luke ate 2 hot dogs and John ate 3 hot dogs. So, John ate 3 - 2 = 1 more hot dog than Luke.", "5": "The answer is 1."}}}, "rollout_id": 31}]
