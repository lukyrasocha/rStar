One quarter of the seniors are officers who receive $12 cords. To answer the question, we need to calculate the cost of the pins. Firstly, let's calculate the total number of seniors who received a pin. Since there are two seniors who received a pin, the total number is 44 - 2 = 42. Next, we can calculate the cost of the pins by multiplying the total number of seniors who received a pin (42) by the cost of each pin ($5). Therefore, the cost of the pins is 42 * 5 = 210.
