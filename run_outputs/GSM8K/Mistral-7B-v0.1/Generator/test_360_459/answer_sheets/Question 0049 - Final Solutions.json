We start with 40 employees hired in may earning $15 per hour for 40 hours a week. This means we have 40 employees making 15*40=$600 per week. The problem says that in june, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expire. So we lose 10 employees (or 1/4 of 40). This means our total compensation paid by the company is $600*30+$600*10=$18000.

Each employee works for 40 hours a week, so that is 40 x 40 = 1600 hours total for all the employees in May. Second, we need to calculate the total pay in May. Each employee earns $15 per hour, so the total pay is 1600 * 15 = $24000. Third, in June, 1/4 (or 25%) of the employees' contracts expire. That means 40 * 25% = 10 employees will not be working for the company anymore. Fourth, we need to calculate the total hours worked by all the remaining employees in June. Each employee works for 40 hours a week, so that is 40 * 30 = 1200 hours total for the remaining employees in June. Fifth, we need to calculate the total pay in June. Each employee still earns $15 per hour, so the total pay is 1200 * 15 = $18000.
