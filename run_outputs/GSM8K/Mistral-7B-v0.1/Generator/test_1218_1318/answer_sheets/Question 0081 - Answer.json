{"id": 1299, "problem": "Janet goes to the mall and spends $3.50 on ice cream, $7.50 each for movie tickets for herself and her younger sister, and $8.50 on a bracelet. If her parents gave her $40, how many dollars does she have left?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "First calculate the cost of the movie tickets by multiplying the price per ticket by 2: $7.50 * 2 = $<<7.5*2=15.00>>15.00\nThen add up all the money Janet spent: $3.50 + $15.00 + $8.50 = $<<3.5+15+8.5=27.00>>27.00\nNow subtract Janet's spending from the initial amount of money she had: $40.00 - $27.00 = $<<40-27=13.00>>13.00\n#### 13", "gold_answer": "13"}
