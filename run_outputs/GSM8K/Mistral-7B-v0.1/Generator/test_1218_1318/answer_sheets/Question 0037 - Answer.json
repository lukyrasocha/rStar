{"id": 1255, "problem": "Crista's plants need to be watered every day. She has 20 plants. 4 of her plants need half of a cup of water. 8 plants need 1 cup of water. The rest need a quarter of a cup of water. How many cups of water does Crista need every day for her plants?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "She will need 2 cups for the plants that need half of a cup of water because .5*4 = 2 cups\nShe will need 8 cups for the plants that need a cup of water because 1*8= <<1*8=8>>8 cups.\nSince she has 20 plants, 20-4-8=<<20-4-8=8>>8 plants that need a quarter of a cup of water.\nSince 8 plants need a quarter of a cup of water, she will need 2 cups of water for these plants because .25*8=<<.25*8=2>>2 cups.\nIn total, she will need 2+8+2=<<2+8+2=12>>12 cups of water per day.\n#### 12", "gold_answer": "12"}
