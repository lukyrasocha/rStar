{"id": 1281, "problem": "Dexter has five pigs. Each one eats 4 pounds of feed, twice a day. If Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed, how many pounds of feed is left after a week?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "In a day, one pig consumes 4 x 2 = <<4*2=8>>8 pounds of feed.\nIn a day, five pigs consume 8 x 5 = <<8*5=40>>40 pounds.\nIn a week, five pigs consume 40 x 7 = <<40*7=280>>280 pounds.\nSo, there are 300 - 280 = <<300-280=20>>20 pounds of feed left.\n#### 20", "gold_answer": "20"}
