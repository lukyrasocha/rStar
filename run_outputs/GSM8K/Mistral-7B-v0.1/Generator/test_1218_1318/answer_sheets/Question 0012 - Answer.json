His standard fee is $80 per hour for lessons, but he reduces his rate by 25% when he is giving lessons to a veteran.   If today Charlie has 4 1-hour lessons at his standard rate and 2 1-hour lessons with a veteran, what is the total amount of money he will make for the day, in dollars?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "4 1-hour lessons at his standard rate cost 4*$80=$<<4*80=320>>320.\nReducing the rate by 25% for veterans means he takes $80/4=$<<80/4=20>>20 off his standard fee.\nThus, for veterans, he charges the reduced rate of $80-$20=$<<80-20=60>>60 per hour,\nThus, 2 1-hour lessons with veterans cost 2*$60=$<<2*60=120>>120.\nAll together, Charlie will make $320+$120=$<<320+120=440>>440 for the day.\n#### 440", "gold_answer": "440"}
