It also takes 2 pounds of special honey.  The passion fruit costs $6 per pound, the jackfruit is $8 per pound, and the honey is $10 per pound.  He sells each jar for $50.  How much profit does he make selling 10 jars?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "The cost of the passion fruit is 2*6=$<<2*6=12>>12\nThe jackfruit cost 1.5*8=$<<1.5*8=12>>12\nThe honey is 2*10=$<<2*10=20>>20\nSo the total cost for a jar is 12+12+20=$<<12+12+20=44>>44\nSo the profit per jar is 50-44=$<<50-44=6>>6\nSo the total profit for 10 jars is 10*6=$<<10*6=60>>60\n#### 60", "gold_answer": "60"}
