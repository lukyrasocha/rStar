{"id": 1220, "problem": "Ian has a board that is 40 feet long. He decides to make a cut so he can have two pieces. The longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece. How long is the longer piece?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "Let x be the length of the shorter piece.\nThe two pieces are 4x and x in length.\nThe equation is 4x + x = 40 when the lengths of the two boards are added.\nAdding like terms makes the equation 5x = 40.\nThen dividing 40 by 5 gives the value of x which is <<40/5=8>>8.\nSince x =8, the longer piece is 4*8 = 32.\n#### 32", "gold_answer": "32"}
