We have 20 helmets. We know there are half as many robots as helmets and half as many helmets as footballs. Since there are half as many robots as helmets, if there are 20 helmets, there must be 40 robots. Half as many helmets as footballs means there are 40 footballs. 40 + 40 + 20 is 100. The answer is: 100.", "value": 0.3125}}}, "rollout_id": 30}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Given a list of conditions, please answer the question. Condition 1: 50% as many robots as helmets.
