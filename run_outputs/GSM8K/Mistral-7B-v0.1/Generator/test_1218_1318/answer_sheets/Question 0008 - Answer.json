{"id": 1226, "problem": "A basic manicure starts at $35 while a pedicure starts at $40. A certain salon offers 20% off if you get both. Suppose Karen chooses to do both and would also like to add nail art on each of her fingers, which costs $3 per nail. How much would she pay in all?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "The cost for both manicure and pedicure is $35+$40=$<<35+40=75>>75.\nThe discount is $75*0.2=$<<75*0.2=15>>15.\nSo, Karen would only pay $75-$15=$<<75-15=60>>60 for both services.\nThe cost of the nail art for 10 fingers is $3*$10=$<<3*10=30>>30.\nTherefore, Karen would pay a total of $60+$30=$<<60+30=90>>90.\n#### 90", "gold_answer": "90"}
