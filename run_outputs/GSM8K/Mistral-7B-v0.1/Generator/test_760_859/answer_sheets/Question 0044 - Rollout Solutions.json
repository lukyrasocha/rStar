When the second car passed the first car, the two cars were right next to each other, so the distance was zero.", "2": "Identify the time for both cars to cover the initial distance. Since we know that both cars travel at the same speed, we can calculate the time using the formula: time = distance / speed. For the first car, this becomes: time = 0 (distance) / 60 (speed) = 0 hours. For the second car, this becomes: time = 0 (distance) / 70 (speed) = 0 hours. Therefore, both cars took 0 hours to cover the initial distance.", "3": "Calculate the distance traveled by both cars during the 2 hours. We know that both cars travel at the same speed, so the distance covered by each car during the 2 hours is equal. This means that the distance traveled by both cars during the 2 hours is twice the speed of either car multiplied by the time (2 hours).
