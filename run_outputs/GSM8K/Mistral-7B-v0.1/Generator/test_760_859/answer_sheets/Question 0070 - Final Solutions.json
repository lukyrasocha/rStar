First, we need to calculate how many days there are in one month. There are 4 weeks in one month. Each week has 7 days. So there are 4*7=28 days in one month. Next, let's calculate how much time Britany spends on TikTok per week. She records 18 4-minute TikTok videos each week, so she spends 18*4=72 minutes recording. She also writes amateur songs for 2 hours per week, and spends 15 minutes six days a week doing her makeup. In total, she spends 2*7+15*6=80 minutes per week doing these activities. Finally, we multiply the amount of time spent on TikTok per week by the number of weeks in a month to get the total amount of time Britany spends on TikTok in one month. So, Britany spends (72+80)*4=544 minutes on TikTok in one month. Converting minutes into hours, Britany spends 544/60=9.06667 hours on TikTok in one month.
