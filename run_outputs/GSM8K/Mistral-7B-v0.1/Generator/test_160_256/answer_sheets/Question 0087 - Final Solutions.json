We know that she spent $12 on ingredients for her sister's birthday cake, $43 on gifts, $15 on decorations, $4 on invitations, and $22 on goodie bags for party guests. That is a total of $12 + $43 + $15 + $4 + $22 = $96. Because she divided the costs equally between herself and her two parents, she would have spent half of it, which is $96 / 3 = $32. As such, Isabelle spent $32 on decorations.
