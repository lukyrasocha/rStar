It also tells us directly via wording like \u201che\u2026stopped...for about half an hour\u201d.

From this analysis we identify: Firstly, Henry makes one break at mile marker 20; Secondly, another rest happens when Henry covers 15 fewer miles than remaining till completion (This implies subtracting those extra 15 miles from remainder). By summing up both distances traveled till breaks(first=20) & towards last breaking point i.e., starting from zero til it reaches destination less 15,(60-(60-20)=(-40)) ,he could find out 'distance_covered'. Perform such calculation which comes as (initial_break+(remaining--extra)), or simplified form (d1+r), thus getting overall computation result((20)+(-40)). This yields -(20). While not being plausible due to negative numbers suggesting no forward progression beyond initial halt so correct interpretation would mean calculating only positive aspect/segment leading back toward original endpoint .
