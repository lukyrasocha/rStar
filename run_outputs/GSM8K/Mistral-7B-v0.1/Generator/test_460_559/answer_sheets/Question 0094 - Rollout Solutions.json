Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long when the water is warm. Let's calculate how much time it takes him to swim 3 miles when the water is warm. Since he swims 2 minutes longer for every mile, we can calculate the total time by adding 2 minutes to the original 16 three times. This results in 16 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 22 minutes.
