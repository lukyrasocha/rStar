We know that there are equal numbers of boys and girls, so let's call the number of boys b, and the number of girls g.

Subtracting 4b from both sides gives us g = b. So, the number of girls is the same as the number of boys. Next, let's look at condition 1. It says that there are 20 students going on a school trip. This means that the total number of students is 20. Adding up the number of boys and the number of girls, we get 20 = b + g. Since we found earlier that g = b, this becomes 20 = b + b, which simplifies to 20 = 2b. Dividing both sides by 2 gives us 10 = b. So the number of boys is 10. Finally, since the number of shells that the boys collected is x, and the number of shells that the girls collected is the same as the boys, plus four times the number of shells that the boys collected, it follows that g = x + 4x, or x + 4x = g, which simplifies to 5x = g.
