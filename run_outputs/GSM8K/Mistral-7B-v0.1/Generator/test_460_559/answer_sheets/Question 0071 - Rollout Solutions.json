Initially, 48 people were in the bus. At the first stop, 8 people got off. The number of passengers that went into the bus is 5 times more than those getting out.

The number of people that came into the bus was 3 less than 3 times the number of passengers that got off. Let's substitute in the numbers we know. It'll be (3*21) - 3.
