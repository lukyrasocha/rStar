We want to figure out how many sofas and chairs in total do Ophelia and Jenna have. Let's start by figuring out how many chairs Ophelia has. Since Ophelia has 20 sofas, we can multiply that by 3 (since Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia) to get the number of chairs that Jenna has. That means Ophelia has 20 fewer chairs than Jenna. That also means that Ophelia and Jenna together have 20 fewer chairs than Jenna alone. Therefore, the total number of chairs for Ophelia and Jenna is 20 fewer than the number of chairs that Jenna has. So Ophelia and Jenna have a total of 20 fewer chairs than Jenna alone. The total number of chairs that Jenna has is 20 + 20 = 40. Finally, since Ophelia has 20 sofas, and each person has the same number of chairs as sofas, Ophelia and Jenna have a total of 20 sofas.
