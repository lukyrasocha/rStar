Initially, 48 people were in the bus. At the first stop, 8 people got off. The number of passengers that went into the bus is 5 times more than those getting out. That means there were 5x8 = 40 passengers going into the bus. So there were 48 - 8 - 40 = 20 passengers in the bus. At the second stop, 21 people got off. The number of people that came into the bus was 3 less than 3 times the number of passengers that got off. Let's substitute in the numbers we know. It'll be (3*21) - 3. We can simplify this to 3x21 - 3 which is 63 - 3 which is 60. So 60 people entered the bus. Thus, 20 - 60 = -40. Since no one can have a negative amount of passengers, we'll say that 0 people were in the bus.
