The problem states Kevin travels at an average speed of 47 km/hr. The problem also states he traveled for 2 days. So, we need to convert hours to seconds using the conversion factor of 3600 seconds per hour. Therefore, we know it took him (2 days x 24 hours per day) x (60 minutes per hour) x (60 seconds per minute) = 172,800 seconds to complete his journey. Next, we need to calculate the percentage of the total distance that Kevin has traveled by dividing the distance he traveled by the total distance and multiplying by 100%. We can calculate the distance Kevin traveled using the formula: Distance = Speed * Time. So, the distance Kevin traveled is 47 km/hr x 172,800 seconds = 8068.8 km. Therefore, the percentage of the total distance that Kevin has traveled is: (8068.8 km / 4700 km) x 100% = 171.4% of the total distance.
