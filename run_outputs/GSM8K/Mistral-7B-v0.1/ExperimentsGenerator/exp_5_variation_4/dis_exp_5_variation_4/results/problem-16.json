To determine what portion of goods weren\u2019t usable or unsellable as indicated within our prompt; let n=total units(purchased)-the fractional value representing these undesirable products i.e., UnitsUnusable=(TotalInitialQuantity)*(FractionDenotingUnsaleability). With TotalInitialQuantity being determined previously (4000), plugging values we find UnusableQuantity=((n)/n)=[(4000gallons*)(2/5)] which simplifies to [(800 Gallons]which equals 1600units worth of product deemed unfit for sale owing to them reaching beyond specified freshness duration .

We note right here however, that we still need information about what portion(amount)of their original purchase remained usable / sale ready upon return due to spoilage or otherwise unfitness for consumption; which segment remains fit & sellable if indeed any existent before being shipped back .

        " = $14,000 spent initially. Determine the portion of the milk which spoiled based off percentages provided. According to the question, 2/5th or 40% (since percentage values usually require converting fractions into decimals before performing calculations) of the milk received turned bad and hence couldn\u2019t contribute towards earnings when resold, leaving only 60%. Compute what proportion of original quantity this represents considering no extra purchases made during transit times. Remembering that proportions can be calculated using ratios such as parts over wholes multiply them together \u2013 thus here we need multiplying our value representing unsellable part i.e., .40 / whole , with being 'whole', equals .40 X 4000; leading us directly to figure about quantifiable loss due inglorious bacterial infestation within uncooked sustenance containers receiving backhand returns without any additional fees charged against remunerations exchanged posthaste via corporative intermediary transactions conducted amidst usual business dealings entailingly standardized procedures adherent throughout marketplace trade customary economic dynamics prevailing contemporarily widespread practice across diverse commerce sectors underpinning modern civilizational constructive endeavours globally recognised institutional benchmark protocol governing societal conduct ubiquitous observances universally codified tenets established thereby inherently presupposing uniformity amongst human collectives whilst abiding statutorily stipulated normatives encapsulating mutually agreed terms binding parties contractual obligations implicated vis-\u00e0-vis delineated financial exchange specificities ensuring equitable distribution fairness alignments commensurately adjudicated compensatory recompense congruency rectifications justifiably warranting pecuniary credits recourse restitution redressement enforcement mechanisms contrived effectuating balancing retributive punitive consequences preclusively prohibiting discriminatory exploitations circumvent counterproductive aggrandizements consequential ramifications adversely impacting public health safety standards protection rights vindicating individual liberties safeguarding communal wellbeing facilitators promoting harmony cooperative spirit fostering unity fraternization cohabitation reciprocity synergistic solidarity amplifying productivity efficacy optimizing operability competencies maximizing proficiency leveraging specializations expertise skills talent"
