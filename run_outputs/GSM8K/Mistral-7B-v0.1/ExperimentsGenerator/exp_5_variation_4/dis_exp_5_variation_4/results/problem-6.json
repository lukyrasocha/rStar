        " the hat and jacket. Let's first determine the price of the jacket; since it costs three times (3x) what you pay for a hat ($25), we can calculate this by multiplying these values together\u2014this yields 75 dollar amount which represents the value obtained when you multiply the variable 'Hat_price', representing the price of one hat, by its coefficient 'Jackets_Price'. Thus using our equation below Hat_price * Jackets_Price= 25*3=$<<25*3=75>>75 We next find out the unit/cost of the overalls or trousers i.e., Pants Price, following standard mathematical convention we take mean(average): Since both items involved \u2013the cost of hats and coats\u2013are similar units expressed numerically we use arithmetic operations like addition within parentheses before multiplication ,so therefore we perform additions:$Pant_{mean}= \\frac{(Hat\\ _price+Jacket\\_price)}{2} =>=\\frac{(25+75)}{2}$Now performing above arithmetic operation adds the numbers inside parenthesis so calculating sum here $(25+75)=$$We get 100,$Division performed outside Parentheses divides previous result.$=>$Mean\u00a0value represented earlier denoted '$Pant_{mean}'is calculated via division $\\rightarrow Pant_{mean}=\\frac{sum}{numberofterms}\\rightarrow =\\frac{100}{2}$.
