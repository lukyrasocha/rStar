However as long your meaning fits within normal mathematical expectations our process remains sound :) Since division here seems odd\u2026it makes sense intuitively since without additional information dividing even three among their own kids equally might not work correctly so let us leave things slightly looser perhaps allowing them all maybe share only once instead twice thus becoming just equal shares respectively still resulting fairly fair distribution overall though technically speaking no exact value could truly satisfy precisely every child getting doubled up exactly over individual totals considering varying circumstances possibly arising later down life paths involving new sibling additions etc..

Converting this into euros requires knowing or assuming current exchange rates but without them let\u2019s take our result at face value since we don\u2019t consider currency conversions here. To calculate what percent less expensive hiking boots would need to be compared to these sneakers considering other factors like material costs etc., you can simply subtract desired percentage reduction % (let say 'x')% off original amount i.e.. $(360-\\frac{360}{(1+X)}\\times\\frac{(cost)}{price})=\\frac{\\frac{360}{Price}-1}{\\frac{Cost}{Original Price}}\\times Original Cost$. Assuming all else being same ('Original Prices'), reduce only prices thus X=$Percentage$(in decimal form)/[1+(Percentage)(as Decimal)]$-1 because if pricing changed proportionately everyone keeps benefiting equally.

As such we can ignore these details when considering financial calculations related only to purchasing items like footwear.. It appears you want examples similar to those I generated initially about simple arithmetic operations involving counting objects and subtraction problems while integrating seemingly unrelated factual data as distractors.
