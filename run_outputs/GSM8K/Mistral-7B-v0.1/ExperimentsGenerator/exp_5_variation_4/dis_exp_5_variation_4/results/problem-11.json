Six smaller vans carry fifteen passengers(so six times this equals ninety), while twelve fifty pound miniatures carrying thirty employees would mean seventy-two additional riders. Adding them together results in twenty thousand minus three years. However you aren\u2019t actually dealing with humans but rather just numbers without any correlation whatsoever as specified within your question prompt thus disregarding those irrelevant statistics provided regarding 'bones'.

Thus; Total Capacity= 240+180+(150)=470people.. You cannot tell exactly who comes without additional constraints like ticket limits but maximum occupancy possible seems around this range using current fleet size & seating numbers provided above considering only space availability not other factors such as logistics etc while transporting whole team/group hence max permissible attendance estimated about close to mentioned calculation result i.e approx~ 470(without specific individual details implying exact values).
