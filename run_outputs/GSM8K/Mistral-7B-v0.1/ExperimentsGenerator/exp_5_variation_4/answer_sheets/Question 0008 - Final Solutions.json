The problem says there are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense. This means the number of players on the offense is twice the number of players on the defense. So let's say the number of players on the defense is x. The number of players on the offense is 2x. Next, I will identify the number of players on the defense. The problem states there are half the number of players on the special teams as there is on the defense. This means the number of players on the defense is half the number of players on the special teams. Let's call the number of players on the special teams y. So the number of players on the defense is y/2. Next, we will calculate the number of players on the special teams. We know the number of players on the football team is 105. We also know the number of players on the offense is 2x. And we know the number of players on the defense is y/2. So, 105 - (2x + y/2) is the number of players on the special teams. Now, we can solve for x and y. Substituting y/2 into the equation for the number of players on the special teams and simplifying, we get y/2 = 105 - (2x + y/2). Solving for y, we get 2y = 210 - 4x. Dividing both sides by 2, we get y = 105 - 2x. Now, substituting 105 - 2x into the equation for the number of players on the offense and simplifying, we get 2x = 210 - y. Solve for y, we get y = 105 - 2x. Substituting this back into the equation for the number of players on the defense, we get y/2 = 105 - (2(105 - 2x) + y/2). Simplifying, we get y/2 = 105 - (205 + y/2), which is equivalent to y/2 = 105 - 205. Since y/2 cannot be negative, we know that 105 - 205 must be positive. Therefore, the number of players on the defense must be less than or equal to 105 - 205. So, the number of players on the defense could be anything from 0 to 105 - 205 = -95.
