We need to find out how many employees can go on the day trip. First, let's count the capacity of the three types of vehicles. 4 buses can hold 60 employees. That's 60 * 4 = 240 employees. 6 minibusses can hold 30 employees. That's 30 * 6 = 180 employees. 10 minivans can hold 15 employees. That's 15 * 10 = 150 employees. Adding up, the total capacity is 240 + 180 + 150 = 570 employees. So, to know how many can actually go on the trip, we have to divide 206 (the number of bones) by the number of employees we can fit into each mode of transportation. So that is 206 / 4 or 206 / 6 or 206 / 10. 206 / 4 is 51.5 which means 51 people can ride in one bus. So it is 240 / 51 = 4.7 tenths of a bus. Or 206 / 6 is 34.33 tenths of a minibus. Or 206 / 10 is 20.6 tenths of a minivan. Since people can only ride in full minibusses and buses, but not in full minivans, we have to take the largest possible amount of riders. So it would be 6 * 30 = 180 + 4 * 60 = 240 = 420 employees. 206 is less than 420, so everyone fits.
