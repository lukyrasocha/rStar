Let's find out how many cookies she ate on Monday and Tuesday. On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister. That means Sue ate 4 * 5 = 20 cookies and her sister ate 5. On Tuesday, Sue ate 2 times as many cookies as her sister. That means Sue ate 2 * 13 = 26 cookies and her sister ate 13.\n\nOn Monday, Sue ate 20 cookies. Each cookie has 200 calories. So she ate 20 * 200 = 4,000 calories on Monday. On Tuesday, Sue ate 26 cookies. Each cookie has 200 calories. So she ate 26 * 200 = 5,200 calories on Tuesday.\n\nIn total, Sue ate 4,000 calories on Monday and 5,200 calories on Tuesday. So she consumed 4,000 + 5,200 = 9,200 calories.

And 2 times as many cookies as her sister on Tuesday. Her sister ate 5 cookies on Monday and 13 the next day. So we can calculate how many cookies Sue ate on Monday and Tuesday. Let's start with the second hint. Each cookie has 200 calories. The first hint says Sue eats 4 times as many cookies as her sister. So if her sister eats 5, then Sue eats 4 * 5 = 20 cookies. Now we have the number of cookies Sue ate on Monday. The third hint says there are 165 million square kilometers. We can convert this into a decimal number. It is 1.65E+8 square kilometers. Now let's go back to the last hint. Sue eats 20 cookies on Monday and 26 cookies on Tuesday. That means she eats 20 + 26 = 46 cookies total. To find out how many calories her sister ate, we have to divide the total number of calories (200 * 46) by the total number of cookies (46). This gives us 200/46 = 4.3478. Now let's go back to the second hint. Since Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister on Monday, and 2 times as many cookies as her sister on Tuesday, then her sister ate 20 / 4 = 5 cookies on Monday, and 26 / 2 = 13 cookies on Tuesday. This adds up to 18 cookies. We already know that one cookie has 200 calories, so it follows that her sister ate 200 * 18 = 3600 calories on those two days. Now we have all the information we need to find the answer. We know that Sue ate 20 + 26 = 46 cookies in total, and her sister ate 18 of them. So Sue ate 46 - 18 = 28 more cookies than her sister. And since each cookie has 200 calories, we multiply 28 by 200 to get the answer. 28 * 200 = 5600. So Sue consumed 5600 more calories than her sister.

On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister. That was 5 cookies. On Tuesday, Sue ate 2 times as many cookies as her sister. That means 2 times 5 = 10 cookies. Since Sue ate 10 cookies on Tuesday, she ate 10 - 5 = 5 cookies on Monday. Each cookie has 100 calories. 5 times 100 is 500.
