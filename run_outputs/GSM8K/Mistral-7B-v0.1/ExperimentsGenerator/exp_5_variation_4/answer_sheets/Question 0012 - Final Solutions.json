One notebook is sold at $1.5 each, a pen at $0.25 each, a calculator at $12 each, and a geometry set at $10 each. Daniel wants to buy 5 notebooks, 2 pens, 1 calculator, and 1 geometry set. To find out how much it would cost to purchase the same quantity of each item, let's look at the table below:\n\n| Item | Quantity | Price per item | Total price |\n|------|---------|----------------|-------------|\n| Notebooks | 5 | $1.5 | $7.5 |\n| Pens | 2 | $0.25 | $0.5 |\n| Calculators | 1 | $12 | $12 |\n| Geometry sets | 1 | $10 | $10 |\n| Total | 9 |  | $29.5 |\n\nNow, we need to determine what happens when Daniel uses the 10% discount. When using a 10% discount, 10% is removed from the original price. Let's see how this works:\n\nOriginal price: $29.5\nDiscount percentage: 10%\nDiscounted amount: $29.5 * 10% = $2.95\nFinal discounted price: $29.5 - $2.95 = $26.55\n\nTo get the final price, we simply multiply the original price by (1 - the discount percentage). For example, if there was a 10% discount, we would use (1 - 0.1) = 0.9 to calculate the new price. This means that the final discounted price is $29.5 * 0.9 = $26.55.\n\nIn summary, Daniel has to spend $26.55 on all the items he wants to buy.", "value": 0.375}}}, "rollout_id": 22}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "A shop sells school supplies.

Each pen costs $0.25, so the total cost of 2 pens is $0.25 * 2 = $0.50. Finally, let's look at the calculators. Since each calculator costs $12, the total cost of 1 calculator is $12. Lastly, we have the geometry sets. Each geometry set costs $10, so the total cost of 1 geometry set is $10.\n\nNow that we know the cost of everything, we can apply the 10% discount. We start with the total cost of everything before the discount, which is $7.50 + $0.50 + $12 + $10 = $29.50. To calculate the amount of the discount, we take 10% of the total cost: 10% of $29.50 = $2.95.

First we find the price of each item. One notebook is sold at 1.50 dollars each, a pen at 0.25 dollars each, a calculator at 12 dollars each, and a geometry set at 10 dollars each. Then we count how many items of each are being purchased. Daniel wants to buy 5 notebooks, 2 pens, 1 calculator, and 1 geometry set. The total price of all these is calculated as follows: (1.50 * 5) + (0.25 * 2) + (12 * 1) + (10 * 1) = 7.5 + 0.5 + 12 + 10 = 29.5.
