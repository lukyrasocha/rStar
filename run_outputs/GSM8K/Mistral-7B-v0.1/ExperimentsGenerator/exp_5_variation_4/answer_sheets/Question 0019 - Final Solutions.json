Louise is an artist and needs to apply a coat of varnish to her latest paintings. Usually it takes 7 minutes for the coat of varnish to dry on one painting. However, today she is using a new varnish and it takes 12 minutes for the coat to dry. How much longer will it take for the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish to dry as it would with the old varnish?", "ost_step": {}}, "1": {"subquestion": "How long does it take for the coat of varnish on one painting to dry using the old varnish?", "subanswer": {"text": "Let's think step by step. Each coat of varnish takes 7 minutes on the original painting and 12 minutes on the new paint. We want to know how long 1 coat takes. That means 7 minutes must equal 12 minutes times a fractional amount. In other words, 7 = 12x/12. So, 7/12 must equal x. This can be solved by rearranging the equation. 12x/12 = 7/12. Solving for x, we get x = 7. The answer is: 7 minutes.", "value": 0.2}, "ost_step": {}}, "2": {"subquestion": "Now we can answer the question: How long will it take for the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish to dry as it would with the old varnish?", "subanswer": {"text": "In the previous question, we found out that each coat takes 7 minutes when the old varnish is used. So, 6 coats (one for each painting) will take 6 * 7 = 42 minutes. Since the new varnish takes 12 minutes for each coat, 6 coats will take 12 * 6 = 72 minutes. Therefore, it will take 72 - 42 = 30 minutes longer to dry. The answer is 30 minutes.", "value": 0.2}, "ost_step": {}}}, "rollout_id": 14}]
