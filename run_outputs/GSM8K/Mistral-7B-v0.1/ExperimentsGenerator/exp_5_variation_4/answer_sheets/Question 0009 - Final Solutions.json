Firstly, we need to find the total number of people who were kicked out of the Walmart. From the problem statement, we know it is 50 people. We know that 3 people were kicked out for refusing to wear masks. We also know that a number equal to four times that many minus 5 was kicked out for shoplifting. Finally, we know that three times that number of shoplifters was kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. Let's solve for this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's find the number that was equal to four times that many minus 5. So, we can write this as:\n\n    (4x - 5) = ?\n\nTo solve this equation, we can use substitution. Let's replace ? with Y. Then our equation becomes:\n\n    (4Y - 5) = Y\n\nWe can subtract 5 from both sides to get:\n\n    4Y = Y + 5\n\nThen we can subtract Y from both sides to get:\n\n    3Y = 5\n\nFinally, we can divide both sides by 3 to get:\n\n    Y = 5/3\n\nSo, the number equal to four times that many minus 5 was 5/3.\n\nNext, let's find the number of shoplifters who were kicked out for physical violence. We know that 3 times the number of shoplifters who were kicked out for physical violence was equal to the number equal to four times that many minus 5. So, we can write this as:\n\n    (3 x Y) = (4x - 5)\n\nAgain, we can substitute values to simplify this equation. Let's replace 3x with Z, 4x with K, and 5 with W. Then our equation becomes:\n\n    (Z) = (K - W)\n\nNext, let's multiply both sides by 1/Z to get:\n\n    1 = (K / Z) - (W / Z)\n\nNow, we can add W/Z to both sides to get:\n\n    1 + (W / Z) = (K / Z)\n\nFinally, let's multiply both sides by Z to get:\n\n    (Z)(1 + (W / Z)) = (K)\n\nThis tells us that the number of shoplifters who were kicked out for physical violence was (K), which is equal to (4x - 5). Since we know that 4x is equal to 5/3, we can plug in these values to get the following equation:\n\n    (Z)(1 + ((5/3) / Z)) = (4x - 5)\n\nSimplifying this equation yields:\n\n    (Z)(1 + (5 / (3Z))) = (5/3 - 5)\n\nSubstituting in the value of Z yields:\n\n    (5/3 - 5) = ((5/3) - 5) / (1 + (5 / (3(5/3))))\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n    (5/3 - 5) = (-6 / 7)\n\nDividing both sides by 7 gives us our answer:\n\n    (5/3 - 5) / 7 = -6 / 7\n\nThis means that 6 people were kicked out of the Walmart for physical violence.

Using this in our equation 3y = z, we can solve for z. z = 3y = 3(z/3) = 3z/3 = z. This means that z = 3z/3 = 3. Therefore, y = (z/3) = (3/3) = 1. Finally, we have x = 3, y = 1, and z = 3. This means that 3 customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks, 1 person was kicked out for shoplifting, and 3 people were kicked out for physical violence.

First, let's focus on determining the number of people who were kicked out for not wearing masks. We know that three customers were kicked out, which is equal to 3. Next, let's determine the number of people who were kicked out for shoplifting. To do this, we can use the information provided in the hint. We know that 4 times the number of shoplifters is 4N, and we also know that subtracting 5 from 4 times the number of shoplifters gives us the correct number of people who were kicked out for shoplifting. We can rearrange this equation to solve for N. 4N - 5 = the number of people who were kicked out for shoplifting. This tells us that 4N = the number of people who were kicked out for shoplifting plus 5. Divide both sides by 4 to get N. This gives us N = (the number of people who were kicked out for shoplifting) / 4 + 5 / 4. Now that we know the value of N, we can substitute it into our original equation to find the correct number of people who were kicked out for shoplifting. 4N - 5 = 4(the number of people who were kicked out for shoplifting) - 5 = 4 * (the number of people who were kicked out for shoplifting) / 4 + 5 / 4 - 5 = the number of people who were kicked out for shoplifting + 5 / 4 - 5. This simplifies to the number of people who were kicked out for shoplifting + 5 / 4 - 5 = the number of people who were kicked out for shoplifting - 5 / 4 + 1 = the number of people who were kicked out for shoplifting. Now that we know the number of people who were kicked out for shoplifting, we can determine the number of people who were kicked out for other reasons. We know that 50 people were kicked out of the Walmart, and that the number of people who were kicked out for masks and shoplifting is less than 50. This means that the remaining number of people who were kicked out for other reasons is equal to 50 - the number of people who were kicked out for masks and shoplifting. Substitute in the values that we found earlier to solve for the number of people who were kicked out for other reasons. 50 - (3 + the number of people who were kicked out for shoplifting) = 50 - (3 + the number of people who were kicked out for shoplifting) = 50 - 3 - (the number of people who were kicked out for shoplifting). Simplifying further gives us 50 - 3 - (the number of people who were kicked out for shoplifting) = 47 - (the number of people who were kicked out for shoplifting).

We know there are 50 people who were kicked out of the Walmart for various reasons. Some were for not wearing masks, others were for shoplifting, and yet others were for violent behaviour.

This means that there were 50 - 3 = 47 people who were kicked out for other reasons. Now let's move onto finding the other numbers. It says that the number of shoplifters was 3 times the number of people who were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. Let's call it S (number of shoplifters). Now, let's look at the sentence \"A number equals to four times that many minus 5 were kicked out for shoplifting.\" What we want here is the number of shoplifters. Let's call it T (number of shoplifters). We can write an equation using what we know about the shoplifters. 4*S - 5 = T. We also know that 3*T were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. 3*T = S. Substitute T with 3*S. We get 4*3*S - 5 = S. We also know that S = 3*T. Replace S with 3*T in the previous equation. We get 4*(3*T) - 5 = (3*T). 12*T - 5 = 3*T. Multiply both sides by 3/12. We get T - 5/12 = T. Cancel out T. We get -5/12 = 0. Simplify. We get -5/12 = 0. 0 = -5/12. Add 5/12 to both sides. We get 5/12 = 5/12. Divide both sides by 5/12. We get 1 = 1. Therefore, the number of people who were kicked out for other reasons is 47.

Now, we know the number of people who were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale and the number of shoplifters. Let's find the number of people who were kicked out for other reasons. We know that 50 people were kicked out of the Walmart. To calculate the number of people who were kicked out for other reasons, we subtract the number of people who were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale and the number of shoplifters from 50. 50 - (the number of people who were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale) - (the number of shoplifters). We already calculated the number of people who were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale as 3 * (4 * N - 5). Subtracting that number from 50, we get 50 - (3 * (4 * N - 5)) = 50 - (3 * (4 * N - 5)) = 50 - 3 * (4 * N - 5) = 50 - 3 * (the number of shoplifters) = 50 - (3 * (4 * N - 5)) = 50 - (3 * (the number of shoplifters)).\n\nNow that we know the number of people who were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale, let's calculate the number of shoplifters. We know that the number of people who were kicked out for shoplifting equals to 4 * N - 5, where N is the number of shoplifters. 4 * N - 5 equals to the number of shoplifters. Solving for N, we get N = (4 * N - 5) / 4 = ((4 * N - 5) / 4) / 4 = (4 * N - 5) / 4 / 4 = (4 * N - 5) / 4 / 4 = (4 * N - 5) / 4 / 4 = (4 * N - 5) / 4 / 4 = (4 * N - 5) / 4 / 4 = (4 * N - 5) / 4 / 4 = (4 * N - 5) / 4 / 4 = (4 * N - 5) / 4 / 4 = (4 * N - 5) / 4 / 4 = N. So N = (4 * N - 5) / 4 = ((4 * N - 5) / 4) / 4 = (4 * N - 5) / 4 / 4 = (4 * N - 5) / 4 / 4 = (4 * N - 5) / 4 / 4 = (4 * N - 5) / 4 / 4 = (4 * N - 5) / 4 / 4 = (4 * N - 5) / 4 / 4 = (4 * N - 5) / 4 / 4 = (4 * N - 5) / 4 / 4 = N. So N = (4 * N - 5) / 4.\n\nNow, we know the number of shoplifters.

That means that there were 4(that many) - 5 = 4n - 5. But we still don't know what the number n stands for, so I will leave it like that. 3 times that same number was kicked out for violence. So 3 times that same number would be 3x. And 50 was kicked out in total. 50 - (3x + 4n - 5) = 50 - 3x - 4n + 5. Let's rewrite it as 45 = 3x + 4n - 5. But we still don't know what the number n stands for, so I will leave it like that. We need to figure out the values of n and x first, so let's solve this equation by using substitution method. Let's substitute n into the equation with m. 3m + 4m - 5. Then we will get 7m - 5. Then we will divide both sides by 7 and we will get 1m - 7/7. And then we will add 5 to both sides and get 1m - 7/7 + 5 which equals to 1m + 2 = 5. And then we will substract 2 from both sides and we will get 1m = 3. And then we will divide both sides by 1 and get m = 3. Now we have the value of m which is equal to 3. We can substitute this value back into the equation and we will get 3x + 4*3 - 5. Then we will multiply 4*3 and we will get 12x - 5. And then we will divide both sides by 12 and we will get x - 7/12. And then we will add 5 to both sides and get x - 7/12 + 5 which equals to x - 7/12 + 5/5 which is the same as x - 14/12. And then we will divide both sides by 1 and get x - 14/12 = 3. And then we will substract 14/12 from both sides and get x = 14/12 + 3 = 14/12 + 36/12 = 50/12. Therefore, 50/12 is the value of x.

The problem states three customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks."}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's think step by step. We know three customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks. Therefore, 3 customers equals to four times that many minus 5. That means we need to solve for x (four times that many) so that we can find how many people were kicked out for refusing to wear masks. 4x - 5 = 3. This tells us that x = 3 / 4. We know 3/4 = 0.75.\nSo there were 0.75 * 4 = 3 customers who refused to wear masks.\n\nThe next step is figuring out how many were kicked out for shoplifting. We know that three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. Since there were already 3 people kicked out for refusing to wear masks, that leaves (50 - 3) = 47 people. Three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. Solving for x (the number of shoplifters), we get x = 47 / 3. This means the number of people who were kicked out for shoplifting is 47 / 3.\n\nFinally, to find how many were kicked out for other reasons, we just subtract the numbers above: 50 - 3 - ((47 / 3) = (50 - 3 - 47 / 3). This simplifies to (50 - 3) - (47 / 3) = (47 / 3).\nThe answer is: (47 / 3).", "value": 0.09375}}}, "rollout_id": 13}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "The Eiffel Tower is 324 meters tall. 3 customers were kicked out of the Walmart for refusing to wear masks.
