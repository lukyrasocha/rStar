To solve this problem, we need to first convert 78% into a decimal number. So, 78% = 0.78. And, 100% = 1. Therefore, 78% = 78/100 = 0.78. Next, since 3 kangaroos travelling at the same speed can traverse the road for a period of 18 hours, we know that 1 kangaroo can traverse the road for a period of 18/3 hours. Hence, the time taken by one kangaroo to traverse the road is 6 hours. Furthermore, each turtle is moving at half the speed of a kangaroo. Therefore, the time taken by one turtle to traverse the road is twice that of the kangaroo, or 12 hours. Finally, using the proportion of nitrogen to all gases, which is 1:0.78, we can determine the time taken by the four turtles to traverse the road.
