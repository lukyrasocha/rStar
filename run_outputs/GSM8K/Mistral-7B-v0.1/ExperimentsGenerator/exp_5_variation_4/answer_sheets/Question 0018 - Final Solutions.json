The second test has 40 questions.\n\nTo calculate how many questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test to pass, we need to figure out how many questions Audrey needs to get right on the first test to pass. We know that to pass the first test, she needs to get 60% of the 70 questions correct. This means that she needs to get 60% of 70 questions correct, which is 42 questions correct.\n\nNow, we can use this information to calculate how many questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test to pass. We know that to pass the second test, Audrey needs to get 70% of the 40 questions correct. Since she already got 42 questions correct on the first test, this means that she only needs to get 28 questions correct on the second test (70% of 40 is 28).\n\nTherefore, the answer is: 28.", "value": 0.09375}}}, "rollout_id": 26}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "There are about 7.8 billion people on Earth.

We can calculate how many questions you need to get right on the second test to pass: 6th grade math. You have to get 70% of the total questions right. The first test had 70 questions and you got 60%. That means you got 60% of 70 questions, or 42 correct answers. Since you only needed 70%, you only needed 42. You also needed to get 70% of the second test right. You got 40 questions on the second test and you got 60% correct, or 24 correct answers. In order to pass, you need to get 70% of the total questions right. 70% of the total questions is 70% * 40 questions, which is 28 questions correct. That is your final answer.
