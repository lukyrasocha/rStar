Let's think step by step. A football team has 105 members. Offense has twice as many players as defense. So if we assume that there are 'x' players on defense, then there would be 2x players on the offense. Also, there are half as many players on special teams as there is on defense. So if there is y players on the special teams, then we know that there would be y/2 players on the defense. We can write out the equations like this:\n2*x+y=105\nx+y/2=52.5\nWe solve the system using substitution to get:\n2*52.5 = 105 - y\ny = 52.5\nSo there are 52.5 players on offense and 52.5 players on defense.
