That means the difference between these two values is 817 - 503 = 314. But we already calculated that there are 5.3 buses rented. We know that each bus holds 94 people, so 5.3 * 94 = 499.6 which is slightly larger than 503. This implies that not all seats could be occupied. We can calculate the number of free seats by dividing 503 - 499.6 = 3.4 by 94, which is 0.0365. Rounded off to one decimal point, that is 0.04. We can assume that all seats of 5 minibuses, which are 5 * 39 = 195 seats, and 8 minivans, which are 8 * 19 = 152 seats, will be filled, meaning that 314 - 195 - 152 = 67 seats will remain empty.
