That looks like this: Number of players on special teams = 0.5 * (2 * Number of players on defense) We can simplify this equation further by multiplying both sides by 2.

We know that there are 91 members on the football team. The problem says that there is twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense. So let's call the number of players on the offense 'a', and the number of players on the defense 'b'. a = b * 2. And we also know that there is half the number of players on the special teams as there is on the defense. So we can call the number of players on the special teams 'c', and we can say c = b / 2. So we can write down this set of equations: a = b * 2, and c = b / 2. Using algebra, we can solve for 'b': b = c / 2, since c = b / 2. So we can rewrite our set of equations like this: a = (c/2) * 2, and c = b / 2. Solving for 'a' gives us a = c, so we can use this fact to substitute in for 'a'. So now we get a = c, and c = b / 2. Substituting in for 'c' gives us a = b / 2, which simplifies to a = b. We know that a = b * 2, so this gives us b = b * 2 / b, which simplifies to b = 2.
