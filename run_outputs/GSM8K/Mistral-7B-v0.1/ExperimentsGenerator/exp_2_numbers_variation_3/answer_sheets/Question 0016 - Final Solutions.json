Since we know that the sour milk can't be sold, we must subtract it from the amount he originally purchased. Firstly, we need to find out how much was purchased: 1509 gallons of milk was sold by the company to Mr. Marcellus's store. Therefore, the amount purchased is 1509 gallons. Secondly, we calculate 4/8 of that amount. Remembering the rule that multiplication of fractions is the same as multiplying the numerators and denominators separately, we have: 1509 / 8 gallons of milk that is sour cannot be sold. Thirdly, we deduct the sour milk from the total amount purchased. Therefore, the amount that the company gets back is 1509 - 1509 / 8 = (1509)(7/8) gallons. Finally, since one gallon costs $2, we divide the result by 2 to obtain the refunded amount. Thus, the refunded amount is ((1509)(7/8)) / 2 = (1509)(7/16) dollars.
