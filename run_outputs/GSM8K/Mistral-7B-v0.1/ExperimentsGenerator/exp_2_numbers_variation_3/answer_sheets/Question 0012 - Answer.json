Daniel is a engineering student, and Daniel wants to buy 5 notebooks, 7 pens, 1 calculator, and 1 geometry set. The shop gives a 6% discount on all the purchased items. How much does Daniel have to spend on all the items Daniel wants to buy?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "5 notebooks cost 5 x $2 = $<<5*2=10>>10.\n7 pens cost 7 x $2 = $<<7*2=14>>14.\nThe total cost is $10 + $14 = $<<10+14=24>>50.\nThe total discount is 6% of $50 = $<<6*50/100=3>>3.\nTherefore, Daniel has to spend $50 - $3 = $<<50-3=47>>47 on all the items Daniel wants to buy.\n#### 47", "gold_answer": "47"}
