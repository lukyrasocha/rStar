According to the problem, it is 9440. Next we figure out what fraction of these pieces Poppy placed. It says she placed one quarter of them. So 1/4 of 9440 is 9440 / 4 = 2360. Then she also placed 1/3 of the remaining pieces. What remains after she placed one quarter of the pieces is (1 - 1/4) * 9440 = 9440 / 4 * 3 = 7080. Out of this many, she placed 1/3 of them. 1/3 of 7080 is 7080 / 3 = 2360. So the total amount of pieces she placed is 2360 + 2360 = 4720. Finally, the number of pieces left to be placed is 9440 - 4720 = 4720.
