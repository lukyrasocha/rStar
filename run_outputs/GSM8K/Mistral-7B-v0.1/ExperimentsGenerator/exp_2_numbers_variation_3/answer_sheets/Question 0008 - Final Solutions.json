We know that there are 91 members on the football team. The problem says that there is twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense. So let's call the number of players on the offense 'a', and the number of players on the defense 'b'. a = b * 2. And we also know that there is half the number of players on the special teams as there is on the defense. So we can call the number of players on the special teams 'c', and we can say c = b / 2. So we can write down this set of equations: a = b * 2, and c = b / 2. Using algebra, we can solve for 'b': b = c / 2, since c = b / 2. So we can rewrite our set of equations like this: a = (c/2) * 2, and c = b / 2. Solving for 'a' gives us a = c, so we can use this fact to substitute in for 'a'. So now we get a = c, and c = b / 2. Substituting in for 'c' gives us a = b / 2, which simplifies to a = b. We know that a = b * 2, so this gives us b = b * 2 / b, which simplifies to b = 2.

The problem states that there are 91 members on the football team. It also says there are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense. Therefore, there are 91 / 2 = 45 players on the offense. We are looking for the number of players on the defense. We know the number of players on the special teams, which is half the number of players on the defense. So, if the number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, then the number of players on the defense can be computed as follows: (Number of players on the special teams) x 2. Therefore, we need to compute the number of players on the special teams first. Since we are told that the number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, it means the number of players on the special teams is equal to the number of players on the defense divided by 2. So, (Number of players on the special teams) = (Number of players on the defense) / 2. Substituting for (Number of players on the special teams), we get: (Number of players on the special teams) x 2 = ((Number of players on the special teams) / 2) x 2 = (Number of players on the special teams) x 1. Therefore, (Number of players on the special teams) x 1 = 45. Dividing both sides of this equation by 1, we get: (Number of players on the special teams) = 45. This means there are 45 players on the special teams. Since the number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, then the number of players on the defense can be computed as follows: (Number of players on the special teams) x 2.

Dividing both sides of this equation by 2, we get: ((Number of players on the special teams) x 2) / 2 = 45 / 2. Simplifying, we get: ((Number of players on the special teams) x 2) / 2 = 45 / 2.
