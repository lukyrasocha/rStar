The problem says that it takes 3 kangaroos traveling at the same speed a total of 18 hours to travel across a highway. We can use this information to determine the number of kangaroos and their speed. Since it takes 3 kangaroos a total of 18 hours to travel across the highway, we can divide 18 by 3 to get the time it takes one kangaroo to travel across the highway. This means that one kangaroo travels across the highway in 6 hours. So, 1 kangaroo travels 1/6 of the distance across the highway every hour. Now, we can use this information to calculate the number of kangaroos. We know that it takes 3 kangaroos a total of 18 hours to travel across the highway. This means that in 18 hours, the 3 kangaroos traveled 3/6 of the distance across the highway, or 1/2 of the distance across the highway. Since 1 kangaroo travels 1/6 of the distance across the highway every hour, we can calculate the number of hours it would take 4 turtles to do so. It would take 4 turtles 4/12 of the distance across the highway per hour, or 1/3 of the distance across the highway per hour.

So: 1 kangaroo x 3 = 3 kangaroos x 1 = 3 hours. That's how long it would take one kangaroo to cross the road. Second, we need to find out how long it would take one turtle to cross the road. We know that a turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, meaning that if you divide the time taken by a kangaroo to cross the road by 2, this will tell us the time it would take a turtle to cross the road. So: 1 turtle x (3 / 2) = 3 turtles x (1 / 2) = 3 hours. That's how long it would take one turtle to cross the road.
