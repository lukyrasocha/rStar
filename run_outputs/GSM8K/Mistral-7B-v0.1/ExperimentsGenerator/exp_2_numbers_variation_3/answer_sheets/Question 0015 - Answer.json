{"id": 1145, "problem": "Faraday owns a flower shop. He sells a sunflower that costs $5 each and a bouquet of sunflower that costs $1. If Faraday earned $32 from the sunflower and $32 from the bouquet per day, and if each bouquet has 14 sunflowers, how many sunflowers was Faraday able to sell after 10 days?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "Faraday sold $32 / $1 = <<32/1=32>>32 bouquets of sunflower.\nSo he was able to sell a total of 14 x 32 = <<14*32=448>>448 sunflowers from the bouquets.\nAnd he was able to sell a total of $32/$5= <<32/5=6.4>>6.4 Sunflowers.\nThe sum of sunflowers Faraday was able to sell is 448 + 6.4 = <<448+6.4=454.4>>454.4.\nTherefore, the total of sunflowers he sold after 10 days is 454.4 x 10 = <<454.4*10=4544>>4544.\n#### 4544", "gold_answer": "4544"}
