They both ate 3 cookies. So Sue ate 3x, while her sister ate 3y. Sue ate 3x and her sister ate 3y. Let's call it z. So (3x) + (3y) = (3z). But we know (3y) is equal to 3 (because y is equal to 1). We know x equals 3 too. We know that (3y) is also equal to 3, because y is equal to 1. So x + y = 3z. And we already know that (x + y) is equal to 6, since they ate 3 each. That means 6 equals 3z. So 2z = 6. 2z divided by 2 equals z divided by 2. 6 divided by 2 is 3. So z is 3. This means that Sue ate 3x which is 3 * 3 = 9 cookies.\n\nLet's take this information and plug it into the rest of the equation. On Tuesday, Sue ate 3x, while her sister ate 3y. z equals 3. So (3y) is equal to (3 * 3), or 9. Sue ate 9 cookies and her sister ate 3 cookies on Tuesday. Again, let's call it z. So (3x) + (3y) = (3z). (3 * 3) + (3 * 1) = (3 * 3). We get 3 * 3 again, so x + y = 3z. We know (3x) is equal to 9, because Sue ate 9 cookies. And we know y is equal to 1, because her sister ate 3 cookies on Tuesday. So x + y = 3z becomes 9 + 1 = 3z. But x + y is already equal to 6, so it becomes 6 + 1 = 3z. This means 7 equals 3z. 7 / 3 is 2. So z is 2. This means that Sue ate 3x which is 3 * 2 = 6 cookies, and her sister ate 3y which is 3 * 1 = 3 cookies on Tuesday.\n\nNow we need to find out how many calories were consumed. We know that Sue ate 6 cookies and her sister ate 3 cookies. Each cookie contains 173 calories, so we know that Sue consumed 173 * 6 = 1038 calories. We also know that her sister consumed 173 * 3 = 519 calories. To find out the difference, we simply subtract the smaller number from the larger one: 1038 - 519. This gives us 519 calories.
