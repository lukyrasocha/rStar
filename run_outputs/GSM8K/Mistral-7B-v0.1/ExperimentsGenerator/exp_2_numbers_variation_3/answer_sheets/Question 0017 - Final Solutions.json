The first thing we need to do is convert the speed. We know that one hour contains 60 minutes. But one minute also contains 60 seconds. So one hour contains 60 x 60 seconds. And 60 minutes contain 60 x 60 x 24 hours. That's because a day contains 24 hours. Also, if you multiply 1000 by itself twice, you get 1000 x 1000 = 1 million. One kilometer is 1000 meters, so 1000 x 1000 = 1 million meters. If our speed was 50 km/hour, it would be 50 x 1000 m/hr. But since we want to know the distance travelled, we need to know how many meters per second. So our speed is actually 50 x 1000 x 60 = 3000000.\n\nThe next thing we need to find out is the total distance travelled. To do this, we can use the formula d = r*t, where d is the distance, r is the rate, and t is the time. Let's say Michael travels at 3000000 meters per second. If he is travelling for 2 days, which is 24 hours each, then the total distance is 3000000*24*2 = 14400000 meters.\n\nFinally, we can use the formula p = 100%*(d1/d2). Where d1 is the total distance travelled, and d2 is the total distance. Since Michael has travelled 14400000 meters, and the total distance is 3000000 meters, then p = 100%*(14400000/3000000) = 8%.
