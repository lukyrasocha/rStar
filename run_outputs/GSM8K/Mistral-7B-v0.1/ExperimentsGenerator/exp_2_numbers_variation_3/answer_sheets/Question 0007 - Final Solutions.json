First, we need to find out how many cookies Sue ate on Monday and Tuesday. Since she ate 3 times as many cookies as her sister on Monday, and 2 times as many on Tuesday, let's call the number of cookies Sue ate X. This means that Sue ate 3X on Monday and 2X on Tuesday. Her sister ate 3 cookies on Monday and 7 the next day. That's a total of 3+7=10 cookies eaten by her sister.

They both ate 3 cookies. So Sue ate 3x, while her sister ate 3y. Sue ate 3x and her sister ate 3y. Let's call it z. So (3x) + (3y) = (3z). But we know (3y) is equal to 3 (because y is equal to 1). We know x equals 3 too. We know that (3y) is also equal to 3, because y is equal to 1. So x + y = 3z. And we already know that (x + y) is equal to 6, since they ate 3 each. That means 6 equals 3z. So 2z = 6. 2z divided by 2 equals z divided by 2. 6 divided by 2 is 3. So z is 3. This means that Sue ate 3x which is 3 * 3 = 9 cookies.\n\nLet's take this information and plug it into the rest of the equation. On Tuesday, Sue ate 3x, while her sister ate 3y. z equals 3. So (3y) is equal to (3 * 3), or 9. Sue ate 9 cookies and her sister ate 3 cookies on Tuesday. Again, let's call it z. So (3x) + (3y) = (3z). (3 * 3) + (3 * 1) = (3 * 3). We get 3 * 3 again, so x + y = 3z. We know (3x) is equal to 9, because Sue ate 9 cookies. And we know y is equal to 1, because her sister ate 3 cookies on Tuesday. So x + y = 3z becomes 9 + 1 = 3z. But x + y is already equal to 6, so it becomes 6 + 1 = 3z. This means 7 equals 3z. 7 / 3 is 2. So z is 2. This means that Sue ate 3x which is 3 * 2 = 6 cookies, and her sister ate 3y which is 3 * 1 = 3 cookies on Tuesday.\n\nNow we need to find out how many calories were consumed. We know that Sue ate 6 cookies and her sister ate 3 cookies. Each cookie contains 173 calories, so we know that Sue consumed 173 * 6 = 1038 calories. We also know that her sister consumed 173 * 3 = 519 calories. To find out the difference, we simply subtract the smaller number from the larger one: 1038 - 519. This gives us 519 calories.

On Tuesday, she ate 2x as many as her sister. We can use variables to represent the amounts of cookies eaten by each person on each day. For example, we can let x represent the number of cookies Sue's sister ate on Monday, and y represent the number of cookies Sue's sister ate on Tuesday. We know that Sue ate 3x cookies on Monday, so x is the amount of cookies her sister ate. We also know that Sue ate 2y cookies on Tuesday, so y is the amount of cookies her sister ate. Therefore, the amount of cookies Sue ate on each day is 3x for Monday and 2y for Tuesday. We need to find the total number of cookies Sue ate. To do this, we add up the number of cookies she ate on both days, which is 3x + 2y. Since 1 cookie has 173 calories, we need to multiply the total number of cookies by 173 to get the total number of calories. So, the total number of calories Sue consumed is (3x + 2y) * 173. We can use what we know about the sisters' cookie consumption to fill in the missing information. We know that Sue's sister ate 3 cookies on Monday, so x = 3. And, we know that Sue's sister ate 7 cookies on Tuesday, so y = 7. Substituting these values into our equation for the total number of cookies, we get 3x + 2y = 3(3) + 2(7) = 9 + 14 = 23. Finally, we multiply this by 173 to get the total number of calories Sue consumed, which is (3x + 2y) * 173 = 23 * 173 = 3979.
