A pen is sold at $2 each. So it also costs $2. Third, we need to find out the cost of 1 calculator. A calculator is sold at $20 each. So 1 calculator costs $20. Finally, we find out the cost of 1 geometry set. It costs $6 each. So 1 geometry set costs $6. Daniel wants to buy 5 notebooks, 7 pens, 1 calculator, and 1 geometry set. First, 5 notebooks, so that would be $2 * 5 = $10. Second, 7 pens, so that would be $2 * 7 = $14. Third, 1 calculator, so that would be $20. Fourth, 1 geometry set, so that would be $6.
