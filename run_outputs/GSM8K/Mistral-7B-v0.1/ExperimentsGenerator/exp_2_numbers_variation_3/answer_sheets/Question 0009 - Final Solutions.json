This means that 4x - 4 people were thrown out for shoplifting, and 4(4x - 4) people were thrown out for physical violence. Together, these make up all the people thrown out of the store for various reasons. We can represent them as follows:\n\n4x - 4 for shoplifting,\n4(4x - 4) for physical violence,\nand 63 for other reasons.\n\nNow let's add these numbers together:\n4x - 4 + 4(4x - 4) + 63 = 4x - 4 + 16x - 16 + 63 = 20x - 10 = 63.\n\nWe can isolate x by adding 10 to both sides:\n20x - 10 + 10 = 63 + 10.\n\n20x = 73.\n\nTo find x, we divide both sides by 20:\nx = 73 / 20 = 3.65.\n\nSo there were 3.65 people thrown out of the Walmart for other reasons.

Four times that number of shoplifters were kicked out for shoplifting. This means that 4 * the number of shoplifters - 4 customers were kicked out. This must be equal to 63 - 4 because we know there are 63 customers total. So 4*the number of shoplifters - 4 = 63 - 4. Solving for the number of shoplifters, we get 4*the number of shoplifters - 4 = 63 - 4. Adding 4 to both sides, we get 4*(the number of shoplifters) = 67. Dividing by 4, we get the number of shoplifters is 17. Three times the number of shoplifters was kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. So we have 17 * 3, or 51, customers being kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. Now all that's left are the customers who were kicked out for other reasons.

We need to find the number of customers who were kicked out for other reasons. According to the problem, four times the number of customers who refused to wear masks minus 4 was equal to the number of customers who were kicked out for shoplifting. Three times that many customers were kicked out for physical violence. Finally, the total number of customers who were kicked out is 63. So we need to solve these three equations:\n\n1. 4x - 4 = y // where x is the number of customers who were kicked out for not wearing masks, and y is the number of customers who were kicked out for shoplifting.\n2. 3y = z // where y is the number of customers who were kicked out for shoplifting, and z is the number of customers who were kicked out for physical violence.\n3. x + y + z = 63 // where x is the number of customers who were kicked out for not wearing masks, y is the number of customers who were kicked out for shoplifting, and z is the number of customers who were kicked out for physical violence.\n\nSolve these three equations one by one. First, multiply both sides of equation 1 by 4:\n\n4(4x - 4) = 4y\n// 16x - 16 = 4y\n// 16x = 4y + 16\n\nNow add 4 to both sides:\n\n16x + 4 = 4y + 16 + 4\n// 16x + 4 = 4y + 20\n// 16x = 4y + 20 - 4\n// 16x = 4y + 16\n\nFinally, divide both sides by 4:\n\nx = (4y + 16) / 4\n\nSo the number of customers who were kicked out for not wearing masks is x. This is equal to 4y plus 16 divided by 4.\n\nNow substitute this value into equation 2:\n\n3((4y + 16) / 4) = z\n// 3(4y + 16) / 4 = z\n// 12y + 48 / 4 = z\n// 3y + 12 = z\n\nAdd 12 to both sides:\n\n3y + 12 + 12 = z + 12\n// 3y = z + 12 - 12\n// 3y = z\n\nFinally, divide both sides by 3:\n\ny = z / 3\n\nSo the number of customers who were kicked out for shoplifting is y, which is equal to z divided by 3. Substitute this value into equation 3:\n\nx + y + z / 3 = 63\n// x + z / 3 + z / 3 = 63\n// x + 2z / 3 = 63\n// 3x + 6z = 189\n\nMultiply both sides by 3:\n\n3(3x + 6z) = 3(189)\n// 9x + 18z = 567\n\nSubtract 9x from both sides:\n\n9x + 18z - 9x = 567 - 9x\n// 18z = 567 - 9x\n\nDivide both sides by 18:\n\n18z / 18 = (567 - 9x) / 18\n// z = (567 - 9x) / 18\n\nSo the number of customers who were kicked out for physical violence is z. This is equal to 567 minus 9x divided by 18. The number of customers who were kicked out for other reasons is x minus y minus z, or x minus z / 3 minus z. Substitute the values of x and z from before:\n\nx - z / 3 - z = (4y + 16) / 4 - z / 3 - z\n// (4y + 16) / 4 - z / 3 - z\n\nSimplify:\n\n// (4y + 16 - 3z) / 4\n\nSubstitute the value of y from before:\n\n// (4z / 3 + 16 - 3z) / 4\n\nSimplify:\n\n// ((", "value": 0.15625}}}, "rollout_id": 15}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "4 customers were kicked out of the Walmart for refusing to wear masks.

Four times that many minus 4 equals to 4 * X - 4, where X represents the number of customers who were kicked out of the Walmart for refusing to wear masks."}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's think step by step. First of all, we can identify the number of customers who were kicked out of the Walmart for refusing to wear masks. It is equal to the value of X. According to the problem, this number equals to four times that many minus 4. We can write it as a formula: X = 4*X - 4. We know that X is an integer. To solve this equation, we need to find the value of X that satisfies the condition X = 4*X - 4. We can multiply both sides of the equation by -1 and get -X = -4*X + 4. This makes it easier to solve because we don't have to use the same variable twice. Solving for X gives us -X = 4*X - 4. Adding 4 to both sides gives us -X+4=4*X. Dividing by 3 gives us -X/3=X. Multiplying both sides by -3 gives us X=-X/3. Substituting this value into the original equation gives us X=-X/3=4*(-X/3)-4. Simplifying gives us X=-1. Therefore, 4 customers were kicked out of the Walmart for refusing to wear masks.\n\nNext, according to the second sentence, a number equals to four times that many minus 4 were kicked out for shoplifting. Let's call that number Z. We can write it as a formula: Z = 4*X - 4. We also know that Z is an integer. Solving for X gives us Z = 4*Z - 4. Adding 4 to both sides gives us Z+4=4*Z. Dividing by 3 gives us Z+4/3=Z. Multiplying both sides by -3 gives us Z+4/3=-Z. Substituting this value into the original equation gives us Z+4/3=-Z=4*(-Z/3)-4. Simplifying gives us Z+4/3=-Z=-Z/3. Combining both equations gives us Z+4/3=-Z=-Z/3. Solving for Z gives us Z+4/3=-Z/3. Adding Z to both sides gives us Z+4/3+Z/3=-Z/3+Z/3. Simplifying gives us (Z+4)/3=-Z/3. Multiplying both sides by 3 gives us Z+4=-Z/3*3. Simplifying gives us Z+4=-Z. Subtracting 4 from both sides gives us Z=-Z+4. Solving for Z gives us Z=-Z+4=-Z. Subtracting Z from both sides gives us Z-Z=4. Solving for Z gives us Z=4. Therefore, a number equals to four times that many minus 4 were kicked out for shoplifting.\n\nFinally, three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. Let's call that number Y. We can write it as a formula: Y = 3*Z. We also know that Y is an integer. Solving for Y gives us Y = 3*Y. Divide by 3 and simplify to get Y = Y. Therefore, Y = Z.\n\nThe final answer is Z+4. From earlier in the problem, we found that Z = 4. Plugging Z = 4 into our final answer gives us Z+4 = 4 + 4 = 8.

We have 4 customers who were kicked out for not wearing masks. 4 times that number, which would be 4 * 4, would result in 16 people being kicked out for refusing to wear masks.

Finally, 3 times that number, which would be 3 * 16, would result in 48 people kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. We are told that a total of 63 people were kicked out, so our equation would be 16 + 16 + 48 + X = 63. Let's solve this equation for X. The first thing you should notice is that when you add 16 + 16 together, it is equal to 32. This means that 32 cancels out as a common factor in the equation. Therefore, (16 + 16) + 48 + X = 63 can be rewritten as 48 + X = 63, since the 32 cancels out. This leaves us with X = 63 - 48, which simplifies to X = 15.

We know that this was 4x - 4. To find the value of x, we set up an equation and solved for x.\n\n1.

We know that this was equal to three times the number of people kicked out for shoplifting.
