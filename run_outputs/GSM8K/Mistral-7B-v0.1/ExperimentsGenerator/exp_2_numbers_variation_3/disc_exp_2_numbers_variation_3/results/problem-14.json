Gait analysis through various methodologies including video recording and sensors typically focuses on lower limb movement patterns since this pertains directly to locomotion. However, upper body motion like arm swing is also crucial because both arms usually move nearly symmetrically during walking. Discrepancies in arm swing synchronization could indicate coordination problems characteristic of certain conditions affecting motor control systems within the brain, such as Parkinson\u2019s disease. This condition often manifests with reduced amplitude and asymmetrical movements due to basal ganglia degeneration\u2014a part of the brain essential for regulating voluntary motions.
