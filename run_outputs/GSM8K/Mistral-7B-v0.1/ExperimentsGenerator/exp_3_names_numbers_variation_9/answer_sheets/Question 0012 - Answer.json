Steven is a engineering student, and Steven wants to buy 3 notebooks, 7 pens, 1 calculator, and 1 geometry set. The shop gives a 20% discount on all the purchased items. How much does Steven have to spend on all the items Steven wants to buy?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "3 notebooks cost 3 x $5 = $<<3*5=15>>15.\n7 pens cost 7 x $1 = $<<7*1=7>>7.\nThe total cost is $15 + $7 = $<<15+7=22>>40.\nThe total discount is 20% of $40 = $<<20*40/100=8>>8.\nTherefore, Steven has to spend $40 - $8 = $<<40-8=32>>32 on all the items Steven wants to buy.\n#### 32", "gold_answer": "32"}
