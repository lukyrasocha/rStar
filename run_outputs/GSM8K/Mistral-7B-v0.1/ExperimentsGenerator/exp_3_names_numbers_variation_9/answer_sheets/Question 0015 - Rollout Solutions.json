Using this formula, we get: ((number of sunflowers sold) x 10) + (100/12) * number of bouquets sold = 190. Since the total earnings from the sunflowers and bouquets is $190, we can rearrange this equation to find out how many sunflowers Thomas was able to sell after 8 days. After rearranging, we get: number of sunflowers sold = (190 - (100/12) * number of bouquets sold) / 10. Plugging in the values for total earnings of $190 and number of bouquets sold of 8, we get: number of sunflowers sold = (190 - (100/12) * 8) / 10 = 25.
