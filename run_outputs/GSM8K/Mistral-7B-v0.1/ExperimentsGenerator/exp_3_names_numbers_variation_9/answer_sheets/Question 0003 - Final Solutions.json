Since he reads twice a week, he spends 5 * 2 = 10 hours a week reading. Finally, we can calculate how many hours Anthony spends on TV and reading in 14 weeks. We multiply the time spent per week by 14 weeks. This results in 10 (hours spent on TV per week) * 14 (weeks) = 140 hours spent on TV in 14 weeks.
