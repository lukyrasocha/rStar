{"id": 1145, "problem": "Thomas owns a flower shop. He sells a sunflower that costs $10 each and a bouquet of sunflower that costs $6. If Thomas earned $90 from the sunflower and $100 from the bouquet per day, and if each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, how many sunflowers was Thomas able to sell after 8 days?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "Thomas sold $100 / $6 = <<100/6=16.666666666666668>>16.666666666666668 bouquets of sunflower.\nSo he was able to sell a total of 12 x 16.666666666666668 = <<12*16.666666666666668=200>>200 sunflowers from the bouquets.\nAnd he was able to sell a total of $90/$10= <<90/10=9>>9 Sunflowers.\nThe sum of sunflowers Thomas was able to sell is 200 + 9 = <<200+9=209>>209.\nTherefore, the total of sunflowers he sold after 8 days is 209 x 8 = <<209*8=1672>>1672.\n#### 1672", "gold_answer": "1672"}
