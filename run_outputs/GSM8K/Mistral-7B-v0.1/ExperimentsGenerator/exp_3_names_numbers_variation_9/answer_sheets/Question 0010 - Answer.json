{"id": 376, "problem": "There are 32 pupils in a class. Half of the class likes blue. One-fourth of the remaining likes green and the rest likes yellow. How many pupils like the color yellow?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "There are 32/2 = <<32/2=16>>16 pupils who like blue.\nSo, there are now 32 - 16 = <<32-16=16>>16 pupils who like either green or yellow.\nHence, 16/4 = <<16/4=4>>4 pupils like green.\nThus, 16 - 4 = <<16-4=12>>12 pupils like yellow.\n#### 12", "gold_answer": "12"}
