{"id": 376, "problem": "There are 56 pupils in a class. Half of the class likes blue. One-fourth of the remaining likes green and the rest likes yellow. How many pupils like the color yellow?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "There are 56/2 = <<56/2=28>>28 pupils who like blue.\nSo, there are now 56 - 28 = <<56-28=28>>28 pupils who like either green or yellow.\nHence, 28/4 = <<28/4=7>>7 pupils like green.\nThus, 28 - 7 = <<28-7=21>>21 pupils like yellow.\n#### 21", "gold_answer": "21"}
