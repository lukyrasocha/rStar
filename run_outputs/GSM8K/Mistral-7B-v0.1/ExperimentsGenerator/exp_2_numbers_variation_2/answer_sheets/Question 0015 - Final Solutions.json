First, I identify the prices and revenues from the problem. The price of a single sunflower is $3. The price of a bouquet of sunflowers is $12. The revenue from selling 1 sunflower per day is $29. The revenue from selling 1 bouquet of sunflowers per day is $94. To find the amount of sunflowers sold after 4 days, we need to find the revenue earned from sunflower sales after 4 days. To do this, we multiply the revenue from selling a sunflower ($29) by the number of days the sunflowers are sold (4). This gives us $116, which is the total revenue from sunflower sales after 4 days. Next, we need to convert this revenue into the number of sunflowers sold. To do this, we divide the total revenue ($116) by the price of a single sunflower ($3). This gives us 38.66. However, since the problem asks for the whole number of sunflowers, we can round up or down to the nearest whole number.

It cost $12 per bouquet, so that's $3 per sunflower. Since it costs $3 per sunflower, we can use this information to solve for how many sunflowers Faraday sold. $29 is the amount Faraday earned per day from sunflowers. We know that 7 sunflowers make up a bouquet. Therefore, we need to divide $29 by 7, which equals $4.14 per bouquet. 4 x $4.14 equals $16.56 per day. Now that we have the daily earnings, we can use that to calculate how many sunflowers were sold after 4 days. Let's write a formula that describes this relationship. We know that 4 x $4.14 equals $16.56, so we can subtract $16.56 from $29 to find how much Faraday earned per day from sunflower sales, since we already know what he earned per day from bouquet sales. That would give us $12.44. We also know that 7 sunflowers make up a bouquet, so we can take $12.44 and divide it by 7 to get $1.78. This represents how much Faraday earned per sunflower. Since he earned $1.78 per sunflower per day, we can multiply that times 4 to get how much he earned per sunflower over 4 days. That would give us $7.12. So we can use this information to calculate how many sunflowers he was able to sell after 4 days. Since he earned $29 per day from sunflower sales, we can subtract $7.12 from $29 to find how much more Faraday earned per day from sunflower sales than he earned per day from bouquet sales. That would give us $21.88. We can use this information to determine how many sunflowers Faraday was able to sell after 4 days. We know that 7 sunflowers make up a bouquet, so we can take $21.88 and divide it by 7 to get $3.13. This represents how much Faraday earned from 1 bouquet. Since he earned $3.13 per bouquet, we can multiply that times 4 to get how much he earned from 4 bouquets. That would give us $12.52. To find how many sunflowers Faraday was able to sell after 4 days, we can take $12.52 and divide it by $3.13, which equals 4. We can use this information to calculate how many sunflowers Faraday was able to sell after 4 days. If you want to check your work, you can add up the answers to our calculations. We found that Faraday was able to sell $7.12 worth of sunflowers after 4 days, and $12.52 worth of bouquets.

Since each sunflower costs $3, this means that 29 / 3 = 9 sunflowers were sold.\n\nSimilarly, $94 represents the amount of money made from selling bouquets. Since each bouquet contains 7 sunflowers and a bouquet costs $12, this means that 94 / 12 = 7.75 bouquets were sold. Multiplying this by 7, the number of sunflowers in each bouquet, results in 54.25 sunflowers being sold.\n\nAdding together the 9 sunflowers sold from the individual sales and the 54.25 sunflowers sold from the bouquet sales gives us a total of 63.25 sunflowers sold. Since this number cannot be a fraction, the closest whole number would be 63.

If Faraday can earn 7*$12=$84 from selling 7 bouquets, he can make 7*$3=21 dollars from 7 flowers. So, if he can sell all 29 flowers as bouquets and the rest as individual flowers, he would have made $84+21=$105 from them. We know that he made $29 from the individual flowers and $94 from the bouquets. This means that he earned $105-$29-$94=12 from the bouquets. One bouquet cost $12. Since he made $12, this means that he sold $\\frac{12}{12}=1$ bouquets. Since each bouquet contains 7 flowers, he sold 7*1=7 flowers. Let's check the answer using the original information. According to the hint, we know that each bouquet contains 7 flowers. Therefore, we can make 7 dollars from each bouquet, which means that he could sell $\\frac{94}{7}=13$ bouquets. Since each bouquet contains 7 flowers, he would have sold 7*13=91 flowers. We also know that he sold 29 flowers individually. This adds up to 91+29=120 flowers.
