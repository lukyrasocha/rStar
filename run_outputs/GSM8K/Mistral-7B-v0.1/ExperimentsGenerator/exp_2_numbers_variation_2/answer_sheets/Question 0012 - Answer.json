Daniel is a engineering student, and Daniel wants to buy 8 notebooks, 4 pens, 1 calculator, and 1 geometry set. The shop gives a 10% discount on all the purchased items. How much does Daniel have to spend on all the items Daniel wants to buy?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "8 notebooks cost 8 x $5 = $<<8*5=40>>40.\n4 pens cost 4 x $1 = $<<4*1=4>>4.\nThe total cost is $40 + $4 = $<<40+4=44>>70.\nThe total discount is 10% of $70 = $<<10*70/100=7>>7.\nTherefore, Daniel has to spend $70 - $7 = $<<70-7=63>>63 on all the items Daniel wants to buy.\n#### 63", "gold_answer": "63"}
