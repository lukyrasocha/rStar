He wants to buy 8 notebooks, 4 pens, 1 calculator, and 1 geometry set. The shop gives a 10% discount on everything.

Now let's calculate the cost of these things with the discount applied. We take our original 60 and we multiply it by one minus ten percent. Ten percent is 0.1.

First we need to find out how much Daniel spends on everything. We can calculate the price of each item. Notebook is $5, and we buy 8. That makes it $5 x 8 = $40 for notebooks. Pen is $1, and we buy 4. That makes it $1 x 4 = $4 for pens. Calculator is $13, and we buy 1. That makes it $13 for calculators. Geometry Set is also $13, and we buy 1.
