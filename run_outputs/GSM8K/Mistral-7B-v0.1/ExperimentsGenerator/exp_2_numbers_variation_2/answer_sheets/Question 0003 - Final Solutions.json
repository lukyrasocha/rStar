The problem states Jim spends 5 hours watching TV."}, "direct_answer": {"text": "To find out how many hours Jim spends on TV per day, we can use a variable. Let's say h stands for hours. Jim spends 5 hours watching TV. We can write:\n```\nh = 5\n```\nThe problem also says Jim spends half as long reading every time he goes to bed. So if it takes h hours to watch TV, it will take him h / 2 hours to read. This can be written as:\n```\nreading_time = h / 2\n```\nNow we know Jim spends 5 hours watching TV. And when he goes to bed, he spends half that amount of time reading, so 5 / 2 hours. Since he goes to bed twice a week, Jim spends 5 + (2 times 5 / 2) hours watching TV. This can be written as:\n```\nTV_time = 5 + 2 * (5 / 2)\n```\nWe can simplify this using algebra. When multiplying a fraction by another number, you can multiply the top and bottom numbers separately:\n```\nTV_time = 5 + 2 * (5 / 2)\n    = 5 + 2 * (5 / 2 * 1/1)\n    = 5 + 2 * (5/2) * (1/1)\n    = 5 + (2 * 5/2) * (1/1)\n    = 5 + 10/2 * (1/1)\n    = 5 + 5 * (1/1)\n    = 5 + 5\n    = 10\n```\nSo Jim spends 10 hours per week watching TV. Now let's figure out how much time Jim spends reading. This was calculated earlier as h / 2 hours, so:\n```\nreading_time = h / 2\n```\nSince Jim goes to bed twice a week, he spends twice as much time reading as he watches TV. So 2 times reading_time equals TV_time. This can be written as:\n```\n2 * reading_time = TV_time\n```\nSubstitute TV_time for its value above and solve for reading_time:\n```\n2 * reading_time = 10\n    reading_time = 10 / 2\n    reading_time = 5\n```\nJim spends 5 hours reading per week.
