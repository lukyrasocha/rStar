First we need to find out the number of customers who were kicked out of the Walmart for refusing to wear masks. The problem states 4 customers were kicked out of the Walmart for refusing to wear masks.\nNow there are 4 customers who were kicked out of the Walmart for refusing to wear masks. A number equals to four times that many minus 5 were kicked out for shoplifting. This means, four times the number of customers who were kicked out of the Walmart for refusing to wear masks minus 5 were kicked out for shoplifting. Let's call this number 4x. Four times x is 4x. We know it equals to 4 times the number of customers who were kicked out of the Walmart for refusing to wear masks minus 5. We can write 4x = 4(x) - 5. This means 4x = 4x - 5. We subtract 4x on both sides. The result is 4x - 4x = 4x - 4x - 5. The result is -5. We have found the number of customers who were kicked out of the Walmart for refusing to wear masks. This number is -5.\nThree times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. Let's call this number 3y. It means three times the number of shoplifters was 3y. Now we have 2 numbers: 4x and 3y. We need to combine them. We know 3y was equal to three times the number of shoplifters. We also know 4x was four times the number of customers who were kicked out of the Walmart for refusing to wear masks minus 5. What do we know about them? They are different quantities. But we want to make sure they are the same quantity. Let's try to find a common denominator. We can multiply both denominators by 3 and get 3 times y and 3 times x. Now we have: 3y = 3 times the number of shoplifters; 3x = 3 times the number of customers who were kicked out of the Walmart for refusing to wear masks minus 5. Notice that both equations have a factor of 3. We can divide by 3 on both sides of the equation. 3y / 3 = 3 times the number of shoplifters / 3; 3x / 3 = 3 times the number of customers who were kicked out of the Walmart for refusing to wear masks minus 5 / 3. The result is y = 3 times the number of shoplifters / 3; x = 3 times the number of customers who were kicked out of the Walmart for refusing to wear masks minus 5 / 3. Let's substitute these expressions into our original statement: 4x - 5 = 4 times the number of customers who were kicked out of the Walmart for refusing to wear masks minus 5. We can substitute x = 3 times the number of customers who were kicked out of the Walmart for refusing to wear masks minus 5 / 3. This results in: 4(3 times the number of customers who were kicked out of the Walmart for refusing to wear masks minus 5 / 3) - 5 = 4 times the number of customers who were kicked out of the Walmart for refusing to wear masks minus 5. We simplify this expression. (4 x 3) times the number of customers who were kicked out of the Walmart for refusing to wear masks minus 5 / 3) - 5 = 4 times the number of customers who were kicked out of the Walmart for refusing to wear masks minus 5. (4 x 3) times the number of customers who were kicked out of the Walmart for refusing to wear masks minus 5 / 3) - 5 = 4 times the number of customers who were kicked out of the Walmart for refusing to wear masks minus 5. 12 times the number of customers who were kicked out of the Walmart for refusing to wear masks minus 5 / 3) - 5 = 4 times the number of customers who were kicked out of the Walmart for refusing to wear masks minus 5.
