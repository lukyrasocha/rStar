First, we need to find out what fraction of the questions they needed to answer correctly to pass. It says you need to answer 71% of the questions correctly. So we divide by 100 and multiply it by the percent of answers you answered correctly to get the fraction. Then we can multiply this fraction by the number of questions in the first test to see how many questions they need to answer correctly to pass. The second part asks how many questions they need to answer correctly in the second test to pass. We could use the same process as before but using the new information about the second test. We start with finding the percentage that will allow them to pass the second test. You must answer 71% of the questions correctly. Divide 71 by 100 and multiply by 100, and we get 0.71. This represents the fraction of questions they would need to answer correctly to pass the second test. Multiplying this fraction by the number of questions they had in the second test allows us to determine how many questions they needed to answer correctly. Since they only got 56% correct in the first test, we need to figure out how many more questions they need to get correct to pass the second test. Multiplying 56 by the number of questions in the first test tells us how many questions they already got correct. To find the number of questions that they still need to get correct, we subtract the number they already got correct from the total number of questions in the second test. This leaves us with the number of questions they needed to get correct on the second test. When we do this, we find that we need to get 71% of 30 questions correct to pass. This means that we need to get 30 x 0.71 = 21.3 questions correct. Since we cannot answer a fraction of a question, we need to round up to 22 questions to ensure we pass the second test.
