Let's think step by step. The pants cost half of the jacket and hat together. So if we know the jacket cost, we can find the pants cost. Since the average of the cost of the hat and jacket is the same as the pants, it follows that the jacket cost is the average of the hat and pants. That means the pants and jacket cost the same. To figure out the pants cost, we need to solve for the average of the jacket and pants, which is the same as the average of the hat and jacket. We already know the hat cost, so the jacket cost is 3 times the hat cost. Using these values, we can find the pants cost. Let's try substituting in the hat cost into this formula: ((3 * 39) + pants_cost) / 2 = 39. This gives us pants_cost = (3 * 39) - 39 = 117 - 39 = 78. The total cost of the uniform is jacket cost + pants cost + hat cost = 3 * 39 + 78 + 39 = 3 * 39 + 2 * 39 = 6 * 39 = 39 * 6 = 234.

That means we can write the following equations: 39 = x, 3x = y, and (x+y)/2 = z, where z is the price of the pants. We can solve for y as follows: 3x = y, so y = 3x; and z = (x+y)/2, so z = (x+3x)/2 = 4x/2 = 2x. We can solve for x as follows: 39 = x, so x = 39; and y = 3x, so y = 3(39) = 117.
