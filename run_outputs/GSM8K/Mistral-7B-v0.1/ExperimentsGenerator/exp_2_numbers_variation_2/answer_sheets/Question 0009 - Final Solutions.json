Let x be the number of people who were kicked out for shoplifting. Then, we have 4x - 5 = x(4) - 5. Since the number of people who were kicked out for shoplifting is equal to 4 times that many, we can substitute 4x for x(4).

This means they were kicked out for that reason. 4 customers is 4 masks. Then, there were 4 x - 5 people who were kicked out for shoplifting. This means the number of shoplifters is 4 x - 5. Because the number of shoplifters is equal to three times the number of those who were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale, the number of those who were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale is 3 x (4 x - 5). This means there were 3 x (4 x - 5) people who were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. Next, we need to calculate the total number of people who were kicked out of the Walmart. To do this, we add up all the numbers of people who were kicked out for different reasons. 4 + (4 x - 5) + 3 x (4 x - 5) = 4 + 4 x - 5 + 3 x 4 x - 5. We simplify this equation to get 4 + 4 x - 5 + 3 x 4 x - 5 = 4 x - 5 + 4 x - 5 + 12 x - 15. We combine like terms to get 4 + 4 x - 5 + 3 x 4 x - 5 = 4 x - 5 + 4 x - 5 + 12 x - 15 = 16 x - 20. So, the total number of people who were kicked out of the Walmart was 16 x - 20. Since the total number of people who were kicked out of the Walmart is 48, we get 16 x - 20 = 48. We simplify this equation to get 4 x - 3 = 3. Finally, we subtract 3 from both sides to get 4 x - 3 - 3 = 3 - 3. We simplify this equation to get 4 x - 6 = 0. We divide both sides by 4 to get 4 x - 6 \u00f7 4 = 0 \u00f7 4. We simplify this equation to get x - 6 \u00f7 4 = 0 \u00f7 4. We divide both sides by 6 \u00f7 4 = 0 \u00f7 4 to get x - 6 \u00f7 4 = 0 \u00f7 4 \u00f7 6 \u00f7 4. We simplify this equation to get x = 0 \u00f7 4 \u00f7 6 \u00f7 4.

We can start with the total number of people who were kicked out: 48. Let this number be denoted as N. We know that 4 customers were kicked out for not wearing masks.

Four times this original number is 4N + 5. This is because five people were also kicked out for shoplifting. So 4N + 5 is the total number of people kicked out for refusing to wear masks or for shoplifting. But then three times the number of shoplifters were also kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. So, 3 times the number of shoplifters is equal to 4N + 5. And therefore the total number of people who were kicked out for any reason is equal to 3(4N+5). We can rewrite 3(4N+5) as (3*4)*N+(3*5), which simplifies to 12N+15. Since we know the total number of people kicked out is 48, we get 48=12N+15. And this can be solved for N, which equals to 2. This tells us that 2N was the original number of people kicked out.

I'm going to focus on one equation at a time. To determine the number of people who were kicked out for refusing to wear masks, we need to solve the first equation. Four times that many minus 5 was equal to 48. So let's try subtracting 5 from both sides of this equation. We get four times that many minus 5 minus 5. So let's try multiplying both sides of this equation by four. We get four times that many minus 5 times 4. That's 4 times that many minus 20. Let's subtract 20 from both sides of this equation again. We get 4 times that many minus 20 minus 20. So let's try multiplying both sides of this equation by four. We get 4 times that many minus 20 times 4. That's 4 times that many minus 80. The solution is 4 times that many equals 85. So the number of people who were kicked out for refusing to wear masks is 85 divided by 4. This is 21.5. I can round up to make it 22. Next, let's go back to the second equation. The number of people who were kicked out for shoplifting equals three times that number minus 5. So let's start by dividing both sides of this equation by three. We get that number minus 5 divided by three. Let's multiply both sides of this equation by three. We get three times that number minus 5 times 3. That's three times that number minus 15. Let's add 15 to both sides of this equation. We get three times that number minus 15 plus 15. So let's try multiplying both sides of this equation by three. We get three times that number minus 15 times 3. That's three times that number minus 45. So the solution is that number equals 45 divided by 3. This is 15. Next, let's go back to the third equation. The number of people who were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale equals three times that number. So let's start by dividing both sides of this equation by 3. We get that number divided by 3. Let's multiply both sides of this equation by 3. We get three times that number times 3. That's three times that number times 3.

So we need to solve for x: 5 + 4x = x. 4x - x = 5. 3x = 5. x = 5/3. 5/3 plus 4 times the number of people was kicked out for shoplifting. So the shoplifters were kicked out for 5/3 plus 4 times the number of people. We can write this as x + 5/3.

Because we found out that 4x is 29 and 4x minus 5 is the number of people who were kicked out for shoplifting, we can calculate the number of people who were kicked out for shoplifting. 29 minus 5 is 24. The number of people who were kicked out for shoplifting is 24. Now let's look at the last part of the problem. Three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. So 3 times the number of people who were kicked out for shoplifting, or 3 times 24 is the number of people who were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. 3 times 24 is 72. The number of people who were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale is 72. The number of people who were kicked out for other reasons is 48 minus 4 minus 24 minus 72, which is 2.

If the number of people kicked out for shoplifting was equal to 4 times the number of people kicked out for not wearing masks minus 5, then we need to find the number of people kicked out for not wearing masks first. Since there were four customers kicked out for not wearing masks, this means that the number of people kicked out for shoplifting would be 4 times the number of people kicked out for not wearing masks minus 5. To find the number of people kicked out for not wearing masks, we need to add 5 to the number of people kicked out for shoplifting. Adding 5 to the number of people kicked out for shoplifting gives us the number of people kicked out for not wearing masks. Then, we multiply the number of people kicked out for not wearing masks by 4 to get the number of people kicked out for shoplifting.

The problem states 4 customers were kicked out of the Walmart for refusing to wear masks."}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's think step by step. First we need to find out the number of customers who were kicked out of the Walmart for refusing to wear masks. The problem states 4 customers were kicked out of the Walmart for refusing to wear masks.\nNow there are 4 customers who were kicked out of the Walmart for refusing to wear masks. A number equals to four times that many minus 5 were kicked out for shoplifting. This means, four times the number of customers who were kicked out of the Walmart for refusing to wear masks minus 5 were kicked out for shoplifting. Let's call this number 4x. Four times x is 4x. We know it equals to 4 times the number of customers who were kicked out of the Walmart for refusing to wear masks minus 5. We can write 4x = 4(x) - 5. This means 4x = 4x - 5. We subtract 4x on both sides. The result is 4x - 4x = 4x - 4x - 5. The result is -5. We have found the number of customers who were kicked out of the Walmart for refusing to wear masks. This number is -5.\nThree times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. Let's call this number 3y. It means three times the number of shoplifters was 3y. Now we have 2 numbers: 4x and 3y. We need to combine them. We know 3y was equal to three times the number of shoplifters. We also know 4x was four times the number of customers who were kicked out of the Walmart for refusing to wear masks minus 5. What do we know about them? They are different quantities. But we want to make sure they are the same quantity. Let's try to find a common denominator. We can multiply both denominators by 3 and get 3 times y and 3 times x. Now we have: 3y = 3 times the number of shoplifters; 3x = 3 times the number of customers who were kicked out of the Walmart for refusing to wear masks minus 5. Notice that both equations have a factor of 3. We can divide by 3 on both sides of the equation. 3y / 3 = 3 times the number of shoplifters / 3; 3x / 3 = 3 times the number of customers who were kicked out of the Walmart for refusing to wear masks minus 5 / 3. The result is y = 3 times the number of shoplifters / 3; x = 3 times the number of customers who were kicked out of the Walmart for refusing to wear masks minus 5 / 3. Let's substitute these expressions into our original statement: 4x - 5 = 4 times the number of customers who were kicked out of the Walmart for refusing to wear masks minus 5. We can substitute x = 3 times the number of customers who were kicked out of the Walmart for refusing to wear masks minus 5 / 3. This results in: 4(3 times the number of customers who were kicked out of the Walmart for refusing to wear masks minus 5 / 3) - 5 = 4 times the number of customers who were kicked out of the Walmart for refusing to wear masks minus 5. We simplify this expression. (4 x 3) times the number of customers who were kicked out of the Walmart for refusing to wear masks minus 5 / 3) - 5 = 4 times the number of customers who were kicked out of the Walmart for refusing to wear masks minus 5. (4 x 3) times the number of customers who were kicked out of the Walmart for refusing to wear masks minus 5 / 3) - 5 = 4 times the number of customers who were kicked out of the Walmart for refusing to wear masks minus 5. 12 times the number of customers who were kicked out of the Walmart for refusing to wear masks minus 5 / 3) - 5 = 4 times the number of customers who were kicked out of the Walmart for refusing to wear masks minus 5.

A number equals to four times that many minus 5 were kicked out for shoplifting. We can write this as 4m - 5 = y, where y is the number of shoplifters. To get rid of m, we need to divide both sides by 4. We obtain 1/4m - 5/4 = y/4. Let's call y/4 x, where x is the number of shoplifters. Solving for x, we obtain x = y/4 + 5/4. A total of 48 people were kicked out of the Walmart. To solve for y, we can multiply both sides of the equation 4m - 5 = y by 4, and then add 5 to both sides to obtain 4m = 5y + 5. Replacing y by 4x + 5 yields 4m = 5(4x + 5) + 5 or 4m = 20x + 25 + 5, or m = 5x + 3, where m represents the number of customers who were kicked out for shoplifting. Now we know that 3x + 7/4 = z, where z represents the number of people who were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. Since 4x + 5 = y, we can replace x by (4y - 5)/4 to obtain 3(4y - 5)/4 + 7/4 = z. Simplifying yields 3y - 5 + 7/4 = z. Multiplying by 4 yields 12y - 20 + 7 = 4z, or 12y = 4z + 20 - 7 = 4z + 13.
