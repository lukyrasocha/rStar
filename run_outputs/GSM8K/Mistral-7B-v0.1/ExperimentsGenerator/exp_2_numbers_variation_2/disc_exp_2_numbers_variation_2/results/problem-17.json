Aside having mentioned earlier regarding safety concerns around road conditions here let us consider next point.....Driving times may also differ due additional reasons such as traffic congestion along highways; slow down zones within major city centers might apply thus adding extra mileage beyond simple calculation estimates based solely upon straight line calculations using standard vehicle parameters alone..
