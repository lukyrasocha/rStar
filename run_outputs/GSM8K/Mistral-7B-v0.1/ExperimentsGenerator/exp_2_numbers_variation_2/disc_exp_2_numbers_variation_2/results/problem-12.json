Substituting actual values results (($5*.08)+($1.*4))+$13+(another)$13 which equals [$<<5*.08=0.4>>] . And so without considering sales discount it equates to ($0.4+$4+$13+$13=$ <<0.4+4+13+13=29.4=dollars>>). When we apply the promotional offers like 'Buy More Get less', the customer only needs pay half off when buying minimum six pencils hence [[(($4)/2)==]]$.

Since the store offers a 10% discount on everything, calculate this amount as well ($60 * 0.1). That comes out to $6. Thus subtracting this value from your initial price yields the actual expense you would need to pay; so, $60 - $6 results into what Daniel needs to use when buying those things namely $54.

Lastly, since the store offers him a special deal -- a flat 10% off regardless of what else you purchase --- , Daniel would get additional savings worth 10% less than the actual spent amount; essentially getting a reduction equivalent to $.1*price_of_items=$6 ($6 being ten percent of the entire initial calculated expense of $60.).

First calculate what the value of the 10% percentage reduction actually amounts to when applied onto the original price ($69).

To sum everything up prioritizing these values yields $40+$4+=$<<40+4+13=57>>57 .

Finally calculate the combined price without any sales promotion applied (no special prices such as clearance, rebate coupons etc.). We first add together the costs using those unit rates which get us \\(((5\\cdot 8)+(1\\cdot 4)+\\dotsc) +\\$ ((5+1)\\times n)\\) .

Use exponentiation instead because exponential functions describe nonlinear relationships very nicely \u2014 but also avoid unnecessary complication : let's use power rule $(\\sqrt y)^r=(yd)^{r/2}=yz^{r/2}$. This equation implies that raising either side of both sides separately results directly into multiplying exponentials according too laws known under mathematic term \u201dexponential growth rate\u201d. Thus our base becomes just three variables times squared terms raised upwards till reach four dimensions space dimension !!! That way makes easier computations over long ranges ; hence why physicists call them generalizations named series expansions ---for example imagine counting points inside spherical shell surface area surfaces through integrals called calculus methods ).

        " the calculator is $13. Each geometry set costs $13. There is also just one geometry set, which means its price remains constant as well \u2013 this comes out to be simply $13. To find the grand total before any deductions we add up prices together using addition; i.e., Grand Total (T) equals Sum Of Individual Totals Or Simply T = Cost_notebooks+Cost_pens+Cost_calculator+Cost_geometreyset Which simplifies down into our solution methodology. Hence bringing us closer towards solving part B & C Let\u2019s get back focused onto Part b). Using what was derived above lets begin calculating it further\u2026 Here goes:- Firstly let\u2019s calculate \u2018Sum of individual totals or individually known amounts(i)*(-)(ii)- We already know values like following : Calculation I= Notebookscost*Quantitywhich translates mathematicallyto ;Calculate cost multipliedwithquantityofiteminquestionforinstanceweknowthatits$5andtheamountisalsobeingsevensoour calculation turnsoutintofollowingtrivialmathequationxDividingthisaboveexpressionthroughcommondenominatoryieldstheevaluatedanswer:$CALCULATION II:=Penspentortotalpencost*$numberoffensesinesuchcaseletsusnowacknowsomeotherwaybetohavemostvaluablenumbersdonepreciselyasbellowusingactualnumberstowiththenumberofitemsintotalhereequals4$\\therefore\\;\\;Notebooks\\;Total=\\;\\color{",
        " = $4. Each item (a calculator or a geometry set) costs $13. Since both the calculator and the geometry sets together would make up ($13+$13)x=($26). Add these three amounts which totals $(40+4+26)=$60 as total spending without any discount. With applying this 10% off, amount paid can reduced by getting only .1(total price), so new value equals : [$(60-.1\u00d7$60)]=$(60\u2212$6=$54). Hence, we get ,Daniel needs to pay $(54 )in order purchase everything.. ",
        " cost without any discount would be $40 + $4 + $13 + $13 = $60. But we need to subtract the discount which means 10/100 or .1 times $60 equals $6. Therefore, the actual amount spent during this shopping trip was reduced by $6 so $60 minus $6 leaves us only with spending $60-$6= $54 finally. The answer is: 54.",
        " to get the amount spent which equals $70 - ($70*10/100) = $70 - $7= $63 . ",
        " the amount spent using this formula $(totalCost) \\times (1 \u2212discountRate) $. Here, we get ($70 \u00d7 .9). This comes out as being equal to $$70 \u2013 ${6} $, which equals $$\\$ 64$. "
