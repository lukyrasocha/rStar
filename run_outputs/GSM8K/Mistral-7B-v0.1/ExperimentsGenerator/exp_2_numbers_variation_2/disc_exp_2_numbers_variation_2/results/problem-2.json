Since we\u2019re asked about \u201cweekly\u201d schedules , multiply this result into seven since our base unit here uses one week as basis ; therefore : Weekly Care Time = Daily Base Unit Multiplied By Number Of Days Performed Every Year Which results to; ((Daily Basis Here Equals To )(NumberHerePerYear))=((8)(7)). Therefore, John thus expends eight times seventeen units throughout weeks..

        " look after one dog (which we determined previously as 'hours per day') times four because John looks after four dogs which equals 'daily time spent'. That value represents what john spends looking after all of them every single day. Therefore calculate this daily amount again but instead multiply it only once so you get him walking/caring these pet mammals over seven different consecutive calendar days. This results into 'weekly time spent', our final result; hence calculating according: hrs_per_dog*num_of_dogs=days_spent -> days_spent*7->hrs_pw(per week). Substituting values yields :  2*(4)=8 hr per day , multiplying those totaled eight hours per working day against 7 workable nonconsecutive weeks or periods sums up to exactly fifty six (given data constraints) hour commitments toward animal husbandry tasks within just one standard professional span year long scheduling framework including rest intervals .

Finally calculate weeks since our standard measure consists not only minutes but also seconds or years henceforth considerably greater units like 'hours.' Assuming a typical working schedule spans Monday through Friday, over fifty six workdays within any particular year yields roughly sixty three full weeks when rounded off considering leapyear exceptions. However if your perspective stretches beyond conventional boundaries towards encompassing longer temporal scopes while accounting possible disruptions interspersed evenly across those span excluding instances specifically involving public holidays nor irregular occurrences tied directly resulting consequential cessation thereby significantly abbreviating otherwise expected durations , further extrapolation would necessitate additional data inputs including specific duration ranges alongside frequency statistics pertinent both individualistically aligned entities along generalized collective patterns correlated statistically representative parameters .
