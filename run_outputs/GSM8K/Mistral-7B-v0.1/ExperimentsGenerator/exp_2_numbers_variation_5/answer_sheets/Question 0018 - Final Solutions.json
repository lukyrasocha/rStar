First, we need to find out what percentage of correct answers she needs to get overall. That would be 64% of the total number of questions. But she didn't say what the total number of questions was, so we need to figure that out. Let's call the total number of questions X. Then 64% of X would be (X * 0.64) = Y, so we can use this to find out what X should be. We know that she got 69% correct on the first test, which means (X * 0.69) = Z, but we don't know what X or Z are. However, if we solve for Y and Z, we can find out what X must be. So, we have (X * 0.64) = Y and (X * 0.69) = Z. Then, multiply both sides by (X * 0.69) and divide by Y to get: (X * 0.69) * (X * 0.64) / Y = ZY. Finally, simplify and solve for X: ((X * 0.69) * (X * 0.64)) / Y = ZY -> (0.69 * 0.64) * X^2 = ZY -> X^2 = (ZY) / (0.69 * 0.64) -> X = sqrt((ZY) / (0.69 * 0.64)). Therefore, to pass the exam, she needs to get 64% correct, which means that (ZY) / (0.69 * 0.64) = 64%, so we can plug in our values for Z and Y to find out the exact value of X. This gives us X = sqrt(Z*Y/0.69*0.64). To make sure we get a real number, let's round it up to the nearest whole number: 115. This means that she needs to answer 115 questions correctly to pass. So far we've only considered the first test, but the second test is also important. Since the first test had 68 questions, let's call the number of questions on the second test N. Then, we know that (115 * 0.64) = Y, since that's the number of questions she needs to get correct overall. Also, (N * 0.69) = Z, since that's the number of questions she got correct on the first test. So, we can use these values to find out what N must be. We have (115 * 0.64) = Y and (N * 0.69) = Z. Multiply both sides by (N * 0.69) and divide by Y to get: (N * 0.69) * (115 * 0.64) / Y = ZY. Finally, simplify and solve for N: (N * 0.69) * (115 * 0.64) / Y = ZY -> (0.69 * 115 * 0.64) * N^2 = ZY -> N^2 = (ZY) / (0.69 * 115 * 0.64) -> N = sqrt((ZY) / (0.69 * 115 * 0.64)). Therefore, to pass the exam, she needs to get 64% correct, which means that (ZY) / (0.69 * 115 * 0.64) = 64%, so we can plug in our values for Z and Y to find out the exact value of N. This gives us N = sqrt(Z*Y/0.69*115*0.64). To make sure we get a real number, let's round it up to the nearest whole number: 74. This means that she needs to answer 74 questions correctly on the second test to pass. In conclusion, to pass the exam, she needs to answer 115 questions correctly on the first test, and 74 questions correctly on the second test.

To pass 6th grade, Audrey needs to get 64% of all the questions correct. The first test has 68 questions, and Audrey got 69% correct. The second test has 35 questions.\n\nTo figure out how many questions Audrey needs to get correct on the second test to pass, let's start by figuring out how many questions she has to get correct overall. Since she already got 69% of the first test correct, she just needs to get 64% of the rest of the questions correct. We can calculate this by subtracting the number of questions in the first test from the number of questions she needs to get correct overall, and then dividing that by 100. So, 64 / 100 * (68 - 69) = 64 / 100 * -1 = -0.64.\n\nNow, since the problem doesn't specify whether or not rounding is allowed, let's assume it is. When rounded down, the result is still negative, so Audrey would need to get less than 64% of the remaining questions correct. This means that she could get up to 36% of the remaining questions wrong and still pass, as long as she gets at least 64% of the remaining questions correct.\n\nWe can calculate the number of questions she needs to get correct on the second test by taking the number of questions on the second test and multiplying it by 36%. So, 35 x 0.36 = 12.6.\n\nNow, we know that Audrey needs to get at least 64% of the remaining questions correct, but we also know that she could get up to 36% of those questions wrong and still pass. Therefore, the range of possible answers is somewhere between 64% and 36% of the remaining questions, which is equal to 64% and 36%, respectively.\n\nThe answer is that Audrey needs to get somewhere between 64% and 36% of the remaining questions correct on the second test.

We know that the number of questions they answered correctly times 64 is equal to 68 times the number of questions they answered correctly. To get rid of the number of questions they answered correctly on the left side, let's divide both sides of the equation by 64.
