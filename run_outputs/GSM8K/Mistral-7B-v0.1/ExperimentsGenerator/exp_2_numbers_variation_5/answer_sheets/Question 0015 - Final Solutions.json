Faraday earns $95 from selling sunflowers, which cost $1 each. He also earns $30 from selling a bouquet of sunflowers, which cost $10 each. Each bouquet contains 1 sunflower.\nNow let's try to calculate what Faraday could earn from selling only sunflowers. To do this, we need to know how many sunflowers he would need to sell to earn $95. We can set up an equation like this: $95 = number of sunflowers sold * $1.\nTo solve for the number of sunflowers, we can divide both sides of the equation by $1:\n$95 / $1 = (number of sunflowers sold) * ($1 / $1)\n95 = (number of sunflowers sold)\nSo, Faraday would need to sell 95 sunflowers to earn $95 from them.\nNow, since we know how much Faraday can earn from selling just sunflowers, we can use that information to find out how many bouquets of sunflowers he would need to sell to earn another $30. We can set up another equation like this:\n30 = (number of bouquets sold) * $10\nTo solve for the number of bouquets, we can divide both sides of the equation by $10:\n30 / $10 = (number of bouquets sold) * ($10 / $10)\n3 = (number of bouquets sold)\nSo, Faraday would need to sell 3 bouquets of sunflowers to earn $30 from them.\nBut we also know that each bouquet contains 1 sunflower. So, if Faraday sells 3 bouquets, then he would also be selling 3 * 1 = 3 sunflowers.\nThis means that Faraday could sell 95 sunflowers after 1 day.\nThe answer is: 95.", "value": 0.21875}}}, "rollout_id": 2}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Faraday owns a flower shop.

From hint 2 we know that each sunflower costs 1 dollar. So Faraday earns 1 dollar when he sells one sunflower. Now, Faraday sold sunflowers for $95, which means he needed to sell $95 / 1 = 95 sunflowers to make this amount of money.
