We know that there are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense, and that there is half the number of players on the special teams as there is on the defense. This means that we can use these numbers to calculate the total number of players. First, let's take the number of players on the defense and multiply it by 2 to get the number of players on the offense. Then, let's divide this number by 2 to get the number of players on the special teams. Finally, we can add all three together to get our answer. (2 * Number of Players on Defense) / 2 + Number of Players on Special Teams + Number of Players on Defense. This tells us that the total number of players is equal to 2 * Number of Players on Defense / 2 + Number of Players on Special Teams + Number of Players on Defense. Solving this equation, we find that there are (2 * Number of Players on Defense) / 2 + Number of Players on Special Teams + Number of Players on Defense = 35, so the number of players on the defense is (Number of Players on Defense) / 2 + (Number of Players on Special Teams) + (Number of Players on Defense). To find the value of Number of Players on Defense, we can simply substitute this value into the original equation. Plugging in 35 for the total number of players, we get 35 = (Number of Players on Defense) / 2 + (Number of Players on Special Teams) + (Number of Players on Defense), which simplifies to 35 = (Number of Players on Defense) + (Number of Players on Special Teams) + (Number of Players on Defense). Rearranging this equation, we find that 35 - (Number of Players on Special Teams) - (Number of Players on Defense) = (Number of Players on Defense). Since we already know that there are 35 members on the football team, this means that the number of players on the special teams and the defense must be equal to 0 and 35 respectively.

Let's calculate the number of players on the defense. If we let d represent the number of players on the defense, then, if we multiply d by 2, we get the number of players on the offense. Also, if we add d to the number of players on the special teams and multiply it by 2, we get the same value as before, which is the number of players on the offense. Let's use d to stand for the number of players on the defense. This is our equation: (d + s) * 2 = d * 2. If we solve this equation, we get d = s. So the number of players on the defense equals the number of players on the special teams. Since the problem states that there are half the number of players on the special teams as there is on the defense, it means the number of players on the defense is equal to the number of players on the special teams.
