{"id": 376, "problem": "There are 48 pupils in a class. Half of the class likes blue. One-fourth of the remaining likes green and the rest likes yellow. How many pupils like the color yellow?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "There are 48/2 = <<48/2=24>>24 pupils who like blue.\nSo, there are now 48 - 24 = <<48-24=24>>24 pupils who like either green or yellow.\nHence, 24/4 = <<24/4=6>>6 pupils like green.\nThus, 24 - 6 = <<24-6=18>>18 pupils like yellow.\n#### 18", "gold_answer": "18"}
