{"id": 1145, "problem": "Faraday owns a flower shop. He sells a sunflower that costs $1 each and a bouquet of sunflower that costs $10. If Faraday earned $95 from the sunflower and $30 from the bouquet per day, and if each bouquet has 1 sunflowers, how many sunflowers was Faraday able to sell after 1 days?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "Faraday sold $30 / $10 = <<30/10=3>>3 bouquets of sunflower.\nSo he was able to sell a total of 1 x 3 = <<1*3=3>>3 sunflowers from the bouquets.\nAnd he was able to sell a total of $95/$1= <<95/1=95>>95 Sunflowers.\nThe sum of sunflowers Faraday was able to sell is 3 + 95 = <<3+95=98>>98.\nTherefore, the total of sunflowers he sold after 1 days is 98 x 1 = <<98*1=98>>98.\n#### 98", "gold_answer": "98"}
