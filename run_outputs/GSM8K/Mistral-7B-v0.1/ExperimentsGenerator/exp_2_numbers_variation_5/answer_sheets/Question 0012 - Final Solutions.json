Daniel wants to buy 6 pens. The price of one pen is $2. So the price of the 6 pens is 6 * 2 = 12 dollars. We need to count the calculators and geometry sets as well. One calculator is priced at $12. So the price of one calculator is 12 dollars. There is also one geometry set. Its price is again $12. All together, the price of the calculator and the geometry set is 12 + 12 = 24 dollars. Adding all prices together we get the total price without any discount: 14 + 12 + 24 = 50 dollars. That is how much Daniel would have to pay, if no discount was available.

This means the price of the calculator and geometry set drops from 24 dollars to 24 * 0.9 = 21.6 dollars. Also, the price of the pens drop from 12 dollars to 12 * 0.9 = 10.8 dollars.

I am going to focus on just notebooks, pens, calculators, and geometry sets. I can call them NB, P, CALC, GEOM. Each is worth 2 dollars, 2 dollars, 12 dollars, and 12 dollars respectively. Let's see how many of these Daniel needs. Daniel needs 7 NB, 6 P, 1 CALC, and 1 GEOM. That makes 7 * 2 + 6 * 2 + 12 + 12 = 62 total. But Daniel gets a 10% discount. Since 10% of 62 is 6.2, he will have to pay only 62 - 6.2 which is 55.8. The answer is: 55.8.", "value": 0.53125}}}, "rollout_id": 1}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "A shop sells school supplies.
