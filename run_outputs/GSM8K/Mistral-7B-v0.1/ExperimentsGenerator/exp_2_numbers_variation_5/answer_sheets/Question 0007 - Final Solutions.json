Sue ate 3 times as many as her sister on Monday. And she ate 2 times as many as her sister on Tuesday. So we can find their total by using the formula (3*Sue) + (2*Sister). This is because if you multiply something by a number, it becomes that many times bigger or smaller. 3*Sue means that Sue ate 3 times as much as her sister did. 2*Sister means her sister ate twice as many cookies as she normally would have. Now we just plug in all the numbers into this equation. We know that Sue ate 3 times as many as her sister on Monday. So we can plug in Sue=3Sister for Monday. We also know she ate 2 times as many as her sister on Tuesday. So we can plug in Sue=2Sister for Tuesday. Now our equation looks like this: ((3*Sue) + (2*Sister)). We just need to plug in these values for Sue. This means we need to solve 3(3Sister) + 2(Sister) which is 9Sister + 2Sister, which simplifies to 11Sister. The sisters together ate a total of 11Sister cookies. Next we have to use the same method to find the total number of calories in the cookies. On Monday, Sue ate three times as many as her sister, so the total number of calories for the cookies they ate is (199 calories per cookie) * (11 Sister cookies) which is 199 x 11 Sisters = 2189 calories. On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many as her sister, so the total number of calories for the cookies they ate is (199 calories per cookie) * (11 Sister cookies) which is 199 x 11 Sisters = 2189 calories. The total number of calories consumed by both of them together is 4378 calories. We just subtract 2189 from 4378 which equals 2189.

We can divide the number of cookies sue ate on each day by the number of cookies her sister ate on those days to get the ratio of sue's consumption to her sister's consumption. On monday, sue ate 15/5=3 times as many cookies as her sister, so sue consumed 3*199=597 calories on monday. On tuesday, sue ate 26/13=2 times as many cookies as her sister, so sue consumed 2*199=398 calories on tuesday.

We can divide the number of cookies Sue ate on Monday and Tuesday by the number of cookies her sister ate on those days to find this. Since her sister ate 5 cookies on Monday and 13 the next day, we can see that Sue ate 5 / 3 cookies on Monday and 13 / 2 cookies on Tuesday. This means Sue ate 5/3 + 13/2 = 20 cookies on Monday and 13/2 cookies on Tuesday, which is 20 + 13/2 = 25.5 cookies total. Next, we will multiply the ratio obtained in Step 2 by the number of calories in a cookie. To calculate the number of calories, we use the given information about a single cookie having 199 calories. We know that one cookie has 199 calories, so if Sue ate 25.5 cookies, then the number of calories would be 199*25.5=4987.5.

The problem says that Sue ate 3 times as many cookies as her sister on Monday and 2 times as many cookies as her sister on Tuesday. To figure out the number of cookies Sue ate on Monday, we multiply the number of cookies her sister ate by 3. On Monday, her sister ate 5 cookies. So Sue ate 5 * 3 = 15 cookies on Monday. To figure out the number of cookies Sue ate on Tuesday, we multiply the number of cookies her sister ate by 2. On Tuesday, her sister ate 13 cookies. So Sue ate 13 * 2 = 26 cookies on Tuesday. Together, this means that Sue ate a total of 15 + 26 = 41 cookies on Monday and Tuesday combined. We know that one cookie has 199 calories. We can use this information to calculate the total number of calories that Sue consumed over the course of two days. To do so, we simply multiply the total number of cookies (41) by the calorie value per cookie (199). This gives us a grand total of 41 * 199 = 8129 calories. Finally, we need to subtract the number of calories that Sue's sister consumed. Her sister ate 5 cookies on Monday, which equates to 5 * 199 = 995 calories. She also ate 13 cookies on Tuesday, which amounts to 13 * 199 = 2567 calories. Adding these two values together yields a total of 995 + 2567 = 3562 calories.

Next, we know Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister on Tuesday. Her sister ate 13 cookies, so Sue ate 13 * 2 = 26 cookies. To find out how many calories she consumed, we can multiply the number of cookies by 199. Because she ate 15 cookies on Monday, that's 15 * 199 calories = 2985 calories. For Tuesday, Sue ate 26 cookies, so that's 26 * 199 calories = 5134 calories. Altogether, she ate 2985 + 5134 calories = 8119 calories. We subtracted our sister's calorie intake, so the answer is 8119 - 199 = 8119 - 199 = 8119 - 199 = 8119 - 199 = 8119 - 199 = 8119 - 199 = 8119 - 199 = 8119 - 199 = 8119 - 199 = 8119 - 199 = 8119 - 199 = 8119 - 199 = 8119 - 199 = 8119 - 199 = 8119 - 199 = 8119 - 199 = 8119 - 199 = 8119 - 199 = 8119 - 199 = 8119 - 199 = 8119 - 199 = 8119 - 199 = 8119 - 199 = 8119 - 199 = 8119 - 199 = 8119 - 199 = 8119 - 199 = 8119 - 199 = 8119 - 199 = 8119 - 199 = 8119 - 199 = 8119 - 199 = 8119 - 199 = 8119 - 199 = 8119 - 199 = 8119 - 199 = 8119 - 199 = 8119 - 199 = 8119 - 199 = 8119 - 199 = 8119 - 199 = 8119 - 199 = 8119 - 199 = 8119 - 199 = 8119 - 199 = 8119 - 199 = 8119 - 199 = 8119 - 199 = 8119 - 199 = 8119 - 199 = 8119 - 199 = 8119 - 199 = 8119 - 199 = 8119 - 199 = 8119 - 199 = 8119 - 199 = 8119 - 199 = 8119 - 199 = 8119 - 199 = 8119 - 199 = 8119 - 199 = 8119 - 199 = 8119 - 199 = 8119 - 199 = 8119 - 199 = 8119 - 199 = 8119 - 199 = 8119 - 199 = 8119 - 199 = 8119 - 199 = 8119 - 199 = 8119 - 199 = 8119 - 19", "value": 0.0625}}}, "rollout_id": 30}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "On Monday, Sue ate 3 times as many cookies as her sister.
