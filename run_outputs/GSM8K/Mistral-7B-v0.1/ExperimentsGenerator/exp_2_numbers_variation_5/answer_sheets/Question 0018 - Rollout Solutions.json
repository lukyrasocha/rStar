To pass 6th grade, Audrey needs to get 64% of all the questions correct. The first test has 68 questions, and Audrey got 69% correct. The second test has 35 questions.\n\nTo figure out how many questions Audrey needs to get correct on the second test to pass, let's start by figuring out how many questions she has to get correct overall. Since she already got 69% of the first test correct, she just needs to get 64% of the rest of the questions correct. We can calculate this by subtracting the number of questions in the first test from the number of questions she needs to get correct overall, and then dividing that by 100. So, 64 / 100 * (68 - 69) = 64 / 100 * -1 = -0.64.\n\nNow, since the problem doesn't specify whether or not rounding is allowed, let's assume it is. When rounded down, the result is still negative, so Audrey would need to get less than 64% of the remaining questions correct. This means that she could get up to 36% of the remaining questions wrong and still pass, as long as she gets at least 64% of the remaining questions correct.\n\nWe can calculate the number of questions she needs to get correct on the second test by taking the number of questions on the second test and multiplying it by 36%.

Therefore, the range of possible answers is somewhere between 64% and 36% of the remaining questions, which is equal to 64% and 36%, respectively.\n\nThe answer is that Audrey needs to get somewhere between 64% and 36% of the remaining questions correct on the second test.
