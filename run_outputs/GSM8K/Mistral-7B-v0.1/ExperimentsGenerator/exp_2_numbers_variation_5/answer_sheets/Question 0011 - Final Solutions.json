For example, a bus holds 66 people, while a minibus holds 29 people. We want to know how many of each kind of vehicle we need. To figure this out, we divide the amount of people that we need to transport by the amount of people that each type of vehicle holds. For example, if we need to transport 312 people, we divide it by 66 people per bus and get 4 buses. For the minibusses, we divide 312 by 29 and get 10.52 people. This means we need 11 minibusses to transport 312 people. So we need 4 buses and 11 minibusses. For the minivans, we use the same method but instead we have 3 seats per van. This means we would need to divide 312 by 3, which results in 104 vans. We don't need any vans though since we only have 8 of them available! The answer is (4, 11, 0).\n\nHint 2: Let's think about how many minivans you need. You know that one bus can hold 66 people and that one minibus can hold 29 people. You also know that you have 3 minivans that can each hold 3 people. You have to make sure that everyone who needs transportation gets it, so you need to figure out how many minivans you need. If you had 3 minivans, that could hold 3 * 3 = 9 people. Adding in your first bus, you would have 66 + 9 = 75 people. Adding another bus would add another 66 people, so now you have 141 people. Adding another minibus would add 29 people. You now have 170 people. Adding another minibus would bring you up to 208 people, which is way too high. If you add another minibus, you will go over the limit of 312 people. That means you need to find the highest multiple of 3 that is less than or equal to 312. The highest such number is 102, which means you need 102 / 3 = 34 minivans.
