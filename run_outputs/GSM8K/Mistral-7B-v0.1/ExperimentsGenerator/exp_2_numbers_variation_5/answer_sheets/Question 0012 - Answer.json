Daniel is a engineering student, and Daniel wants to buy 7 notebooks, 6 pens, 1 calculator, and 1 geometry set. The shop gives a 10% discount on all the purchased items. How much does Daniel have to spend on all the items Daniel wants to buy?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "7 notebooks cost 7 x $2 = $<<7*2=14>>14.\n6 pens cost 6 x $2 = $<<6*2=12>>12.\nThe total cost is $14 + $12 = $<<14+12=26>>50.\nThe total discount is 10% of $50 = $<<10*50/100=5>>5.\nTherefore, Daniel has to spend $50 - $5 = $<<50-5=45>>45 on all the items Daniel wants to buy.\n#### 45", "gold_answer": "45"}
