Let's find the number of people who were kicked out for shoplifting. We know that a number equals to four times that many minus 5 were kicked out for shoplifting. This number is 4 times the number of the shoplifters minus 5, or (4 times the number of the shoplifters) - 5.

The answer is 7. So the number of shoplifters was 7. Finally let's find the number of people who were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. Three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. So since the number of shoplifters was 7, 3 times 7 is 21 people were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. The answer is 21.

There were 86 people who were kicked out of the Walmart, and we already found out that there were 3 people who were kicked out for refusing to wear masks, 7 people who were kicked out for shoplifting, and 21 people who were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale.
