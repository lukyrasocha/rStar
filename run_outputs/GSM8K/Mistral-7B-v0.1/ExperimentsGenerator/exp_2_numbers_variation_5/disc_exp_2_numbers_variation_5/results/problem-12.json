As it was mentioned that the store provides its customers with a 10% off deal if anyone buys multiple items, so let\u2019s first calculate what percentage would represent this amount since such percentages relate directly or indirectly to values/prices stated above(or could affect them); namely one can say here something like \u201ca reduced rate means saving \u2013 meaning deducting part value\u201d. This deduction may differ according whether either paid price already includes VAT [and thus no need further reducing], nor sole retail prices themselves include additional charges beyond basic costs etc.. However even without knowing anything about specific cases lets simply assume average shopping experience i.e.: standard pricing situation including possible typical service fees applicable under normal circumstances during most purchasing transactions involving regular consumers engaging daily business affairs .

Since there\u2019s also a shelf fee of 10%, you need to find out what 10% off your purchase amounts too (remember, percentages represent parts per hundred). To calculate 10% of our price above just move the decimal place one space back over towards zero; instead of spending whole dollar bills ,you save cents .Thusly we reduce our original total bill down into ninety fewer fifty bucks ;this equates again moving forward leaving us only $$$45$.

Before applying any possible sales tax or deductions such purchases combined would amount up  collectively being 14+12+12 = $$[eval(14+12+12)=38]38$. However considering we need apply 10 percent off every single purchase before calculating their summed values , meaning removing ten percentage points out of thirty eight makes it equal to (38-(38*(10/100))=$34.[[Cut]]). Hence this implies that [eval((38-((38*10)/100)))=34]. Thus Danny needs twenty four dollars to finish buying everything desired..
