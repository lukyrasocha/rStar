Since none mentioned about limited capacity other than those capacities available per transporters listed above hence this value assumes full occupancy within every assigned group while disregarding potential overcrowding situations beyond stated limits thus leading towards estimated close ranges without specifying precise figure due lack data related specific constraints etc involved especially concerning seat arrangement options allowed based upon seating size variations across different models used thereby offering only rough estimations herewith depending largely further details regarding individual company rules applicable including possible reservation policy settings also taking note special factors affecting overall headcount such weather conditions safety measures accessibility accommodations availability amenity preferences needs wants requests requirements prioritizing inclusivity comfort consider public health regulations local laws custom guidelines policies standards practices normative behaviors expectations traditions culture belief systems values ethics principles morals codes conduct code law enforcement agencies compliance authorities oversight governing bodies monitoring committees assessment evaluations auditing processes document verification procedures internal control activities external assurance services quality controls reporting structures risk management strategies contingency planning crisis communication protocols emergency preparedness drills training simulations exercises scenario analysis evaluation feedback loops continuous improvement initiatives knowledge transfer sessions skill development opportunities career advancement programs performance appraisal reviews progress reports summaries deliverables outcomes achievements milestones accomplishments highlights success stories lessons learned experiences reflective practice insights gained wisdom distilled practical applications theory applied research methodologies evidence base science proven technology inventions innovations developments breakthrough discoveries paradigm shifts transformational changes revolutionize industry upend conventional ways redefine future possibilities unlock new realms frontiers horizons unknown territories explore chart undiscovered lands navigate pioneer unchartered waters steer course set sail embark journey voyage adventure expedition trek odyssey quests quest fulfill destiny reach goals realize dreams attain aspirations",
