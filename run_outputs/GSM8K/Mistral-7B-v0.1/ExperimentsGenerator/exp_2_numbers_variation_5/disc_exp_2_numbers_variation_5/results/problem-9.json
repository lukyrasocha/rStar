To achieve this figure take into account all categories included above plus subtraction due to overlap caused when one category shares members already counted previously thus removing these duplicates leaves only non duplicate quantities add them together yield your desired count as per statement implication hence it implies addition involving three previous groups values i.e;  3(people denied entry)+7(shoplifter punishments)-overlap+x=total bans imposed This equation assumes certain shared membership numbers among groupings but considering general scenario ignoring such case assumption leads overall simpler computation without having negative counts leading toward logical inconsistency therefore following standard procedure avoids potential ambiguities leaving solely positive outcome figures based purely upon individual behaviours mentioned earlier translating directly onto possible consequences arising thereto according provided metrics ultimately arrives calculation revealing surprising result indicating unprecedented store discipline measures ensuring compliance regardless customer inclinations present contrastingly rigid enforcement rules seem highly beneficial however may instigate public debates concerning perceived authoritative stance employed against shoppers especially innocent ones caught up involuntarily falling victim similar circumstances raised numerous ethical concerns questionable legal ramifications perhaps causing unfavorable media attention potentially impacting sales adversely even furthermore affecting company reputation thereby necessitating careful assessment before implementation consideration balancing firm disciplinary actions promoting respectful order versus excessive hard line approach damaging relationships necessary maintain business operations vital success strategic planning critical corporate policy development consultancy firms often hired provide expertise evaluate pros cons scenarios assist decision making enforce laws fairly protect rights ensure safe environment consider community relations influence buyer confidence safeguard shareholder interests promote healthy economy sustain economic growth address societal expectations establish trust foster cooperation collaborate solve problems creatively build partnerships enhance competitive edge remain vigilant adapt constantly evolving market trends global landscape technological advancements cultural changes navigate complex challenges make informed judgement adjust tactics accordingly stay ahead competition stand proud uphold excellence meet ever changing demands respond effectively resolve issues promptly facilitate constructive dialogue encourage open communication inspire innov",

Thus , if you consider all possible categories mentioned here combined altogether into single figure representation excluding specific cases like nonconformity etc., ultimately reducing down upon common denominators shared among different segments thus yielding distinct numerical identifications related specifically towards individual behaviors exhibited within similar scenarios involving collective entities under circumstances defined primarily via interaction dynamics rather than external influences per se \u2013 resulting consonance achieved through mathematical simplification processes applied toward aggregation procedures hence enabling facilitated computational analysis aimed chiefly directed towards comprehensive evaluation methodologies designed explicitly suited aptly adapted according contextual constraints imposed inherently ingrained throughout investigatory efforts devoted exclusively concerned attributory causality assessments conducted subsequently systematically synthesized analytically derived interpretations furnished accordingly thereby conclusively satisfying intended evaluative objectives predicated fundamentally resting solely otherwise directly linked empirical evidence collated sequentially gathered incrementatively accumulated holistically processed cumulatively critiqued rigorously cross verifying meticulously integrated consistencies benchmarked universally validated unequivocally upheld unassailable truth principles governed implicitly dictate established normativemethodological standards mandatorily regulation compliant abiding consensually agreedupon accepted widely acknowledged legitimization precedentsetting protocol sanctified statutorily ratified vetted thoroughly reviewed judicially justifiable legally entrenched codified formally institutionalised societal canon consecrated customarily practiced routinely administered ritual precept adherence obligatory duty faithfully executed invariably honored perpetuated preserved sustained fortified continually reinforced steadfast vigilantly maintained dutifully observed respectfully esteemed firmly held confidential secure safeguarded carefully guarded zealous defended vigorously champion advocacy ardently promoted ceaselessly endeavor relentlessly pursued vehemently resisted courageously confronted boldly challenged valiantly opposed resolutely contested decis",

It would equal those disallowed based on noncompliance relating specifically towards their action of stealing merchandise present within premises [shoplifting]. Since these actions happened multiple times throughout different episodes/instances rather than just one occurrence during any particular instance etc., multiply accordingly i.e.: Numerically speak further denotes exactly what was asked , hence when referring again back onto previous statements mentioning someone thrice being deemed unacceptable herein results in subtractive reduction applied afterwards .
