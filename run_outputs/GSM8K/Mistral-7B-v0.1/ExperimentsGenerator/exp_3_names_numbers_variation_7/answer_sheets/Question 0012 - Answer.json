John is a engineering student, and John wants to buy 9 notebooks, 4 pens, 1 calculator, and 1 geometry set. The shop gives a 10% discount on all the purchased items. How much does John have to spend on all the items John wants to buy?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "9 notebooks cost 9 x $1 = $<<9*1=9>>9.\n4 pens cost 4 x $2 = $<<4*2=8>>8.\nThe total cost is $9 + $8 = $<<9+8=17>>40.\nThe total discount is 10% of $40 = $<<10*40/100=4>>4.\nTherefore, John has to spend $40 - $4 = $<<40-4=36>>36 on all the items John wants to buy.\n#### 36", "gold_answer": "36"}
