To calculate the total time that it would take Thomas to travel the entire distance if he maintains his current average speed, we multiply the total distance by the proportion of time that Thomas has covered so far. In other words, multiply 4400 km by the number of hours Thomas has traveled divided by the total number of hours he would need to travel to cover the whole distance. So, 4400 km * (number of hours Thomas has traveled / total number of hours) = percentage of distance covered. Plugging in the values we know, we can solve for the percentage of distance covered. The number of hours Thomas has traveled is 2 days * 24 hours per day = 48 hours. The total number of hours needed to travel the entire distance is 48 hours.
