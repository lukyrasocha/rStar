{"id": 1145, "problem": "Donald owns a flower shop. He sells a sunflower that costs $5 each and a bouquet of sunflower that costs $2. If Donald earned $45 from the sunflower and $81 from the bouquet per day, and if each bouquet has 7 sunflowers, how many sunflowers was Donald able to sell after 6 days?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "Donald sold $81 / $2 = <<81/2=40.5>>40.5 bouquets of sunflower.\nSo he was able to sell a total of 7 x 40.5 = <<7*40.5=283.5>>283.5 sunflowers from the bouquets.\nAnd he was able to sell a total of $45/$5= <<45/5=9>>9 Sunflowers.\nThe sum of sunflowers Donald was able to sell is 283.5 + 9 = <<283.5+9=292.5>>292.5.\nTherefore, the total of sunflowers he sold after 6 days is 292.5 x 6 = <<292.5*6=1755>>1755.\n#### 1755", "gold_answer": "1755"}
