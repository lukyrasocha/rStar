{"id": 1235, "problem": "Thomas is traveling on the interstate at an average speed of 66 km/hr (taking into account all the necessary stops for gas, relaxation, etc.). If Thomas goes on like this for 2 days, and the distance between Alaska and Texas is 4400 km, what percentage of this distance has Thomas covered?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "There are 24 hours in each day, so Thomas has been traveling for a total of 2 * 24 = <<2*24=48>>48 hours.\nAt a rate of 66 km/hr, Thomas has covered 66 * 48 = <<66*48=3168>>3168 km.\n3168 km as a percentage of 4400 km is (3168/4400)*100% = <<(3168/4400)*100=72>>72%\n#### 72", "gold_answer": "72"}
