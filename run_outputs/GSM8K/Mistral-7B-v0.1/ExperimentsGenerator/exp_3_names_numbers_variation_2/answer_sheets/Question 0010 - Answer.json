{"id": 376, "problem": "There are 72 pupils in a class. Half of the class likes blue. One-fourth of the remaining likes green and the rest likes yellow. How many pupils like the color yellow?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "There are 72/2 = <<72/2=36>>36 pupils who like blue.\nSo, there are now 72 - 36 = <<72-36=36>>36 pupils who like either green or yellow.\nHence, 36/4 = <<36/4=9>>9 pupils like green.\nThus, 36 - 9 = <<36-9=27>>27 pupils like yellow.\n#### 27", "gold_answer": "27"}
