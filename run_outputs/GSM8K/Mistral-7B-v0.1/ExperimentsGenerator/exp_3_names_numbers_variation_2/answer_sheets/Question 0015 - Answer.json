{"id": 1145, "problem": "Steven owns a flower shop. He sells a sunflower that costs $2 each and a bouquet of sunflower that costs $5. If Steven earned $55 from the sunflower and $45 from the bouquet per day, and if each bouquet has 7 sunflowers, how many sunflowers was Steven able to sell after 2 days?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "Steven sold $45 / $5 = <<45/5=9>>9 bouquets of sunflower.\nSo he was able to sell a total of 7 x 9 = <<7*9=63>>63 sunflowers from the bouquets.\nAnd he was able to sell a total of $55/$2= <<55/2=27.5>>27.5 Sunflowers.\nThe sum of sunflowers Steven was able to sell is 63 + 27.5 = <<63+27.5=90.5>>90.5.\nTherefore, the total of sunflowers he sold after 2 days is 90.5 x 2 = <<90.5*2=181>>181.\n#### 181", "gold_answer": "181"}
