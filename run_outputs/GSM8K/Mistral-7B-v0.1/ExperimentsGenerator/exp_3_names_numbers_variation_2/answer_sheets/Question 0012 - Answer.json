Charles is a engineering student, and Charles wants to buy 6 notebooks, 18 pens, 1 calculator, and 1 geometry set. The shop gives a 7% discount on all the purchased items. How much does Charles have to spend on all the items Charles wants to buy?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "6 notebooks cost 6 x $5 = $<<6*5=30>>30.\n18 pens cost 18 x $2 = $<<18*2=36>>36.\nThe total cost is $30 + $36 = $<<30+36=66>>100.\nThe total discount is 7% of $100 = $<<7*100/100=7>>7.\nTherefore, Charles has to spend $100 - $7 = $<<100-7=93>>93 on all the items Charles wants to buy.\n#### 93", "gold_answer": "93"}
