{"id": 376, "problem": "There are 96 pupils in a class. Half of the class likes blue. One-fourth of the remaining likes green and the rest likes yellow. How many pupils like the color yellow?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "There are 96/2 = <<96/2=48>>48 pupils who like blue.\nSo, there are now 96 - 48 = <<96-48=48>>48 pupils who like either green or yellow.\nHence, 48/4 = <<48/4=12>>12 pupils like green.\nThus, 48 - 12 = <<48-12=36>>36 pupils like yellow.\n#### 36", "gold_answer": "36"}
