Andrew is a engineering student, and Andrew wants to buy 7 notebooks, 13 pens, 1 calculator, and 1 geometry set. The shop gives a 10% discount on all the purchased items. How much does Andrew have to spend on all the items Andrew wants to buy?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "7 notebooks cost 7 x $3 = $<<7*3=21>>21.\n13 pens cost 13 x $2 = $<<13*2=26>>26.\nThe total cost is $21 + $26 = $<<21+26=47>>70.\nThe total discount is 10% of $70 = $<<10*70/100=7>>7.\nTherefore, Andrew has to spend $70 - $7 = $<<70-7=63>>63 on all the items Andrew wants to buy.\n#### 63", "gold_answer": "63"}
