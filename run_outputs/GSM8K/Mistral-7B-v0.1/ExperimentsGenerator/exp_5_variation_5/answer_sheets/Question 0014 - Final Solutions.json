We need to calculate how long it will take four turtles to cross the pacific ocean. First, let's figure out how far 3 kangaroos can travel in 18 hours. Kangaroos can go 9.17 million square km/hr. 3 times that is 9.17 x 3 = 27.51 million square km/hr. That means that in 18 hours, three kangaroos can cover 27.51 million square km. This is equal to 165 million square km divided by 3. Next, we need to figure out how fast turtles can go. Since they are moving half as fast as kangaroos, they can go 9.17 x 0.5 = 4.585 million square km/hr. That means that four turtles can cover 165 million square km in 165 / 4.585 = 36 hours.

Therefore, the amount of time taken by the turtles will be X/4 divided by the speed of the kangaroos, which we calculated earlier.

To solve for X, let's plug in the values for the speed of the kangaroos and the number of kangaroos. We know that it takes 3 kangaroos traveling at the same speed a total of 18 hours to cross the highway. That means that the distance covered by them in 18 hours is equal to the length of the highway.

We know that each kangaroo travels at 20 miles per hour. We also know that it took them 18 hours to complete the trip. Therefore, we can calculate the distance as follows:\n\nDistance = Speed * Time = 20 mph * 18 hours = 360 miles\n\nNext, we need to convert this distance into kilometers because we want to compare it with the area of the Pacific Ocean, which is measured in square kilometers. 1 mile equals 1.60934 kilometers.
