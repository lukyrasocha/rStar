Sue ate 46 / 11,500 = 0.004 times as much as her sister.\nLastly, we multiply the number of blinks per day by the ratio of times each person ate.

We know the human eye blinks approximately 4,200,000 times a year. So divide 4,200,000 by 365 to get 11,538.1363636... This means that every second, the human eye blinks once in 11,538 seconds. Next, we can calculate the amount of time Sue blinks. Since Sue blinks 4,200,000 times a year, this would be equivalent to 4,200,000 / 11,538.1363636... = 362.87135191... seconds per blink. Finally, we can calculate the amount of cookies that Sue eats. Firstly, on Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister. This would mean that Sue ate (4 * 5) = 20 cookies. On Tuesday, Sue ate 2 times as many cookies as her sister. This would mean that Sue ate (2 * 13) = 26 cookies. Overall, Sue ate (20 + 26) = 46 cookies. With these values, we can now calculate the number of calories that Sue consumed. Sue consumed 46 calories, while her sister only consumed (5 + 13) = 18 calories.
