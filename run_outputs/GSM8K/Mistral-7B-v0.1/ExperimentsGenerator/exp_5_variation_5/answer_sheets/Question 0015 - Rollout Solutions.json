Let's assume Faraday sold x sunflowers and y bouquets. For the first day, we know that he sold x sunflowers and y bouquets, so he sold (x+y) flowers. Since it cost $2 to buy one sunflower and $8 to buy a bouquet, it means (2x + 8y) = 26. The same applies for the second day, so (2x + 8y) = 56. And for the third day, (2x + 8y) = 82. This gives us the following system of equations: 2x + 8y = 26 2x + 8y = 56 2x + 8y = 82 Subtracting the first equation from the second equation results in 2x + 8y = 30. Subtracting the third equation from the second equation results in 2x + 8y = 26. Solving for x and y, we get x = 6 and y = 6. This means Faraday sold 6 sunflowers and 6 bouquets.
