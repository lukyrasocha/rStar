Let's try again together.\n\nThe sun is about 149.6 million kilometers away from the Earth. So if we divide that number by 365 days (the number of days in a year), that equals about 410,000 kilometers per day. That's pretty far! But don't worry, we can still calculate the total distance it would move over 60 days. Just multiply 410,000 by 60 and we get a whopping 24.6 million kilometers! That's a really long way!\n\nNow, let's look at the cost of buying ice cream. Each carton costs $4 and contains 15 servings of ice cream. So if we divide $4 by 15, we get $0.27 per serving. And since Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream each night, we can just multiply that cost by 60 days. That means she spends a total of $16.20 on ice cream over 60 days. That's a lot of ice cream!\n\nSo, to sum it up, Cynthia will spend a total of $16.20 on ice cream over 60 days. I hope this helps!

Since it takes the sun 1800km to travel that distance, it will take 15 x 1800 / 1 = 27000 days to finish the entire carton. Since she eats only one serving each day, it will take her 27000 days.
