Since Daniel wants to buy 5 notebooks, the total cost of all the notebooks is 5 * $1.50 = 5 * 1.5 = 7.50. We can also find the price of the pens by multiplying the price of one pen ($0.25) with the number of pens (2). That gives us 2 * $0.25 = 2 * 0.25 = 0.50. For the calculator, it is 1 * $12 = 1 * 12 = 12. And for the geometry set, it is 1 * $10 = 1 * 10 = 10. Putting this together, we get 7.50 + 0.50 + 12 + 10 = 29.50.
