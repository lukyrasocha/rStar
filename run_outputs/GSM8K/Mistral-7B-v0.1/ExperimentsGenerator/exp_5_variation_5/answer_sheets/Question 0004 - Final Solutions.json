Poppy is solving a 1000-piece jigsaw puzzle. Secondly, we calculate the number of pieces put on the board so far by Poppy and her mom. We can do this by multiplying x, which represents the number of pieces put on the board so far, by 1/4. This is because Poppy put a quarter of the pieces on the board. Similarly, we can multiply x by 1/3 to find the number of pieces put on the board by Poppy's mom. Combining these two pieces of information, we get:\n\nx/4 + x/3 = 750\n\nWe can solve this equation using algebra. Multiply both sides of the equation by 12, the lowest common multiple of 4 and 3. This gives us:\n\n(12x)/4 + (12x)/3 = 9000\n\nMultiply both sides of the equation by 3 to eliminate the fraction on the right side. This gives us:\n\n12x + (12x)/4 = 9000\n\nAdd (12x)/4 to both sides of the equation. This gives us:\n\n12x + (12x)/4 = 9000\n\nSimplify the right side of the equation. Divide both sides of the equation by 12. This gives us:\n\nx = 750\n\nFinally, we can substitute 750 into the original equation to find the number of pieces put on the board so far by Poppy and her mom. This gives us:\n\nx/4 + x/3 = 750\n\n750/4 + 750/3 = 750\n\nSolve the first term of the equation. This gives us:\n\n187.5 + 250 = 437.5\n\nSubtract the second term from both sides of the equation.
