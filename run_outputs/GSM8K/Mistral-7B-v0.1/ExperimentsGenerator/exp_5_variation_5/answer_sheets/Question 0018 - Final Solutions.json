That's 70% of 110. On the first test, she answered 60% of 70 questions. To find what percent of 70 she got correct, divide 60 by 70. That's 0.8571. Multiply it by 100 to change it into percent. So she got 85.71% correct on the first test. Since she answered correctly 85.71% of 70, that's 85.71 * 70 / 100 = 59.997 which rounds to 60. So she got 60/70, or 60%.
