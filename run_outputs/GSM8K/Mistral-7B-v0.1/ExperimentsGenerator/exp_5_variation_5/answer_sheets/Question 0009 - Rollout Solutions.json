[{"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "3 customers were kicked out of the Walmart for refusing to wear masks. A number equals to four times that many minus 5 were kicked out for shoplifting. Three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. There are 365 days in a non-leap year. If a total of 50 people were kicked out of the Walmart, how many were kicked out for other reasons?", "ost_step": {"1": "Identify the number of shoplifters. According to the question, a number equals to four times that many minus 5 were kicked out for shoplifting. So, we can write down:", "2": "Let x represent the number of shoplifters. Then, 4x - 5 = y, where y represents the number of shoplifters who were kicked out of the Walmart for shoplifting.", "3": "Solve for x by adding 5 to both sides. We get 4x = y + 5."}, "direct_answer": {"text": "There are three numbers in the equation: 4x, y, and x + 3.\n\nWe know that 4x = y + 5 and x + 3 = z, where x, y, and z represent the number of shoplifters who were kicked out of the Walmart for shoplifting, physical violence over goods on sale, and other reasons, respectively.\n\nSince 4x = y + 5 and x + 3 = z, let's solve for x. Adding 5 to both sides of the first equation and subtracting 3 from both sides of the second equation gives us: 4x = y + 5 and x = z - 3. Solving these equations for x, we get: x = (y + 5) / 4 and x = z - 3. Since x appears on both sides of these equations, we need to solve them simultaneously. Substituting x = (y + 5) / 4 into x = z - 3 gives us: (y + 5) / 4 = z - 3. Multiplying both sides by 4 gives us: 4(y + 5) / 4 = 4(z - 3). Simplifying this expression, we get: y + 5 = 4z - 12. Solving this equation for y, we get: y = 4z - 17. Finally, substituting y = 4z - 17 into the equation 4x = y + 5 gives us: 4x = 4z - 17 + 5. Solving for x, we get: x = (4z - 12) / 4 or x = z - 3.\n\nSo, the number of shoplifters who were kicked out of the Walmart for physical violence over goods on sale was equal to the number of shoplifters who were kicked out of the Walmart for shoplifting plus three. Therefore, if 50 people were kicked out of the Walmart, the number of shoplifters who were kicked out of the Walmart for other reasons was (4x - y - 5) / 3. That is to say, it was equal to four times the number of shoplifters who were kicked out of the Walmart for physical violence over goods on sale minus the number of shoplifters who were kicked out of the Walmart for shoplifting minus five divided by three. To calculate this number, we need to find the values of x, y, and z.\n\nWe can calculate the value of x as follows:\n\nWe know that 4x = y + 5 and x = z - 3. Substituting x = z - 3 into 4x = y + 5 gives us: 4(z - 3) = y + 5. Solving for y, we get: y = 4z - 17. Substituting y = 4z - 17 into 4x = y + 5 gives us: 4x = 4z - 17 + 5. Solving for x, we get: x = (4z - 12) / 4.\n\nNow we can use the value of x to calculate the value of y as follows:\n\nWe know that 4x = y + 5 and x = z - 3. Substituting x = (4z - 12) / 4 into 4x = y + 5 gives us: 4((4z - 12) / 4) = y + 5. Simplifying this expression, we get: 4z - 12 = y + 5. Solving for y, we get: y = 4z - 17.\n\nFinally, we can calculate the value of z as follows:\n\nWe know that 4x = y + 5 and x = z - 3. Substituting x = (4z - 12) / 4 into 4x = y + 5 gives us: 4((4z - 12) / 4) = y + 5. Simplifying this expression, we get: 4z - 12 = y + 5. Solving for z, we get: z = (y + 7) / 4.\n\nPutting all of this together, the number of shoplifters who were kicked out of the Walmart for other reasons was equal to (4x - y - 5) / 3 or (4((4z - 12) / 4) - (4z - 17)", "value": 0.0625}}}, "rollout_id": 0}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "3 customers were kicked out of the Walmart for refusing to wear masks.
