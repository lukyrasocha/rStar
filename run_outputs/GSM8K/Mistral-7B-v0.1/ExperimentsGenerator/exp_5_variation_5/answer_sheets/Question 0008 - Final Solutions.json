There are 105 players. The moon is 384,400 kilometers away from Earth. On offense, there are twice as many players as on defense. On defense, there are half the number of players as on special teams. Therefore, there are twice as many players on the offense as on defense. And half the number of players on the offense as on the defense. We can express this using math symbols as follows: 2 * (defense) / 2 = offense. So, defense / defense = offense / 2. Or, defense * 2 = offense. Therefore, defense is equal to offense divided by 2. Next, let's calculate offense. On offense, there are twice as many players as on defense. The number of players on defense is half the number of players on special teams. Half the number of players on special teams is equal to the number of players on the defense. We can express this using math symbols as follows: (special teams) / 2 = defense. So, special teams / 2 = defense. Therefore, special teams equals 2 * defense. This means that the number of players on special teams is double the number of players on defense. Now, let's plug all these equations into the first one, to get: 2 * (defense) / 2 = 2 * (offense / 2). Simplifying this equation, we get: defense = offense / 2 = offense / 2 / 2 = offense / 4. Now, let's replace offense with 2 * defense. This gives us: defense = 2 * defense / 4. Canceling out the denominators, we get: defense = 2 * defense / 4 = defense / 2 = defense.

There is half the number of players on the special teams as there is on the defense. Let's call the number of players on the special teams d. This means that d / 2 is the number of players on the defense. So we know that d / 2 is also equal to 2n / 2. Or, d is equal to 2n. Substituting our value of n into this equation, d is equal to 2(2n). Dividing both sides by 2, we get that d is equal to 4n. Plugging back into our second equation, we see that 4n is equal to d / 2. Dividing both sides by 4, we get that n is equal to d / 8. Since the number of players on offense is equal to 2n, we can substitute this into our first equation to solve for the number of players on offense. 2n is equal to 105. We can divide both sides by 2 to get that n is equal to 52. To find out the number of players on defense, we just need to divide the number of players on offense by 2.
