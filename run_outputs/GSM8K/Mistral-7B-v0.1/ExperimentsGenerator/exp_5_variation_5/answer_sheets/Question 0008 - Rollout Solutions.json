There are about 384,400 kilometers between earth and the moon. So the distance between earth and the moon is 384,400 km. 105 is a bit larger than 200. Half of 200 is 100. So the number of players on the offense is 2 times the number of players on the defense. Call the number of players on the offense n. The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense. Call the number of players on the special teams m. We know that the number of players on the offense is 2n and the number of players on the special teams is m. The number of players on the offense plus the number of players on the special teams is 105. 2n + m = 105. We also know that m is half of 2n. This is because the number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense. Therefore 2n / 2 = m. Or equivalently 2n = 2m. Substituting the last line into the equation we just got gives 2n + 2n/2 = 105. Or equivalently 4n/2 = 105. Dividing both sides by 4 and dividing both sides by 2 gives us n = 52.5.
