To do this, let's use the following formula: Distance in meters = Distance in kilometers x 1000 meters per kilometer. The distance between James and the sun is approximately 149.6 million kilometers. Using the formula above, we can convert this distance to meters. 149.6 million kilometers x 1000 meters per kilometer = 149.6 million meters.
