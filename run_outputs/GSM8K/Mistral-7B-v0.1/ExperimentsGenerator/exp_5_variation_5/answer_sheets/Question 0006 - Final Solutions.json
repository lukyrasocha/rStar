To solve this problem, we need to first understand the information provided in the question. According to the question, a uniform comes with a hat that costs 25, a jacket that costs three times as much as the hat, and pants that cost the average of the costs of the hat and jacket. We can also see from the question that there are 9.461 trillion kilometers in a light-year. Now let's start solving the problem. Since each uniform comes with a hat that costs 25, we know that the cost of the hat is 25. Similarly, since the jacket costs three times as much as the hat, its cost is 25 * 3 = 75. Finally, since the pants cost the average of the costs of the hat and jacket, their cost is (25 + 75) / 2 = 50. Therefore, the total cost of each uniform is 25 + 75 + 50 = 150.
