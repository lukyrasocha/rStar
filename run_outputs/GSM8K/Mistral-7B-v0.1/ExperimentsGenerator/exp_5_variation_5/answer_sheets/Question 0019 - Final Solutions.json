To answer this question we need to use some information from the text above and some basic arithmetic.

So if Louise applies a coat of varnish to 6 paintings, it will take 6 * 7 = 42 minutes to dry. Now let's calculate the time it takes to dry with the new varnish. The new varnish takes 12 minutes per painting to dry. Again, if Louise applies a coat of varnish to 6 paintings, it will take 6 * 12 = 72 minutes to dry. Finally, we can subtract the old varnish time from the new varnish time to get the extra time needed. The difference between the two times is 72 (new varnish) - 42 (old varnish) = 30 minutes.
