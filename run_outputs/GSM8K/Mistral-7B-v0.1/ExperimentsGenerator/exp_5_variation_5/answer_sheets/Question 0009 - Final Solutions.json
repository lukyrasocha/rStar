Adding 5 to both sides of the first equation and subtracting 3 from both sides of the second equation gives us: 4x = y + 5 and x = z - 3. Solving these equations for x, we get: x = (y + 5) / 4 and x = z - 3. Since x appears on both sides of these equations, we need to solve them simultaneously. Substituting x = (y + 5) / 4 into x = z - 3 gives us: (y + 5) / 4 = z - 3. Multiplying both sides by 4 gives us: 4(y + 5) / 4 = 4(z - 3). Simplifying this expression, we get: y + 5 = 4z - 12. Solving this equation for y, we get: y = 4z - 17. Finally, substituting y = 4z - 17 into the equation 4x = y + 5 gives us: 4x = 4z - 17 + 5.

Therefore, if 50 people were kicked out of the Walmart, the number of shoplifters who were kicked out of the Walmart for other reasons was (4x - y - 5) / 3. That is to say, it was equal to four times the number of shoplifters who were kicked out of the Walmart for physical violence over goods on sale minus the number of shoplifters who were kicked out of the Walmart for shoplifting minus five divided by three. To calculate this number, we need to find the values of x, y, and z.\n\nWe can calculate the value of x as follows:\n\nWe know that 4x = y + 5 and x = z - 3. Substituting x = z - 3 into 4x = y + 5 gives us: 4(z - 3) = y + 5. Solving for y, we get: y = 4z - 17. Substituting y = 4z - 17 into 4x = y + 5 gives us: 4x = 4z - 17 + 5. Solving for x, we get: x = (4z - 12) / 4.\n\nNow we can use the value of x to calculate the value of y as follows:\n\nWe know that 4x = y + 5 and x = z - 3. Substituting x = (4z - 12) / 4 into 4x = y + 5 gives us: 4((4z - 12) / 4) = y + 5. Simplifying this expression, we get: 4z - 12 = y + 5. Solving for y, we get: y = 4z - 17.\n\nFinally, we can calculate the value of z as follows:\n\nWe know that 4x = y + 5 and x = z - 3.

They were kicked out for something else that was not specified.\n\nNext, let's consider the number that equals to four times the number of shoplifters minus 5. This is because three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. To find this number, we need to first figure out the number of shoplifters. Let's call it N. Then, four times N minus 5 equals the number we're looking for. So, we can substitute N into our equation to find the value of N: 4N - 5 = X. Solving for N, we get N = (X+5)/4. Substituting this back into our original equation, we get X= 4(X+5)/4 - 5. Simplifying, we get X= (X+5) - 5. Adding 5 to both sides, we get 2X= X+5. Finally, subtracting X from both sides, we get X = 5.\n\nNow that we know the number of shoplifters is 5, we can go back to our original question about kicking people out of the Walmart. We know that three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. That means that 3 x 5 = 15 people were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. Additionally, we know that a total of 50 people were kicked out of the Walmart. We already know that there were 3 customers who were kicked out for not wearing masks, so that leaves 50 - 3 = 47 people who were kicked out for other reasons.\n\nSo, in summary, we started with 3 customers who were kicked out for not wearing masks. We determined that a number equals to four times that many minus 5 were kicked out for shoplifting, which turned out to be 5. We calculated that three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale, which turned out to be 15. We then figured out that 365 days in a non-leap year, which is equivalent to 50 people being kicked out of the Walmart. So, 47 people were kicked out for other reasons.\n\nThe answer is: 47.", "value": 0.09375}}}, "rollout_id": 23}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "3 customers were kicked out of the Walmart for refusing to wear masks.
