{"id": 376, "problem": "There are 64 pupils in a class. Half of the class likes blue. One-fourth of the remaining likes green and the rest likes yellow. How many pupils like the color yellow?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "There are 64/2 = <<64/2=32>>32 pupils who like blue.\nSo, there are now 64 - 32 = <<64-32=32>>32 pupils who like either green or yellow.\nHence, 32/4 = <<32/4=8>>8 pupils like green.\nThus, 32 - 8 = <<32-8=24>>24 pupils like yellow.\n#### 24", "gold_answer": "24"}
