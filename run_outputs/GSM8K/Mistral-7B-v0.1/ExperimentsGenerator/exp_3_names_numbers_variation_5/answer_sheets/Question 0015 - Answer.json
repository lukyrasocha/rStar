{"id": 1145, "problem": "David owns a flower shop. He sells a sunflower that costs $4 each and a bouquet of sunflower that costs $3. If David earned $42 from the sunflower and $8 from the bouquet per day, and if each bouquet has 6 sunflowers, how many sunflowers was David able to sell after 8 days?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "David sold $8 / $3 = <<8/3=2.6666666666666665>>2.6666666666666665 bouquets of sunflower.\nSo he was able to sell a total of 6 x 2.6666666666666665 = <<6*2.6666666666666665=16>>16 sunflowers from the bouquets.\nAnd he was able to sell a total of $42/$4= <<42/4=10.5>>10.5 Sunflowers.\nThe sum of sunflowers David was able to sell is 16 + 10.5 = <<16+10.5=26.5>>26.5.\nTherefore, the total of sunflowers he sold after 8 days is 26.5 x 8 = <<26.5*8=212>>212.\n#### 212", "gold_answer": "212"}
