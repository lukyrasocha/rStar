Robert is a engineering student, and Robert wants to buy 2 notebooks, 3 pens, 1 calculator, and 1 geometry set. The shop gives a 20% discount on all the purchased items. How much does Robert have to spend on all the items Robert wants to buy?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "2 notebooks cost 2 x $1 = $<<2*1=2>>2.\n3 pens cost 3 x $2 = $<<3*2=6>>6.\nThe total cost is $2 + $6 = $<<2+6=8>>35.\nThe total discount is 20% of $35 = $<<20*35/100=7>>7.\nTherefore, Robert has to spend $35 - $7 = $<<35-7=28>>28 on all the items Robert wants to buy.\n#### 28", "gold_answer": "28"}
