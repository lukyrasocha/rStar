{"id": 1145, "problem": "Donald owns a flower shop. He sells a sunflower that costs $5 each and a bouquet of sunflower that costs $5. If Donald earned $84 from the sunflower and $90 from the bouquet per day, and if each bouquet has 11 sunflowers, how many sunflowers was Donald able to sell after 10 days?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "Donald sold $90 / $5 = <<90/5=18>>18 bouquets of sunflower.\nSo he was able to sell a total of 11 x 18 = <<11*18=198>>198 sunflowers from the bouquets.\nAnd he was able to sell a total of $84/$5= <<84/5=16.8>>16.8 Sunflowers.\nThe sum of sunflowers Donald was able to sell is 198 + 16.8 = <<198+16.8=214.8>>214.8.\nTherefore, the total of sunflowers he sold after 10 days is 214.8 x 10 = <<214.8*10=2148>>2148.\n#### 2148", "gold_answer": "2148"}
