The first thing to note is that it says \"if each bouquet has 6 sunflowers\". This means that we can multiply the price of a bouquet ($3) by 6 to get the price of one sunflower ($3*6=$18).\n\nNext, let's look at how much money each sunflower sells for. We know that David earns $42 per day from selling sunflowers, so we can divide $42 by the price of one sunflower ($18) to find out how many sunflowers he sells per day (42/18=2).\n\nNow, let's see how many bouquets David sells per day. We know that David earns $8 per day from bouquets, and each bouquet costs $3. This means that David must sell 2.67 bouquets per day (8/3=2.67).\n\nFinally, we want to figure out how many sunflowers David sells over 8 days. To do this, we can multiply the number of sunflowers he sells per day (2) by the number of days he works (8), which equals 16.\n\nSo, overall, we can say that David sells 16 sunflowers over 8 days.", "value": 0.0625}}}, "rollout_id": 24}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "David owns a flower shop.
