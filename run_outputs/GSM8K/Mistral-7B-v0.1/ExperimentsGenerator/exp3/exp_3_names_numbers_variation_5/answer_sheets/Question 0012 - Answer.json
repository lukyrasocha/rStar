Matthew is a engineering student, and Matthew wants to buy 9 notebooks, 15 pens, 1 calculator, and 1 geometry set. The shop gives a 20% discount on all the purchased items. How much does Matthew have to spend on all the items Matthew wants to buy?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "9 notebooks cost 9 x $5 = $<<9*5=45>>45.\n15 pens cost 15 x $2 = $<<15*2=30>>30.\nThe total cost is $45 + $30 = $<<45+30=75>>110.\nThe total discount is 20% of $110 = $<<20*110/100=22>>22.\nTherefore, Matthew has to spend $110 - $22 = $<<110-22=88>>88 on all the items Matthew wants to buy.\n#### 88", "gold_answer": "88"}
