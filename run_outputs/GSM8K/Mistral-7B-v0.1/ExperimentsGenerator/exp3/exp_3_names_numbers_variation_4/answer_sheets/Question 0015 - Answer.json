{"id": 1145, "problem": "Charles owns a flower shop. He sells a sunflower that costs $3 each and a bouquet of sunflower that costs $2. If Charles earned $87 from the sunflower and $71 from the bouquet per day, and if each bouquet has 11 sunflowers, how many sunflowers was Charles able to sell after 8 days?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "Charles sold $71 / $2 = <<71/2=35.5>>35.5 bouquets of sunflower.\nSo he was able to sell a total of 11 x 35.5 = <<11*35.5=390.5>>390.5 sunflowers from the bouquets.\nAnd he was able to sell a total of $87/$3= <<87/3=29>>29 Sunflowers.\nThe sum of sunflowers Charles was able to sell is 390.5 + 29 = <<390.5+29=419.5>>419.5.\nTherefore, the total of sunflowers he sold after 8 days is 419.5 x 8 = <<419.5*8=3356>>3356.\n#### 3356", "gold_answer": "3356"}
