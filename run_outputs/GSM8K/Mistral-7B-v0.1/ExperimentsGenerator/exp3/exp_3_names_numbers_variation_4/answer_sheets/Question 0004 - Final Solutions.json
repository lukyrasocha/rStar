Margaret started with 1950 jigsaw pieces. Then she placed a quarter of the pieces, leaving three quarters of the pieces behind. Her mom placed a third of the remaining pieces. This means she placed one third of three quarters, or one ninth of the original 1950 pieces. To find the number of pieces left to be placed, we need to subtract the number of pieces placed by Margaret and her mom from the original 1950 pieces.
