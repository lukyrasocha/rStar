{"id": 376, "problem": "There are 24 pupils in a class. Half of the class likes blue. One-fourth of the remaining likes green and the rest likes yellow. How many pupils like the color yellow?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "There are 24/2 = <<24/2=12>>12 pupils who like blue.\nSo, there are now 24 - 12 = <<24-12=12>>12 pupils who like either green or yellow.\nHence, 12/4 = <<12/4=3>>3 pupils like green.\nThus, 12 - 3 = <<12-3=9>>9 pupils like yellow.\n#### 9", "gold_answer": "9"}
