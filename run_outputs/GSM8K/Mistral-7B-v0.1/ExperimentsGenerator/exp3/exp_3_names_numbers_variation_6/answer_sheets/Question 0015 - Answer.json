{"id": 1145, "problem": "Matthew owns a flower shop. He sells a sunflower that costs $1 each and a bouquet of sunflower that costs $13. If Matthew earned $76 from the sunflower and $26 from the bouquet per day, and if each bouquet has 8 sunflowers, how many sunflowers was Matthew able to sell after 2 days?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "Matthew sold $26 / $13 = <<26/13=2>>2 bouquets of sunflower.\nSo he was able to sell a total of 8 x 2 = <<8*2=16>>16 sunflowers from the bouquets.\nAnd he was able to sell a total of $76/$1= <<76/1=76>>76 Sunflowers.\nThe sum of sunflowers Matthew was able to sell is 16 + 76 = <<16+76=92>>92.\nTherefore, the total of sunflowers he sold after 2 days is 92 x 2 = <<92*2=184>>184.\n#### 184", "gold_answer": "184"}
