Robert is a engineering student, and Robert wants to buy 6 notebooks, 11 pens, 1 calculator, and 1 geometry set. The shop gives a 18% discount on all the purchased items. How much does Robert have to spend on all the items Robert wants to buy?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "6 notebooks cost 6 x $1 = $<<6*1=6>>6.\n11 pens cost 11 x $2 = $<<11*2=22>>22.\nThe total cost is $6 + $22 = $<<6+22=28>>50.\nThe total discount is 18% of $50 = $<<18*50/100=9>>9.\nTherefore, Robert has to spend $50 - $9 = $<<50-9=41>>41 on all the items Robert wants to buy.\n#### 41", "gold_answer": "41"}
