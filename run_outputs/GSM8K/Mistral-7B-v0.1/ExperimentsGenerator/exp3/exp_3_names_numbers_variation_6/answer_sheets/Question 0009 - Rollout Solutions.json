We need to identify the number of customers who were kicked out for not wearing masks and for shoplifting. From the problem statement, there are two ways to approach this problem. One way is to first identify the number of customers who were kicked out for other reasons and then subtract it from the total number of customers who were kicked out. Another way is to first identify the number of customers who were kicked out for wearing masks and then add it to the number of customers who were kicked out for shoplifting. Let's take the second approach. In the problem statement, it says that a number equals to four times that many minus 4 were kicked out for shoplifting. This means that we can write an equation like this: Number of customers who were kicked out for shoplifting = 4 x [number of customers who were kicked out for refusing to wear masks] - 4 Now, let's see what the problem statement says about three times the number of shoplifters who were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. This tells us that we can also write another equation like this: Number of customers who were kicked out for shoplifting = 3 x [number of customers who were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale] - 3 Combining these two equations, we get this: (4 x [number of customers who were kicked out for refusing to wear masks]) - 4 = (3 x [number of customers who were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale]) - 3 This can be written as follows: 4 [number of customers who were kicked out for refusing to wear masks] - 3 [number of customers who were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale] = 3 [number of customers who were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale] - 4 [number of customers who were kicked out for refusing to wear masks] Subtracting 3 [number of customers who were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale] from both sides, we get: 4 [number of customers who were kicked out for refusing to wear masks] - 4 [number of customers who were kicked out for refusing to wear masks] = 3 [number of customers who were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale] - 4 [number of customers who were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale] This simplifies to this: [number of customers who were kicked out for refusing to wear masks] = [number of customers who were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale] Since we know that a total of 45 customers were kicked out of the Walmart, we can plug in the value 45 into either of these equations to solve for the unknown quantity. Let's pick the one with [number of customers who were kicked out for refusing to wear masks] on the right hand side.
