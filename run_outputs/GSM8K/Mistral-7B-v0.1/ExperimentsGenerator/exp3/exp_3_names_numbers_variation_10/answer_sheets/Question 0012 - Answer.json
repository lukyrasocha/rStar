James is a engineering student, and James wants to buy 6 notebooks, 4 pens, 1 calculator, and 1 geometry set. The shop gives a 20% discount on all the purchased items. How much does James have to spend on all the items James wants to buy?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "6 notebooks cost 6 x $2 = $<<6*2=12>>12.\n4 pens cost 4 x $2 = $<<4*2=8>>8.\nThe total cost is $12 + $8 = $<<12+8=20>>50.\nThe total discount is 20% of $50 = $<<20*50/100=10>>10.\nTherefore, James has to spend $50 - $10 = $<<50-10=40>>40 on all the items James wants to buy.\n#### 40", "gold_answer": "40"}
