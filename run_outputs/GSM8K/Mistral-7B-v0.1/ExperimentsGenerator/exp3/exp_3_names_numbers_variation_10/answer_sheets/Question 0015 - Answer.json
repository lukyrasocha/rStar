{"id": 1145, "problem": "James owns a flower shop. He sells a sunflower that costs $6 each and a bouquet of sunflower that costs $20. If James earned $96 from the sunflower and $70 from the bouquet per day, and if each bouquet has 20 sunflowers, how many sunflowers was James able to sell after 6 days?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "James sold $70 / $20 = <<70/20=3.5>>3.5 bouquets of sunflower.\nSo he was able to sell a total of 20 x 3.5 = <<20*3.5=70>>70 sunflowers from the bouquets.\nAnd he was able to sell a total of $96/$6= <<96/6=16>>16 Sunflowers.\nThe sum of sunflowers James was able to sell is 70 + 16 = <<70+16=86>>86.\nTherefore, the total of sunflowers he sold after 6 days is 86 x 6 = <<86*6=516>>516.\n#### 516", "gold_answer": "516"}
