Since we know the number of defenders and the total number of players, we can use basic arithmetic to find the number of offensive players. Let's start by dividing the total number of players by two, since we know that there are half the number of players on the offense as there is on the defense. This gives us the number of defensive players. Then, we multiply this number by two to get the number of offensive players. So, the number of defensive players is (189 / 2 = 94.5), and the number of offensive players is (94.5 * 2 = 189)."}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's think step by step.

Thirdly, using the information from steps one and two, solve for the number of players on the defense. We know that x * 2 = number of players on the offense and y * 1/2 = number of players on the special teams. Also, the problem states that there are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense. So we can say that (x * 2) / 2 = number of players on the defense. This means that x = number of players on the defense. Plugging in what we know about x, we get (189) * (2) / (2) = 189.

Solve for y by multiplying both sides by 2 and then dividing both sides by 1/2. y = (2 * 189) / 2 = 189. Since we know there are 189 players on the entire team, this means that the number of players on the offense is 189 - y = 189 - 189 = 0. Therefore, there are no players on the offense.
