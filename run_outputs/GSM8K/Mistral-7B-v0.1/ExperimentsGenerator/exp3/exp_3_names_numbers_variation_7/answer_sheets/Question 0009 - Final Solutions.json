We know that 3 customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks, so we can replace x with 3 in the equation: 4(3) - 3 = 12 - 3 = 9. So, there were 9 customers kicked out of Walmart for shoplifting. Third, let's identify the number of customers kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. The problem states three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. We know there were 9 customers kicked out for shoplifting, so we can replace x with 9 in the equation: 3x shoplifters = 3(9) = 27. Finally, let's identify the number of people who were kicked out for other reasons.
