Michael is a engineering student, and Michael wants to buy 6 notebooks, 7 pens, 1 calculator, and 1 geometry set. The shop gives a 10% discount on all the purchased items. How much does Michael have to spend on all the items Michael wants to buy?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "6 notebooks cost 6 x $2 = $<<6*2=12>>12.\n7 pens cost 7 x $1 = $<<7*1=7>>7.\nThe total cost is $12 + $7 = $<<12+7=19>>40.\nThe total discount is 10% of $40 = $<<10*40/100=4>>4.\nTherefore, Michael has to spend $40 - $4 = $<<40-4=36>>36 on all the items Michael wants to buy.\n#### 36", "gold_answer": "36"}
