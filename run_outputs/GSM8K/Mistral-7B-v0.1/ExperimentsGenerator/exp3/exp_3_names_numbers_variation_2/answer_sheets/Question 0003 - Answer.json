{"id": 65, "problem": "Daniel spends 5 hours watching TV and then decides to go to bed and reads for half as long. He does this 5 times a week. How many hours does he spend on TV and reading in 16 weeks?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "He reads for 5/2=<<5/2=2.5>>2.5 hour a night\nSo he spends 5+2.5=<<5+2.5=7.5>>7.5 hours on these activities\nThat means he spends 7.5*5=<<7.5*5=37.5>>37.5 hours a week on them\nSo in 16 weeks, he spends 37.5*16=<<37.5*16=600>>600 hours on these activities\n#### 600", "gold_answer": "600"}
