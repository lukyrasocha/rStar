To find out how much money Faraday earned from the sunflowers and bouquets of sunflowers, we need to know how much money he earned from each of those items. The problem tells us that he earned $26 from the sunflower and $56 from the bouquet per day. We can calculate the total amount of money he earned over 3 days by multiplying the daily earnings by 3. So, Faraday earned $26 x 3 + $56 x 3 = $234. Next, we need to determine how many sunflowers were sold per day. Since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, for every bouquet sold, it contains 12 sunflowers. We can calculate the number of bouquets of sunflowers sold per day by dividing the amount of money earned from the bouquets of sunflowers by the cost of each bouquet of sunflowers, and then dividing the result by 12. Thus, Faraday sold (($56 / $8) / 12) = 3.75 bouquets per day. Therefore, over 3 days, Faraday sold 3.75 x 3 = 11.25 bouquets of sunflowers, which means that he sold 11.25 x 12 = 135 sunflowers.
