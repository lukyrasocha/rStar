First let's identify the total number of players in the football team. The problem states the team has 105 players. Next, let's identify the number of players on the offense. The problem states there are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense. We can find the number of players on the offense by multiplying the number of players on the defense by 2. That means, the number of players on the offense is 2 times the number of players on the defense. Therefore, the number of players on the offense is 2 times the number of players on the defense. Let's identify the number of players on the special teams. The problem states there is half the number of players on the special teams as there is on the defense.

That means, the number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense. Therefore, the number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense. Now, we need to find the number of players on the defense. We can find this by using what we already know about the number of players on the special teams and the number of players on the offense. Since the problem states the team recently won a local championship, that means all the players who played in the championship game must be accounted for in the final count of players on the defense. The total number of players in the team is 105. The number of players on the offense is 2 times the number of players on the defense. The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense. We can use these equations to solve for the number of players on the defense. To do this, we first solve the equation for the number of players on the special teams. We can do this by dividing both sides by 2. Then, we can solve the equation for the number of players on the offense. We can do this by multiplying both sides by 2. Finally, we can solve the equation for the number of players on the defense. We can do this by subtracting the number of players on the special teams from the number of players on the offense.
