To find what price comes down if a certain percentage (in our case 20%) applied as promotion/discount then first convert these percentages into decimals (i.e., divide them by 100). Therefore , here  80%= .8 Since multiplication applies when finding actual prices i.e apply your calculations using multiplied values you get : Total Price(after Discount) =    ($9+$14+$14+$13)*(.8)=$48*.8=$38.4 ",

Apply percentage increase which means multiplying it against its corresponding percent value here multiply price,$50*20/100=$-10; so subtracting $-10 we find out the new increased cost-$50-(-$10)=~$40 ,then sum up the individual costs based on their calculations.$40+[$1x$9]+ [$2*$7] [$1 * 1]$+[$\\frac{1}{3}*\\$13]=$$40+9+$14+\\approx$5=[\\$68 or rounded off \\$68].

However, since the store offers a 20% off discount on this purchase price as it exceeds ten dollar amount ($40 >$10). We can calculate the total bill using these steps: Step one find out what 20% of 40 means; To compute 20%, divide the original cost (let\u2019s denote this value C = 40$) by hundred or multiply by twenty over hundred because percent literally translates into \u201cper hundreds\u201d \u2013 hence you take percentage/hundred \u00d7 actual amount -> 20/100\u00d7C=0.2xC=0.2x40=$8$.

Here because this single purchase brings about no additional calculations related to quantities like before, let us calculate these alone firstly i.e., just their costs without considering those possible future reductions due to said calculated \u2018discount.\u2019 This means when computing our prices initially; we simply add them up as follows : First calculation(Notebooks):  9 Notebooks $\\times$($1/Notebook$) = ($1 \u00d7 9)/$= $$ 9 $.

Given this as our preliminary summation figure calculate its respective percentage reduction based off it\u2019s prescribed market value or worth.. Since we need only know how much exactly amount is spent , no additional calculation involving profit margins etc required here hence simply multiply both values together i.e., take the initial spending estimate(which comes about being $$40.)multiplied into percentile scale via multiplication/division operation.(i.e,$=$**forty **cents)(this means ten twenty per centage cut translates directly onto forty cents). Therefore subtract said calculated portion from above resultant accumulation thus arrives us what was actually laid down forth...

That means without any discount, Daniel would need $9 (notebook) + $14 (pens) + $14 (calculator) + $13 (geometry set) = $40. However, since there's a 20% discount on everything, we calculate this as follows: Discount amount per item equals Original Price times Discount Percentage divided by hundred which results into ($9+($14*0.2)+$14+($13*0.2))=$40*(0.2)= $8 off price altogether. Therefore subtracting it out gets us the final sum; hence Daniel spent $(40-8)=$32 when purchasing what needed during shopping trip. Thus, 'Daniel spends 32.'

Thus Daniel only pays ($40-$8)= $32 after applying the 20% discount. Hence the correct choice is : \"$32\".
