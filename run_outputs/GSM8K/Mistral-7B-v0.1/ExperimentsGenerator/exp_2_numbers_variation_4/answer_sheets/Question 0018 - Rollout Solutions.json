Next, we need to figure out the percentage of questions Audrey needs to answer correctly on the second test. 0.5 is 50%, so 63% of the total questions is 63 / 100. 0.63 * 38 = 24. Since Audrey already answered 31 questions correctly on the first test, she just needs to answer the remaining 24 questions correctly on the second test to reach the required 63%.
