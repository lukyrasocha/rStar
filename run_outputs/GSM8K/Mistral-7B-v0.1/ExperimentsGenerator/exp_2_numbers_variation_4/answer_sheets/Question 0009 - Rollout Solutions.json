First, let's find the number of people who were kicked out for shoplifting. That number equals 4 times the number of people who were kicked out for not wearing masks minus 5. So we need to solve this equation. (Number shoplifter) = 4 x (Number not mask) - 5. Let's call the number shoplifter number S and the number not mask number N. We can solve it like this. (N) * 4 - 5 = S. Now we have an equation we can solve. 4N - 5 = S. Solve for N. 4N = S + 5. Divide both sides by 4. We get N = (S + 5)/4. Now that we have N, we can use it to find the number of shoplifters. 3N equals three times the number of shoplifters. So plug in the value for N. 3(S + 5)/4. Multiply both terms in parentheses by 3. 3S + 15/4. Add 15/4 to both sides. 3S + 15 = 3(N). Divide both sides by 3. S + 5 = N. We now know that S = N - 5, so our final answer is N - 5.
