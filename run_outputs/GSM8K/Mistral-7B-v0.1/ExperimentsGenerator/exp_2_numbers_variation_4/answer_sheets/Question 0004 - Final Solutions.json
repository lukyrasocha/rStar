This problem involves a 1814-piece jigsaw puzzle. Poppy placed a quarter of the pieces on the board and her mom placed a third of the remaining pieces. To calculate the number of jigsaw pieces left to be placed, let's identify the total number of pieces. This puzzle consists of 1814 pieces. Poppy and her mom placed a certain percentage of those pieces. To determine the percentage of pieces placed by Poppy, divide 25% by 100%. That will result in 0.25. Since she placed a quarter of the pieces, this means she placed 25% of the total. Similarly, to determine the percentage of pieces placed by her mother, divide 33.33% by 100%. This gives us 0.3333. As it turns out, she placed one-third of the remaining pieces, so that means she placed 33.33% of the total pieces. Now that we know the percentages of pieces placed by Poppy and her mom, we can find the number of pieces that remain unplaced. We already established that there are 1814 total pieces. To calculate the number of pieces that remain unplaced, subtract the number of pieces placed by Poppy and her mom from the total. Subtracting 25% and 33.33% from 100%, we get 456.5 and 609.99 respectively. These represent the number of pieces placed by Poppy and her mom respectively. Therefore, (total number of pieces - percentage placed by Poppy - percentage placed by her mom) = (1814 - 456.5 - 609.99) = 747.5 pieces remain unplaced.
