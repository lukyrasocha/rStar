It costs 3 times as much as the hat, so the jacket will cost 3 * 76 = 228.\n\nFor the hat, it will cost 76. For the pants, it will cost the average of the hats and jackets. That will be (76 + 228) / 2 = 157. Since each uniform comes with one hat, one jacket, and one pair of pants, the total cost per uniform will be 76 + 228 + 157 = 461.
