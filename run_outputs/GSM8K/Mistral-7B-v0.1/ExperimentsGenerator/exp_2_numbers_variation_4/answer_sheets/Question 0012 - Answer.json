Daniel is a engineering student, and Daniel wants to buy 9 notebooks, 7 pens, 1 calculator, and 1 geometry set. The shop gives a 20% discount on all the purchased items. How much does Daniel have to spend on all the items Daniel wants to buy?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "9 notebooks cost 9 x $1 = $<<9*1=9>>9.\n7 pens cost 7 x $2 = $<<7*2=14>>14.\nThe total cost is $9 + $14 = $<<9+14=23>>50.\nThe total discount is 20% of $50 = $<<20*50/100=10>>10.\nTherefore, Daniel has to spend $50 - $10 = $<<50-10=40>>40 on all the items Daniel wants to buy.\n#### 40", "gold_answer": "40"}
