Then we know 1/4 of that number were scared away. That means 68 divided by 4 equals 17. But wait. We haven't figured out how many birds were not scared away yet! Let's find that. It's all the other birds minus the scared ones. So that's 68 minus 17 equals 51. Okay, so 51 stayed behind. And 50 came later. So there are 51 plus 50 equals 101 birds in the backyard now.
