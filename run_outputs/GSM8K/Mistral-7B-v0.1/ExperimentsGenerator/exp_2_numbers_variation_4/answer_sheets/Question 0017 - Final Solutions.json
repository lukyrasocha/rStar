First, let's find the total amount of time it took to get from one place to the other. This is the same as asking \"how long will it take me to go from point A to point B?\" We can figure this out by dividing the distance traveled by the speed we're going. For example, if you drive your car at 70 mph, it would take about 43 minutes to go from San Diego to Los Angeles (200 miles / 70 mph). To calculate how much time has passed since the beginning of our journey, we divide 3150 by 42 which equals 74.76. Rounding upwards to the nearest whole number gives us 75 hours and 45 minutes or 3 days. Therefore, we can say that 3 / 3150 of our trip was covered in 3 days. To express this as a percent, we multiply 3 by 100 which gives us 300%. Thus, 300% of our trip was covered in 3 days. Alternatively, we could also use the formula: 3 / 3150 * 100 = 300%.
