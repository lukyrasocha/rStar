{"id": 1145, "problem": "Faraday owns a flower shop. He sells a sunflower that costs $1 each and a bouquet of sunflower that costs $1. If Faraday earned $59 from the sunflower and $78 from the bouquet per day, and if each bouquet has 11 sunflowers, how many sunflowers was Faraday able to sell after 10 days?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "Faraday sold $78 / $1 = <<78/1=78>>78 bouquets of sunflower.\nSo he was able to sell a total of 11 x 78 = <<11*78=858>>858 sunflowers from the bouquets.\nAnd he was able to sell a total of $59/$1= <<59/1=59>>59 Sunflowers.\nThe sum of sunflowers Faraday was able to sell is 858 + 59 = <<858+59=917>>917.\nTherefore, the total of sunflowers he sold after 10 days is 917 x 10 = <<917*10=9170>>9170.\n#### 9170", "gold_answer": "9170"}
