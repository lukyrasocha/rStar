First, let's figure out how many people were kicked out because of shoplifting. We know that a number equals to four times that many minus 5 were kicked out for shoplifting. This means that we can substitute the number that was mentioned before as the missing value for the number here. 3 x 4 = 12 and 12 - 5 = 7. So 7 people were kicked out because of shoplifting. Next, we need to figure out how many people were kicked out because of physical violence. We know that three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. So this means that three times 7 is 21 people were kicked out for physical violence. We still have not figured out how many people were kicked out for other reasons. So the total number of people who were kicked out was 3 + 7 + 21 = 31. Since we know that the total number of people who were kicked out is 60, we can use simple subtraction to find out how many people were kicked out for other reasons. 60 - 31 = 29.

First, let's figure out how many customers were kicked out for not wearing masks. We know that three times the number of people who were kicked out for shoplifting were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. We also know that a number equals to four times that many minus 5 were kicked out for shoplifting. Let's start by solving this second equation. Let's call that number n. n = 4n - 5. 5 + n = 4n. Divide both sides by 4. 1/4 * (5+n) = n/4. This simplifies to n/4 = 5/4. Multiply both sides by 4. 4*n/4 = 4*5/4. n = 5. Now we know that there were 5 people kicked out for shoplifting. We also know that 3x those people were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. So it was 15 people kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. That leaves us with 20 people total in the store. Now we just have to subtract the original question. That means 3 people were kicked out for not wearing masks.

First we need to find how many people were kicked out for not wearing masks. The problem states 3 customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks. Let's call this number M.

Finally, three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. So three times the number of shoplifters means 3 x S. That is 3S. The last sentence states there were 60 people kicked out of the Walmart. Add up all the numbers. M + (4M - 5) + 3S = 60.\n\nNow we know that M + 4M - 5 + 3S = 60. To solve this equation, we need to subtract 4M from both sides. 5M - 5 + 3S = 60. To isolate the M term, add 5 to both sides. 5M + 3S = 65. To get rid of the S term, divide both sides by 3. 5M / 3 + S / 3 = 65 / 3. Divide both sides by 5. M / 3 + S / 5 = 13. Finally, multiply both sides by 3. M + 3S = 39.
