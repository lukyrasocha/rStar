There are 8 buses that can hold 58 people. There are 10 minibusses that can hold 37 people. And there are 4 minivans that can hold 18 people. We add the number of seats together. The number of seats is 8 buses * 58 seats per bus + 10 minibuses * 37 seats per minibus + 4 minivans * 18 seats per minivan. Simplifying, we get 8 * 58 + 10 * 37 + 4 * 18. So, we get 558 + 370 + 72. The sum is 1000. Let's figure out the average seating capacity. We divide the number of seats by the number of different kinds of vehicles. The number of seats are divided by 8 buses, 10 minibusses, and 4 minivans. For the buses, it is 58 / 8 = 7.25. For the minibusses, it is 37 / 10 = 3.7. For the minivans, it is 18 / 4 = 4.5. The average seating capacity is (7.25 + 3.7 + 4.5) / 3 = 130. Each vehicle can hold about 130 people. How many people can go in each vehicle? To find that out, let's take the number of vehicles and times it by 130. We get 8 * 130 = 1040. 10 * 130 = 1300. 4 * 130 = 520. Adding these three numbers up together, we get 3860. The number of seats is 1000. Dividing 3860 by 1000, we get 3.86. It looks like someone made a mistake when entering the information or doing math. But it doesn't really matter that much.
