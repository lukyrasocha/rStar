So, let's say Sue ate 3x, and her sister ate x (where x is the number of cookies her sister ate).

We want to know how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister, so we subtract the number of calories she ate from the number of calories her sister ate. To get the number of calories she ate, we multiply the number of cookies she ate by 154, which is the number of calories per cookie.

Let us call this number Y. 4Y is how many cookies Sue ate on Tuesday. 4Y is also the number of cookies her sister ate. If we know the number of cookies that Sue ate, we can calculate the difference between the total calories consumed by Sue and her sister. 4Y = 3X, since Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister on Tuesday. We need to figure out the value of Y and X. Y can be found by dividing 3X by 4. Y = 3/4 * X. X can be found by solving the equation 4Y = 3X for X. X = 3/4 * Y. We can substitute these values into our original equations to find out how many cookies Sue ate each day. 3X = 3(3/4Y) = 9/4 * Y and 4Y = 3 * (3/4Y) = 9/4 * X. To find the total number of cookies Sue ate, add them together. Sue ate 9/4 * Y + 9/4 * X. We can simplify this using algebra. Let us call the number of cookies that Sue ate C. C = 9/4 * Y + 9/4 * X. Substitute Y = 3/4 * X into this equation. C = 9/4 * (3/4 * X) + 9/4 * X. C = 9/16 * X + 9/4 * X. C = (9/16 + 9/4) * X. C = (3/4 + 3/16) * X. C = (12 + 3) * X / 4. C = (15/4) * X. We can divide both sides by 15/4 to isolate X. C / (15/4) = X. 4C / 15 = X. 4C / 15 * 4 / 1 = X. C / 3.75 = X. Use X to find the values of Y. Y = 4/3 * X. Y = 16/15 * C.
