Daniel wants to buy 9 notebooks, 7 pens, 1 calculator, and 1 geometry set.\n\nNow, I can calculate the total cost of all the items Daniel wants to buy without the discount.

There are four kinds of things we can buy from the shop: notebook, pen, calculator, and geometry set. The notebook costs 1 dollar per item. The pen costs 2 dollars per item. The calculator costs 14 dollars per item. The geometry set costs 13 dollars per item. So we need to calculate the sum of the prices of each kind of thing Daniel wanted to buy. Let's start with notebook. Daniel wants to buy 9 notebooks. That means we need to multiply 1 dollar (the price of one notebook) by 9 (the quantity of notebooks Daniel wants to buy). That will be 1 * 9 = 9. Next, let's do the same thing for pen. Daniel wants to buy 7 pens. That means we need to multiply 2 dollars (the price of one pen) by 7 (the quantity of pens Daniel wants to buy). That will be 2 * 7 = 14. Calculator costs 14 dollars per item. So we need to multiply 14 dollars (the price of one calculator) by 1 (the quantity of calculators Daniel wants to buy). That will be 14 * 1 = 14. Finally, geometry set costs 13 dollars per item. So we need to multiply 13 dollars (the price of one geometry set) by 1 (the quantity of geometry sets Daniel wants to buy). That will be 13 * 1 = 13.

One pen costs $2, and Daniel wants to buy 7 of them, which means he has to pay 7 * 2 = 14 dollars for the pens. Next we look at the calculator, it costs $14 and Daniel wants to buy just one. This means Daniel pays $14 for the calculator. And finally we look at the geometry set, it costs $13 and Daniel wants to buy one of those too, so he has to pay $13 for the geometry set.
