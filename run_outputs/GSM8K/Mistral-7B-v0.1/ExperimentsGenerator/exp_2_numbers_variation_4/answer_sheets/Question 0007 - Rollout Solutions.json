On Monday, Sue ate 3 times as many cookies as her sister. On Tuesday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister. Her sister ate 5 cookies on Monday and 6 the next day. If 1 cookie has 154 calories, we need to calculate how many calories Sue consumed than her sister. First, let's figure out how many cookies Sue ate on Monday and Tuesday. On Monday, Sue ate 3 times as many cookies as her sister. Her sister ate 5 cookies on Monday. So, Sue ate 3 * 5 = 15 cookies on Monday. On Tuesday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister. Her sister ate 6 cookies on Tuesday. So, Sue ate 4 * 6 = 24 cookies on Tuesday. Next, let's figure out how many calories Sue consumed. Sue ate 15 cookies on Monday. Since each cookie has 154 calories, Sue consumed 15 * 154 = 2310 calories on Monday. And Sue ate 24 cookies on Tuesday. Again, since each cookie has 154 calories, Sue consumed 24 * 154 = 3648 calories on Tuesday. In total, Sue consumed 2310 + 3648 = 5958 calories.
