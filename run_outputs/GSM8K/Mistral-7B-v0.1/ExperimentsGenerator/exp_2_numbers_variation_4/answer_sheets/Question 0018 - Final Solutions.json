Let's start with the first test. To pass the first test, she needed to answer 63% of all the questions, which is 62 * 0.63 = 39.26 correct answers. Since she only answered 50%, that means she got 62 * 0.5 - 39.26 = 31.74 wrong answers. We don't need to know the exact number of questions she got wrong, but we do need to know that it was less than or equal to 31.74.\n\nNow let's figure out the number of questions she needs on the second test. She needs to answer 63% of all the questions to pass. Since she already answered 50% of the first test, that leaves 39.26 * 0.63 / 0.5 = 45.74 questions on the second test. If she answers 50% of those questions, then that would be 45.74 * 0.5 = 22.87 questions correct. But we want to know how many she needs to answer to get 63%, so 63% of 45.74 is 45.74 * 0.63 = 28.67.

Since we don't need to know the exact number of questions she got wrong on the first test, we can just use the maximum value, which is 31.74.
