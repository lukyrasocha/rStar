{"id": 376, "problem": "There are 88 pupils in a class. Half of the class likes blue. One-fourth of the remaining likes green and the rest likes yellow. How many pupils like the color yellow?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "There are 88/2 = <<88/2=44>>44 pupils who like blue.\nSo, there are now 88 - 44 = <<88-44=44>>44 pupils who like either green or yellow.\nHence, 44/4 = <<44/4=11>>11 pupils like green.\nThus, 44 - 11 = <<44-11=33>>33 pupils like yellow.\n#### 33", "gold_answer": "33"}
