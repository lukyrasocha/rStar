First let's figure out how many cookies Sue ate on monday. According to the hint, 4x the amount of cookies Sue's sister eats is how many Sue eats.

Similarly, if we take the same approach for tuesday (which the problem says has twice as many cookies eaten), we know that Sue ate 26 cookies that day. To find how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister, we first add up the calories for both Sue and her sister for monday. Sue's calorie intake on monday would be 20*200=4000, while her sister's calorie intake would just be 5*200=1000. Therefore, we subtract 1000 from 4000 to get 3000. For tuesday, we do the same thing. The calorie intake for sue is 26*200=5200, and for her sister it is 13*200=2600. We again subtract 2600 from 5200 to get 2600 calories.

Let's call the number of cookies Sue's sister ate on Monday y1 and the number of cookies Sue's sister ate on Tuesday y2. Since Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister on Monday and twice as many cookies as her sister on Tuesday, we can write:\n\nx1 = 4y1\n\nx2 = 2y2\n\nThen, since Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister on Monday and 2 times as many cookies as her sister on Tuesday, we can write:\n\nx1 + x2 = 4y1 + 2y2\n\nPlugging into the equation for x1, we get:\n\n4y1 + 2y2 = 4y1 + 2y2\n\nWhich shows that x1 + x2 equals 4y1 + 2y2.\n\nNow, if we know the value of y1 and y2, we can solve for the values of x1 and x2. Since it was stated that Sue's sister ate 5 cookies on Monday and 13 on Tuesday, we can write:\n\ny1 = 5\n\ny2 = 13\n\nWe can plug these values into our equation for x1 and x2:\n\nx1 + x2 = 4(5) + 2(13)\n\nx1 + x2 = 20 + 26\n\nx1 + x2 = 46\n\nWe can now solve for x1 and x2:\n\nx1 = 46 - x2\n\nSince we want to find the number of cookies Sue ate on Monday (x1) and Tuesday (x2), let's rearrange the above equation to find x1:\n\nx1 = 46 - x2\n\nx1 + x2 = 46\n\nx2 = 46 - x1\n\nSubstituting 46 - x1 for x2 in the original equation for x1 and x2, we get:\n\nx1 + x2 = 4(5) + 2(13)\n\nx1 + 46 - x1 = 20 + 26\n\nx1 = 20 + 26 - 46\n\nx1 = -6\n\nThus, Sue ate 6 cookies on Monday.

Now let's look at the amount of cookies eaten by Sue and her sister. First, on Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister. This means that if her sister ate 5 cookies, then Sue ate 5 x 4 = 20 cookies. Similarly, on Tuesday, Sue ate 2 times as many cookies as her sister, which means that if her sister ate 13 cookies, then Sue ate 13 x 2 = 26 cookies. Now we know that Sue ate 20 + 26 = 46 cookies on both days. Let's calculate how many calories this would be. We know that 1 cookie has 200 calories, so Sue ate 20 cookies on Monday and 13 on Tuesday, which adds up to 20 x 200 + 13 x 200 = 4000 + 2600 = 6600 calories. Finally, to find out how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister, we just need to subtract the number of calories she ate (6600) from the number of calories her sister ate (5 x 200 + 13 x 200 = 1000 + 2600 = 3600).
