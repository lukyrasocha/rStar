But it's not so long when you compare it to the speed of sound, which is about 1,200 kilometers per hour. Light is faster than sound, as we know. It's because sound travels through air, which is very different from light traveling through space. Sound travels only so far before it gets absorbed or reflected. Light doesn't get affected like that. And if you want something to move even faster than light, you could try going back in time!

Birds fly at about 50 mph, so it takes about 299,792 / (50 * 1.6) = 64,941 seconds for a bird to travel 1 kilometer. A year consists of 365 days and 24 hours per day, or 365 * 24 = 8,760 hours. 64,941 seconds / 8,760 hours = 7.44 seconds for a bird to travel 1 km. Traveling at 7.44 km/h, a bird will need 64,941 / 7.44 = 8,730 km to travel 1 km/sec, which translates to 8,730 * 299,792 = 2,637,828,400 seconds to travel 1 light year. Birds will fly 1 light year every 2,637,828,400 / (8,730 * 24 * 365) = 11,573,162 years.
