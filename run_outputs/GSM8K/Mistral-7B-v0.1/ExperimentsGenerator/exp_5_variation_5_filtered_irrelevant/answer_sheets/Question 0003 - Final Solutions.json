Jim spends 2 hours watching TV and then decides to go to bed and reads for half as long. The Amazon River is approximately 6,400 kilometers long. He does this 3 times a week. To solve this problem, first we need to figure out how many hours Jim spends on TV and reading in a day. We know that Jim spends 2 hours watching TV and then he goes to bed and reads for half as long. This means he spends (2 hours on TV) + (half of 2 hours spent reading) = 2 + (2/2) = 2 + 1 = 3 hours on TV per day. Next, we need to find out how many hours Jim spends on TV and reading per week. Since Jim spends 3 times a week watching TV and reading, we can multiply the number of hours he spends per day by 3 to get the total number of hours per week. Therefore, Jim spends 3 x 3 = 9 hours on TV and reading per week. Finally, we need to find out how many hours Jim spends on TV and reading in a month. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we can multiply the number of hours Jim spends per week by 4 to get the total number of hours he spends in a month. This means Jim spends 9 hours on TV and reading per week x 4 weeks = 36 hours on TV and reading in a month. To get the total amount of time spent on TV and reading, we need to add up the number of hours spent on TV and reading in each month. So, if we know that Jim spends 36 hours on TV and reading in a month, and for every hour he spends on TV, he also spends half an hour reading. This means we can multiply the number of hours spent on TV by 2 to get the total amount of time spent on both TV and reading.
