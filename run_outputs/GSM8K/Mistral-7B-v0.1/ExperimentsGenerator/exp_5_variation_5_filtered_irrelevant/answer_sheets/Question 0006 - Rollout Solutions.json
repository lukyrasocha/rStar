Marching band ordered new uniforms. Each uniform comes with a hat, a jacket and pants. The hat costs 25, the jacket costs 3 times as much as the hat. And the pants costs the average of the hats and jackets. How much does each uniform cost total? Let's calculate each part first. Hat costs 25. Jacket costs 3 times as much as the hat, which is 25 * 3 = 75. Pants costs the average of the costs of the hat and jacket, which is (25 + 75) / 2 = 50.
