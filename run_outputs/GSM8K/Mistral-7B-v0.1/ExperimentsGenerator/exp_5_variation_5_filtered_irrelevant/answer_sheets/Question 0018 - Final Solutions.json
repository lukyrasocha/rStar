This means that the total number of questions you answer correctly must be equal to 0.7 times the total number of questions asked. On the first test, 60% of 70 questions was answered correctly. That is 70 * 0.6 = 42 questions. 42/70 = 60%. The second test has 40 questions. So we need to answer 40 * 0.7 = 28 questions. The answer is: 28.\n\nHint: To figure out how many questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test, we need to find out the total number of questions she has to answer correctly to pass. The problem tells us that to pass, you need to correctly answer 70% of the total questions. Let's call the total number of questions we have to answer correctly X. The total number of questions is the sum of the questions on both tests. The first test has 70 questions, and the second test has 40 questions. So the total number of questions is 70 + 40 = 110. We know that X has to equal 0.7 times 110. So X = 0.7 * 110 = 77. The answer is: 28.\n\nHint: To figure out the total number of questions we have to answer correctly to pass, let's break it down into smaller steps. First, we need to figure out what percentage of questions we have to get right on the first test. The problem states that to pass, you need to correctly answer 70% of the total questions. Since we don't know the total number of questions yet, let's call it X. So we need to find X * 0.7. Next, we need to find how many questions we actually got correct on the first test. The problem states that we got 60% of 70 questions correct. So we need to find 70 * 0.6. Finally, we need to subtract the number of questions we got correct on the first test from the number of questions we have to get correct overall. This means that the total number of questions we have to get right is X * 0.7 minus 70 * 0.6. Therefore, the answer is 77.\n\nHint: To figure out how many questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test, we need to calculate the total number of questions she has to answer correctly to pass. The problem states that to pass, you need to correctly answer 70% of the total questions. The total number of questions is the sum of the questions on both tests. So we need to add up the number of questions on each test. The first test has 70 questions, and the second test has 40 questions. Therefore, the total number of questions is 70 + 40 = 110. The next step is to multiply this number by 0.7 to find the percentage of questions we need to answer correctly. So, 0.7 * 110 = 77. The final step is to divide this number by 2 to account for the fact that the second test only has half as many questions as the first. Therefore, the answer is 38.5.\n\nHint: To figure out how many questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test, we first need to determine how many questions she needs to get right in total to pass. The problem states that to pass, you need to correctly answer 70% of the total questions. To do this, we first need to find out the total number of questions. The first test has 70 questions, and the second test has 40 questions. So the total number of questions is 70 + 40 = 110. To determine how many questions she needs to get right to pass, we need to multiply this number by 0.7, which represents 70% of the total questions. 0.7 * 110 = 77. So Audrey needs to correctly answer 77 questions to pass.\n\nTo figure out how many questions she needs to get right on the second test, we need to subtract the number of questions she already answered correctly from 77. We know that she answered 42 questions correctly on the first test, so we need to subtract this number from 77. 77 - 42 = 35.
