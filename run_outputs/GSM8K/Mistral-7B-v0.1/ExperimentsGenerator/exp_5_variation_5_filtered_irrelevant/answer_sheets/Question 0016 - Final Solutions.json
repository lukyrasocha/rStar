It says 4000 gallons were sold. Step 2: Next let's identify the price per gallon of milk. It says $3.5 per gallon. Step 3: Finally, let's calculate the refund amount. We can use (price per gallon) * (quantity of gallons purchased) to get the original purchase amount. Then we subtract out the cost of the bad milk. Let's try it. (Price per gallon) * (Quantity of gallons purchased) = Purchase amount. (Price per gallon) * (Quantity of gallons purchased) = ($3.5) * (4000). $3.5 * 4000 = $14,000.00. The original purchase amount was $14,000. Then we take away the cost of the bad milk. We know 2/5 of the amount of milk was bad. That means 2/5 of the quantity of milk is 2/5 of 4000. 2/5 of 4000 is 4000/5 = 800. $14,000 - $2800 = $11,200. The final refund amount was $11,200.

We know that 20% of the milk that was purchased was bad (out of date). So if there are 4000, then 20% is 4000 * 20%. But we can also calculate it as 80%, since we want the remaining amount. And 80% of 4000 is 80% * 4000 = 3200 gallons. So Mr. Marcellus returned 3200 gallons. If each gallon costs $3.50, then 3200 * 3.50 = $11,200. This is what the refund amount is. The answer is: 11200.", "value": 0.3}, "ost_step": {}}, "2": {"subquestion": "Now we can answer the question: How much did he get in refunds?", "subanswer": {"text": "The refund amount is 11200.", "value": 0.84375}, "ost_step": {}}}, "rollout_id": 26, "action_type": "SUBQUESTION"}]
