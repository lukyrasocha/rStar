So if we divide 18 by 3, which is 6, we get the amount of time that it takes one kangaroo to cross the highway. Since 1 hour equals 1/36 of a day, then 1/36 of a day times 6 equals 1/6 of a day. Turtles are slower than kangaroos, so they will take longer to cross the highway. They travel half as fast as kangaroos. That means that 6 * 2 = 12. 12 times 1/36 of a day is 12/36 of a day, or 1/3 of a day. 1/3 of a day is 1/3 * 24 = 8 hours. 8 hours is 1/3 of 1 day. Since turtles are slower than kangaroos, they will take more time to cross the highway. We can see this by dividing 8 by 2. This is 4. This would mean that turtles take twice as long to cross the highway as kangaroos.
