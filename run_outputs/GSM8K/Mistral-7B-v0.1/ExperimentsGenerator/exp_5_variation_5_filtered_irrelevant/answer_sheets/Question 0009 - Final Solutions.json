We know that there were 365 days in the non-leap year. Also, we know that there were 50 people who were kicked out of the Walmart. Let's subtract the number of people who were kicked out for other reasons from the number of people who were kicked out altogether. That gives us 50 - 365 = 50 - (365 - 1). We can see that this is the number of people who were kicked out for other reasons. It turns out that 50 - 365 = -315.\n\nNow, let's move on to the second question. We are asked to find the number of customers who were kicked out for shoplifting. According to the problem statement, a number equals to four times that many minus 5 were kicked out for shoplifting. This tells us that the number of customers kicked out for shoplifting must be equal to (4 * n) - 5, where n is the number of customers who were kicked out for not wearing masks.\n\nTo find the number of customers who were kicked out for not wearing masks, we need to look back at the first sentence of the problem statement. It tells us that three customers were kicked out of the Walmart for refusing to wear masks. Therefore, n must be equal to 3. Substituting this value into our equation, we get (4 * 3) - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7. Thus, the number of customers who were kicked out for shoplifting is 7.\n\nFinally, let's consider the third question. It asks us to determine the number of customers who were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. To answer this question, we need to use the information from the third sentence of the problem statement. According to this sentence, three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. Since we already know that seven customers were kicked out for shoplifting, we can calculate the number of customers who were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale as 3 * 7 = 21.\n\nTo sum up, the answer to the original question is that three customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks, seven customers were kicked out for shoplifting, and twenty-one customers were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale.", "value": 0.0625}}}, "rollout_id": 2, "action_type": "DIRECT_ANSWER"}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "3 customers were kicked out of the Walmart for refusing to wear masks.

We know this because it's given as part of the problem. We are also told that 4 times that amount minus 5 was kicked out for shoplifting. Let's say that this number is x. So we can write down 4x - 5 = 7. Because 4x - 5 is equal to 7, 4x must be equal to 12. That means that x equals to 3. So 3 people were kicked out of Walmart for shoplifting. We are also told that 3 times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. So if x equals to 3, then 3x equals to 9. And since we were told that there were 50 total people kicked out, 9 plus 7 plus 3 must equal to 50. So 19 equals to 50. That means that 19 people were kicked out of Walmart for other reasons.
