Therefore, walking all of them together would require 10 * 0.5 = 5 hours per day. 5 hours a day times 7 days a week is 5 * 7 = 35 hours a week. The answer is: 35.\n\nHint: Now identify the length of the wall. It says the Great Wall of China is over 21,000 kilometers long. 21000 km is approximately 21000 / 1000 * 1.6 = 33,600 miles.\n\nHint: Multiply the length of the Great Wall and time spent walking dogs. Since it is about 33,600 miles, and each dog requires 0.5 hours a day, each dog will travel (33600/1000)*(1/2) = 16.8 miles. Because we need to walk all the dogs, that means 16.8 * 10 = 168 miles a day.\n\nHint: Convert distance from miles to hours. The distance travelled by dogs a day is 168 miles. At 60 mph, this can be covered in 168 / 60 = 2.8 hours.\n\nHint: Compute the number of hours spent taking care of dogs per week. We know each dog needs 5 hours per day and dogs are taken out once every day. So it takes 5 * 7 = 35 hours a week to take care of dogs.\n\nHint: Add up time to walk dogs and time spent walking the Great Wall. 2.8 hours to walk dogs and 33,600 miles divided by 60 mph and multiplying by 7 days in a week results in 35 + 2.8 = 37.8 hours a week.\n\nHint: Round the answer to 38.", "value": 0.65625}}}, "rollout_id": 2}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "John takes care of 10 dogs.
