Jim spends 2 hours watching tv and then goes to sleep and reads for half as long. The amazon river is approximately 6400 kilometers long. He does this 3 times per week. Let's start by finding out how long jim spends reading each day. It says he reads for half as long as he watches tv. So if he reads for 1 hour, he must watch tv for 2 hours. Let's find out how long he watches tv each day. Since it says he spends 2 hours watching tv, we know he reads for 1 hour. Now let's figure out how long he spends each day on both tv and reading combined. Since he watches tv for 2 hours and reads for 1 hour, he spends 2 + 1 = 3 hours per day on both tv and reading together. Now let's find out how long he spends per week on both tv and reading together. Since he does this 3 times per week, he spends 3 * 3 = 9 hours per week on both tv and reading together. Now let's find out how long he spends in 4 weeks on both tv and reading together.
