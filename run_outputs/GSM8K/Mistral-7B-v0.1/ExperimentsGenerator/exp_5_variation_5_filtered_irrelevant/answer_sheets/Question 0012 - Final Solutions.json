Since we want to know how much money Daniel has to spend, we can calculate the total cost first. A notebook costs $1.5 each, so 5 notebooks would be 5 * 1.5 = $7.5. A pen costs $0.25 each, so 2 pens would be 2 * 0.25 = $0.5. A calculator costs $12 each, so 1 calculator would be 1 * 12 = $12.

Each pen costs 0.25 dollars. 2 * 0.25 is 0.5 dollars. Next, the cost of the calculator. Daniel wants 1 calculator. Each calculator costs 12 dollars. 12 dollars is the cost of the calculator.

The shop gives a 10% discount on all the purchased items.\n\nFirst, let's identify the initial cost of the items without any discount. The cost of 5 notebooks is 5 x $1.5 = $7.50. The cost of 2 pens is 2 x $0.25 = $0.50. The cost of 1 calculator is $12. The cost of 1 geometry set is $10. Adding these together, we get the total cost without any discount. It is $7.50 + $0.50 + $12 + $10 = $29.50.\n\nNext, let's multiply the cost of the items by the quantity to get the total cost of the items. The total cost is 5 x $1.5 = $7.50, 2 x $0.25 = $0.50, 1 x $12 = $12, 1 x $10 = $10.\n\nFinally, let's calculate the discount percentage. The discount percentage is 10%, which means 10% off the original price. In this case, it is 10% of $29.50. This is $2.95.\n\nSo Daniel has to spend $7.50 + $0.50 + $12 + $10 - $2.95 = $29.50 - $2.95 = $26.55.

The shop offers a 10% discount on all the items bought. We need to find out what the total cost of all the items bought would be before the 10% discount. To calculate this, we first calculate the price of each item by multiplying its price with the quantity. For example, the price of 5 notebooks would be 1.5 * 5 = 7.5$. The price of 2 pens would be 0.25 * 2 = 0.5$. Similarly, the price of the calculator would be 12 * 1 = 12$ and that of the geometry set would be 10 * 1 = 10$. Now we add up the prices of all the items to get the total price before discount. 7.5$ + 0.5$ + 12$ + 10$ = 29.5$. This is the total price before discount.

A pen costs 0.25 cents. A calculator costs $12. A geometry set costs $10. Now, we can determine how much Daniel has to pay. Daniel needs 5 notebooks, so that would be 5 * 1.5 = 7.5. That means he needs to pay 7.5. Next, Daniel needs two pens. That would be 2 * 0.25 = 0.5. Daniel also needs to pay 0.5. He needs one calculator, which costs 12. And finally, Daniel needs one geometry set. That costs 10. Daniel needs to pay 10. Then, Daniel gets 10% off, which is 10%. This makes all of Daniel's purchases 90% of their original price. Therefore, Daniel needs to pay 90% of 7.5 + 90% of 0.5 + 90% of 12 + 90% of 10. All together, Daniel needs to pay 90% of 29.50. We can simplify this to (29.5 / 100) * 0.9.
