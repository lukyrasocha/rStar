The sun is 149.6 million kilometers away from the earth. That is a lot! Let's break it up into smaller numbers. One million is equal to 1000000. 1000000 is equal to 1000 times 1000. So there are 1000 in 1 million and 1000000 / 1000 = 1000 times 1000. Similarly, there are 1000 in 1 billion and 1000000000 / 1000 = 1000 times 1000000. There are 1000 in 1 trillion and 1000000000000 / 1000 = 1000 times 1000000000. Finally, 149.6 is between 100 and 200. 149.6 can be written as 100 + 49.6 = 100 + (100 + 4). Since 4 is less than 100, we can use a hundred block to represent 100 and a ten block to represent 10. Thus, we can write 149.6 using blocks as 100+100+10+4. There are 11 tens and 4 ones. We can write 11 tens as 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 and 4 ones as 4 + 0. Thus, 149.6 million kilometers can be expressed as 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 0.

Since it is so far away, it takes light about 8 minutes to reach us from the sun. Also, we can approximate it as light travelling at 300,000 km/s because this will not affect our calculation too much. Since it takes 8 minutes for light to reach us, that means that it would take 8 / (300,000 km / s) seconds for light to travel at 300,000 km/s to get to us.
