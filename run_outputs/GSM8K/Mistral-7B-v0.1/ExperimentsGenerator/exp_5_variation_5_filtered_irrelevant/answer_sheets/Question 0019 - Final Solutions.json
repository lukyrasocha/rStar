First, the time it takes for the coat of varnish on one painting to dry with the old varnish. It is 7 minutes. Second, the time it takes for the coat of varnish on one painting to dry with the new varnish. It is 12 minutes. Let's say the height of the building is h. The height of the building divided by the time it takes for the coat of varnish to dry on one painting using the old varnish will be the speed of the drying of the coat of varnish with the old varnish. Or, the height of the building divided by the time it takes for the coat of varnish to dry on one painting using the new varnish will be the speed of the drying of the coat of varnish with the new varnish. So, (height of the building / old varnish) - (height of the building / new varnish). We know that 7 minutes is used up for the height of the building using the old varnish. 12 minutes is used up for the same height of the building using the new varnish. The difference between them is 12 - 7 which is equal to 5. That means, for every minute, the new varnish takes 5 more minutes than the old varnish to dry. Let's calculate what is 5 times 6 paintings.
