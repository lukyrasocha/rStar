Each sunflower cost $2. Assuming he sold x sunflowers, then 2 * x was the amount of money he earned. Similarly, he sold x/12 bouquets, because each bouquet contain 12 sunflower.

Next, let's figure out when the human eye blinks 4,200,000 times a year. Multiplying 4,200,000 by the number of times you blink in a second, you can find out how many times your eyes blink every year. 4,200,000 * b = times eyes blinking every year. Solving for b, dividing 4,200,000 by the number of times you blink in a second. b = 4,200,000 / number of times you blink in a second.

We get x=13. Now let's find out how many sunflowers he sold per day. To do this, we need to calculate how many bouquet he sells. Since a bouquet contains 12 sunflowers, we can say x/12 is the number of bouquets he sells. Next, we calculate the amount of money he gets from selling bouquet by multiplying the amount of money he earns from the bouquet with the number of bouquet he sells. Therefore, $8 * (x / 12) = $56. Substituting x into the above equation, we get: $8 * (13 / 12) = $56. Simplify the fraction to get 13/12. So $8 * 13/12 = $56. $8 * 13/12 = 8 * 13 / 12. From here, you can cancel common factors like 8 or 12. So $8 * 13/12 = 13. That means, he sells one bouquet everyday. So he sold x = 13 sunflower every day.
