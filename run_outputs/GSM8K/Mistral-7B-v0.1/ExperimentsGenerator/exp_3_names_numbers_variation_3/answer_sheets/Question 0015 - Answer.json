{"id": 1145, "problem": "Mark owns a flower shop. He sells a sunflower that costs $1 each and a bouquet of sunflower that costs $32. If Mark earned $42 from the sunflower and $85 from the bouquet per day, and if each bouquet has 16 sunflowers, how many sunflowers was Mark able to sell after 6 days?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "Mark sold $85 / $32 = <<85/32=2.65625>>2.65625 bouquets of sunflower.\nSo he was able to sell a total of 16 x 2.65625 = <<16*2.65625=42.5>>42.5 sunflowers from the bouquets.\nAnd he was able to sell a total of $42/$1= <<42/1=42>>42 Sunflowers.\nThe sum of sunflowers Mark was able to sell is 42.5 + 42 = <<42.5+42=84.5>>84.5.\nTherefore, the total of sunflowers he sold after 6 days is 84.5 x 6 = <<84.5*6=507>>507.\n#### 507", "gold_answer": "507"}
