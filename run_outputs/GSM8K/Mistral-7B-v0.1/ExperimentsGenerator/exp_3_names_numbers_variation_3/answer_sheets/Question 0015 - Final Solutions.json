Let's first calculate the cost of sunflowers sold. Since Mark sells a sunflower for $1 and a bouquet of sunflowers for $32, and each bouquet has 16 sunflowers, we need to multiply the number of bouquets sold by the cost of a bouquet, then add it to the number of sunflowers sold multiplied by their cost. Let's call the number of bouquets sold \"B\" and the number of sunflowers sold \"S\". Then, the cost of sunflowers sold for each day is: (32 * B) + (1 * S). Similarly, the cost of bouquets sold each day is: (32 * B). Therefore, the total cost of sunflowers sold for each day is: (32 * B) + (1 * S) + (32 * B) = 32(B + 1) + S. To calculate the total cost of sunflowers sold after 6 days, simply multiply this equation by 6: 32(B + 1) + S) * 6 = 192(B + 1) + 6S. Now let's plug in the values given in the problem statement. Mark earns $42 from selling sunflowers and $85 from selling bouquets per day, so 32(B + 1) + S is equal to 42, and 192(B + 1) + 6S is equal to 85.
