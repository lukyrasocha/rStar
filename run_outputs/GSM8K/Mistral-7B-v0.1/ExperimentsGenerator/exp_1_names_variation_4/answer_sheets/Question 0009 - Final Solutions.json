To do that, we first need to know the number of people who were kicked out for each reason.\n\nThe problem tells us that 3 customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks. That means the number of people who were kicked out for not wearing masks is 3.\n\nNext, the problem says that a number equals to four times that many minus 5 were kicked out for shoplifting. This means that the number of people who were kicked out for shoplifting is four times the number of people who weren't wearing masks, minus 5. We can substitute the value of the number of people who weren't wearing masks (which is 3) into the equation to get the number of people who were kicked out for shoplifting. So, the number of people who were kicked out for shoplifting is 4*3-5=11.\n\nFinally, the problem says that three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. Since we already know the number of people who were kicked out for shoplifting, we can use that number to find the number of people who were kicked out for physical violence. So, the number of people who were kicked out for physical violence is 3*11=33.\n\nNow that we know the numbers of people who were kicked out for each reason, we can find the number of people who were kicked out for other reasons. Since the total number of people who were kicked out is 50, and we already know the numbers of people who were kicked out for each reason, we can subtract those numbers from 50 to find the number of people who were kicked out for other reasons.\n\nSo, the number of people who were kicked out for other reasons is 50-(3+11+33)=50-47=3.\n\nIn conclusion, there were 3 people who were kicked out of the Walmart for reasons other than refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, or physical violence over goods on sale.\n\nThe answer is: 3.", "value": 0.09375}}}, "rollout_id": 17}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "3 customers were kicked out of the Walmart for refusing to wear masks.

If a total of 50 people were kicked out of the Walmart, how many were kicked out for other reasons?\n\nIn order to answer this question, we need to find the number of people who were kicked out for wearing masks, and the number of people who were kicked out for shoplifting, and the number of people who were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale.\n\nAccording to the problem, 3 customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks.
