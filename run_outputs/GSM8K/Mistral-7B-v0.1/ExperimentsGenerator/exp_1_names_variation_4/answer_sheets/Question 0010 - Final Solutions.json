To find the total number of pupils who like blue and green combined, we can use multiplication. Half of the class equals to half of the class, or 20 pupils. One-fourth of the remaining equals to one-fourth of 20 pupils, which is 5 pupils. The total number of pupils who like blue and green combined is 20 pupils + 5 pupils = 25 pupils. We know that half of the class likes blue and one-fourth of the remaining likes green. This means that the remaining pupils are not part of either group. Thus, the remaining pupils are the ones who like the color yellow. Since we know that the total number of pupils who like blue and green combined is 25 pupils, we can subtract this from the total number of pupils in the class, which is 40 pupils. 40 pupils minus 25 pupils equals 15 pupils.
