{"id": 550, "problem": "A shop sells school supplies. One notebook is sold at $1.5 each, a pen at $0.25 each, a calculator at $12 each, and a geometry set at $10 each. Mark is a engineering student, and Mark wants to buy 5 notebooks, 2 pens, 1 calculator, and 1 geometry set. The shop gives a 10% discount on all the purchased items. How much does Mark have to spend on all the items Mark wants to buy?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "5 notebooks cost 5 x $1.5 = $<<5*1.5=7.5>>7.5.\n2 pens cost 2 x $0.25 = $<<2*0.25=0.5>>0.5.\nThe total cost is $7.5 + $0.5 = $<<7.5+0.5=8>>30.\nThe total discount is 10% of $30 = $<<10*30/100=3>>3.\nTherefore, Mark has to spend $30 - $3 = $<<30-3=27>>27 on all the items Mark wants to buy.\n#### 27", "gold_answer": "27"}
