Since a single sunflower costs $2, Daniel can sell 13 (daily sunflower sales) sunflowers for $26, which is $26/13 = $2/flower. For a bouquet, since it costs $0.67/flower, Daniel can sell 84 (daily bouquet sales) bouquets for $56, which is $56/84 = $0.67/flower.

He sells a sunflower that costs $2 each and a bouquet of sunflower that costs $8. If Daniel earned $26 from the sunflower and $56 from the bouquet per day, and if each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, how many sunflowers was Daniel able to sell after 3 days? Let's convert the price of a single sunflower and the price of a bouquet into dollars per flower. For a single sunflower, it costs $2 divided by 1 sunflower is $2/1, or $2 per flower. For a bouquet, it costs $8 divided by 12 sunflowers is $8/12, or $0.67 per flower. Calculate the daily earnings for each type of sunflower and add them up. Since a single sunflower costs $2, Daniel can sell 13 (daily sunflower sales) sunflowers for $26, which is $26/13 = $2/flower. For a bouquet, since it costs $0.67/flower, Daniel can sell 84 (daily bouquet sales) bouquets for $56, which is $56/84 = $0.67/flower.
