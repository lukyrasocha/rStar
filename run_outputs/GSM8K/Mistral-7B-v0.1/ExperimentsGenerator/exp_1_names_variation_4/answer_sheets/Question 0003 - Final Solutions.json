First, calculate the total amount of time Matthew spends watching TV each week. He watches TV for 2 hours 3 days per week. So, in one week he spends 2 x 3 = 6 hours watching TV. Next, calculate the total amount of time Matthew spends reading each week. He reads for half as long as he watches TV. So, in one week he spends 2 / 2 = 1 hour reading. Then multiply the total amount of time spent watching TV and reading by 4 to get the total number of hours in 4 weeks. So, in 4 weeks, Matthew spends 6 (total amount of time spent watching TV) x 4 (number of weeks) = 24 hours watching TV and 1 (total amount of time spent reading) x 4 (number of weeks) = 4 hours reading.
