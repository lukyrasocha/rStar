Again, let's call the number of players on the special teams N2. Then we know N2 / 2 = N players. This means N2 = 2N players. Therefore, we need to find out the value of N2. N2 = 2N = 2 * (2N / 2) = 2 * N2 / 2 = N2. Solving for N2, we see that N2 = 0, which is not possible, since we can't have zero players. Therefore, there cannot be any players on the special teams. So there are no players on the special teams, and the remaining players are all either on the offense or on the defense. Since there are no players on the special teams, we know the total number of players is 140 - 0 = 140. Dividing this by two, we get 70 players on the offense.

Let's say it has half the number of people. 3) The special teams. It is half as big as the defense. Let's say it has half the number of people.\n\nWe know that the number of people on the offense is 2x times bigger than the number of people on the defense. And we also know that the number of people on the defense is half the number of people on the special teams. So we can say that the number of people on the offense is twice the number of people on the special teams. And the number of people on the special teams is twice the number of people on the defense. This makes sense because when you double something, you get a number that is four times as large. When you divide something by half, you get a number that is a quarter as big. Therefore, if you divide a number by half twice, you will get a number that is one fourth as big.\n\nSo now we can find out how many people are on the defense. We know that the number of people on the offense is twice the number of people on the special teams, and the number of people on the special teams is twice the number of people on the defense. So the number of people on the defense is one fourth of the number of people on the offense.
