Daniel is a engineering student, and Daniel wants to buy 4 notebooks, 5 pens, 1 calculator, and 1 geometry set. The shop gives a 5% discount on all the purchased items. How much does Daniel have to spend on all the items Daniel wants to buy?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "4 notebooks cost 4 x $1 = $<<4*1=4>>4.\n5 pens cost 5 x $2 = $<<5*2=10>>10.\nThe total cost is $4 + $10 = $<<4+10=14>>40.\nThe total discount is 5% of $40 = $<<5*40/100=2>>2.\nTherefore, Daniel has to spend $40 - $2 = $<<40-2=38>>38 on all the items Daniel wants to buy.\n#### 38", "gold_answer": "38"}
