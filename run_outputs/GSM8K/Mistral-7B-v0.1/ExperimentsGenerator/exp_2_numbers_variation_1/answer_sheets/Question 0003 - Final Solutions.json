Let's start by thinking about how many hours Jim spent on TV and reading in one day. We know he spent 8 hours watching TV. That leaves 8 / 2 = 4 hours that he could read. But he doesn't read on Saturday or Sunday, so he only reads for half as long during the other 5 days of the week. We can write this out like this:\n\n| Day | TV Hours | Reading Hours | Total Hours |\n| --- | --------- | -------------- | ----------- |\n| Mon  | 8         | 4              | 12          |\n| Tue  | 8         | 4              | 12          |\n| Wed  | 8         | 4              | 12          |\n| Thu  | 8         | 4              | 12          |\n| Fri  | 8         | 4              | 12          |\n| Sat  | --        | --             | --          |\n| Sun  | --        | --             | --          |\n\nThis is a table that shows how many hours Jim spends on TV and reading in each day of the week.
