The cost per notebook is $1. The cost per pen is $2. The cost per calculator is $19. The cost per geometry set is $7. Daniel wants to buy 4 notebooks, 5 pens, 1 calculator, and 1 geometry set. Since there is a 5% discount, we need to calculate the total cost before applying the discount. First, find the cost for each item. Notebook cost is 4 * 1 = 4. Pen cost is 5 * 2 = 10. Calculator cost is 1 * 19 = 19. Geometry set cost is 1 * 7 = 7. Adding these together, we get 4 + 10 + 19 + 7 = 40. This is the total cost for the items before applying the discount. Now apply the 5% discount. To do this, first convert the decimal into a percentage. 5% = 5/100 = 0.05. So we need to multiply our total cost by 0.05 to get the discount. 40 * 0.05 = 2.

To calculate the cost of everything, first let's find the cost of a single item. There are four types of items: notebook, pen, calculator, and geometry set. Each notebook is priced at one dollar. Four notebooks costs 1 * 4 = 4 dollars. Similarly, a pen costs two dollars, so five pens costs 2 * 5 = 10 dollars. A calculator costs nineteen dollars, so one calculator costs 19 dollars. Lastly, a geometry set costs seven dollars. Therefore, one geometry set costs 7 dollars. With this information, we can find out the cost of all the items Dan wants to buy. Let's start with notebooks. As there were four notebooks, the cost of all four of them was 4 dollars. Next, we move onto pens. We know that the cost of all the pens was 10 dollars. Following that, the calculator was 19 dollars. Last but not least, the cost of all the geometry sets was 7 dollars. Now, we put these together. The cost of Dan's items is 4 + 10 + 19 + 7 = 40 dollars. However, we need to remember that there is a 5% discount on all of the items. Since we have the amount, we just need to find the percentage. This means we will divide 40 by 100. If we multiply it by 5%, that will be (40 / 100) * 5%. That means we multiply 40 by 0.05. 40 * 0.05 = 2. So we will get a discount of 2 dollars.

Adding those two numbers together (4 + 10), we get 14. Moving on to the calculators, there is only one, so 1 x 19 is 19. Finally, we come to the geometry sets. There is one of them as well, so that's 1 x 7 = 7. All four items combined will be 14 + 19 + 7 = 40. But Daniel gets a 5% discount! 40 * 95% = 38.

The shop gives a 5% discount on all the purchased items. 5% off of all the items would make it less expensive. So we can calculate the price of all the items Daniel wanted to buy, subtract 5%, and find out how much Daniel has to pay in total. We need to convert the percent into a decimal so we can multiply. 5% = 5/100 = 0.05. 5% off of something means we need to subtract 0.05. The price of all the items Daniel wanted to buy before the discount was: 4 x 1 + 5 x 2 + 1 x 19 + 1 x 7 = 4 + 10 + 19 + 7 = 40. After the discount, the price would be: 40 - 0.05 * 40 = 40 - 2 = 38.
