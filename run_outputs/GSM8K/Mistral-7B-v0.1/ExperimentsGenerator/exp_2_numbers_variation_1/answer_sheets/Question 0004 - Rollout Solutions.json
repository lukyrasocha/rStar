I can see that this number is very big. But I don't know if it is a good idea to start subtracting 2466 from 9866. Let's first consider what fraction of the total number of pieces Poppy has placed on the board. I know that Poppy placed 1/4th of all the pieces on the board.

Poppy started with 9866 pieces. She placed a quarter of those on the board. That means she left 9866 - 2466 = 7400. Her mother placed one third of those on the board. One third of 7400 is 7400 / 3 = 2467. So there are 2467 - 7400 = 4933 pieces left to be placed. The answer is: 4933.\n\nHint 2: We can also add up all the remaining pieces (from Poppy and from Mom) by working backwards:\n\n* 4933 pieces left to be placed\n* + (one third of the remaining pieces placed by Mom)\n* + (quarter of the initial amount of pieces placed by Poppy)\n* = all the remaining pieces\n\nWe already know what is left to be placed: 4933 pieces. What we need is to calculate the other parts. We know that one third of the remaining pieces was placed by Mom. Let's call that number R. It means that one third of R was placed, which is R / 3. And we also know that quarter of the initial amount of pieces was placed by Poppy, which is 9866 / 4.\n\nSo we can write:\n\n4933 = R + R/3 + 9866/4\n\nTo solve this equation, let's multiply both sides by 12:\n\n4933*12 = R*12 + (R/3)*12 + (9866/4)*12\n\nSimplify it:\n\n59,196 = 12R + 4R + 24664\n\nSubtract 24664 from both sides:\n\n59,196 - 24664 = 12R + 4R - 24664\n\nSimplify it again:\n\n34,532 = 16R\n\nDivide both sides by 16:\n\n34,532/16 = R\n\nThat gives us 2158 as the value of R.
