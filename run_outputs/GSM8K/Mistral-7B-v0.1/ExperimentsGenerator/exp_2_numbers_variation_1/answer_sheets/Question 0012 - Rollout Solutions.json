One notebook is sold at $1 each. A pen at $2 each, a calculator at $19 each, and a geometry set at $7 each. The prices are in the format of [notebook=1, pen=2, calculator=19, geometry set=7]. Now that we know the price of each item, it's time to calculate how much Daniel needs to pay to get everything he wants. Let's start with the most basic calculation, which is getting all the notebooks he wanted. 4 notebooks at $1 each is 4 x 1 = 4. Next up are the pens. 5 pens at $2 each is 5 x 2 = 10. Adding those two numbers together (4 + 10), we get 14. Moving on to the calculators, there is only one, so 1 x 19 is 19. Finally, we come to the geometry sets. There is one of them as well, so that's 1 x 7 = 7. All four items combined will be 14 + 19 + 7 = 40. But Daniel gets a 5% discount! 40 * 95% = 38.
