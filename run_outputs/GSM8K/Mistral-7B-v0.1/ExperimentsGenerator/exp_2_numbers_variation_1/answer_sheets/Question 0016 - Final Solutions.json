First, let's calculate the total amount of money spent on the milk. The company sold 4564 gallons of milk to Mr. Marcellus's store at the cost of $2 per gallon. So, the total amount of money spent would be $2 * 4564 = $9128. Next, let's figure out how much milk went bad. Since 1/8 of the milk was bad, we can divide the total amount of milk (4564) by 8 to find the amount of milk that was still good. That would be 4564 / 8 = 570.5 gallons of milk remained good. Now, we need to calculate the amount of money spent on the bad milk. Since we already know the amount of good milk, we can subtract it from the total amount of milk to find the amount of bad milk. The amount of bad milk would be 4564 - 570.5 = 3993.5 gallons of milk. Since the company sold milk at a rate of $2 per gallon, the amount of money spent on the bad milk would be $2 * 3993.5 = $7987. Finally, we can calculate the refund amount by subtracting the amount of money spent on the bad milk ($7987) from the total amount of money spent on the milk ($9128).
