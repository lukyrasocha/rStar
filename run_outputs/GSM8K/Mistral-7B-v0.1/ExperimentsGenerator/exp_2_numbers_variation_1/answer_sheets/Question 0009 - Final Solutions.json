We get 3n= 79 - (4x(n)-5). Add 5 to both sides. We get 3n+5=79-4x(n). Divide both sides by 3. We get n+(5/3)=(79-4x(n))/(3). Multiply both sides by 3. We get 3n+(5*3)=79-4x(n). Solve for x(n). We get 3n+(5*3)=79-4x(n). 3n+(5*3)=79-4x(n). Substitute 3n = 79-(4x(n)-5). We get 79-(4x(n)-5)+5*3=79-4x(n). 79-(4x(n)-5)+5*3=79-4x(n). Simplify.

The answer is 3.", "value": 0.7}, "ost_step": {}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's think step by step. First of all, we know that three customers were kicked out of the Walmart for refusing to wear masks. Also, 79 people were kicked out totally. We don't know about how many people were kicked out for shoplifting or physical violence over goods on sale, so let's solve for that first. Four times that many minus 5 was equal to the number of shoplifters. We know that the number of people for shoplifting is 4m - 5. 4m - 5 is 4m minus 5. Subtracting 5 from it makes sense because it gives us 4m - 5 which matches what was written in the prompt. This means that 4m minus 5 was equal to the number of shoplifters. Next, we can work backwards and find the value of m. Three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. The number of people for physical violence over goods on sale is 3(4m - 5). Because this matches what was written in the prompt, that makes sense. That is the number of people for physical violence over goods on sale. Next, we need to subtract those numbers from the 79. Subtracting 3 people who refused to wear masks from the 79 leaves 76 people. Subtracting 3(4m - 5) leaves 76 - 12m + 15. Simplify that expression further. It becomes 76 - 12m + 15 is equal to 16. Solve the equation for m. 76 - 12m + 15 is 16. Add both sides by 15. You get 76 - 12m is 31. Divide both sides by 12. 76/12 is equal to m. M is 6. Finally, we can calculate how many people were kicked out for other reasons. 76 - 12m + 15 is 16. Substitute 6 for m. 76 - 12*6 + 15 is 16. 76 - 72 + 15 is 16. 4 + 15 is 16. 19 is 16.
