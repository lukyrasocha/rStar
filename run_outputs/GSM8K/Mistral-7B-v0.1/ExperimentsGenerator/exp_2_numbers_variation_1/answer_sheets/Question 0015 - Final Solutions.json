Let's think step by step. Each sunflower costed 3 dollars. The bouquet costed 5 dollars. Faraday sold 16 sunflowers for 16 dollars. 16 divided by 3 is 5. That means he sold 5 bouquets for 5 * 5 = 25 dollars. That is half of the money from the bouquet. So the other half was 93 - 25 = 68 dollars. So 5 sunflowers each costs 68 dollars. So 68 / 5 is 13.6 dollars. 13.6 divided by 3 is 4.5. Since one sunflower costs 3 dollars, four and a half sunflower would equal 13.5 dollars. That leaves us with 13.5 - 13 = 0.5.
