I can see that this number is very big. But I don't know if it is a good idea to start subtracting 2466 from 9866. Let's first consider what fraction of the total number of pieces Poppy has placed on the board. I know that Poppy placed 1/4th of all the pieces on the board.

This means that 3/4 of the remaining pieces were placed by Poppy's mom. Since 3/4 times the total number of pieces (9866) minus those already placed (a quarter, or 1/4, of the total) equals the remaining pieces, we can say 3/4 of (9866 - 9866 / 4) are what is left to be placed. Multiply 3/4 times this expression to find the remaining pieces. 3/4 of (9866 - 9866 / 4) = 3/4 of (9866 - 2466). Since multiplication precedes subtraction, this becomes 3/4(9866-2466). Finally, simplifying we get (3/4)(9866-2466)=(9866-2466)3/4. Substituting 9866 for PiecesA, this expression becomes PiecesA(3/4)-PiecesA(3/4)/(4/4), which in turn reduces to (PiecesA(3/4)-PiecesA(3/4))(4/4). From here, using the distributive property, (PiecesA(3/4)-PiecesA(3/4))(4/4) is equal to (PiecesA(3/4)*4/4)-(PiecesA(3/4)*4/4). Using the associative property, this last expression equals (PiecesA(3/4)*4/4)-(PiecesA(3/4)*4/4). Since division is also associative, the resulting expression simplifies further to (PiecesA(3/4)*4)-(PiecesA(3/4)*4). With the commutative law, this finally becomes (PiecesA(4*3/4))-(PiecesA(4*3/4)), so you can see that the result of our simplification is zero.

One third of 7400 is 7400 / 3 = 2467. So there are 2467 - 7400 = 4933 pieces left to be placed. The answer is: 4933.\n\nHint 2: We can also add up all the remaining pieces (from Poppy and from Mom) by working backwards:\n\n* 4933 pieces left to be placed\n* + (one third of the remaining pieces placed by Mom)\n* + (quarter of the initial amount of pieces placed by Poppy)\n* = all the remaining pieces\n\nWe already know what is left to be placed: 4933 pieces. What we need is to calculate the other parts. We know that one third of the remaining pieces was placed by Mom. Let's call that number R. It means that one third of R was placed, which is R / 3. And we also know that quarter of the initial amount of pieces was placed by Poppy, which is 9866 / 4.\n\nSo we can write:\n\n4933 = R + R/3 + 9866/4\n\nTo solve this equation, let's multiply both sides by 12:\n\n4933*12 = R*12 + (R/3)*12 + (9866/4)*12\n\nSimplify it:\n\n59,196 = 12R + 4R + 24664\n\nSubtract 24664 from both sides:\n\n59,196 - 24664 = 12R + 4R - 24664\n\nSimplify it again:\n\n34,532 = 16R\n\nDivide both sides by 16:\n\n34,532/16 = R\n\nThat gives us 2158 as the value of R.

Poppy put a quarter of the pieces (2466) on the board. Then her mom put a third of the remaining pieces. So, let's see what was the remaining amount of pieces after Poppy's placement. We need to take away the quarters which Poppy put on the board. So the remaining amount of pieces after Poppy's placement will be 9866 - 2466 = 7399. Now, we have one more step which is finding the third of the pieces. We divide 7399 by 3. This gives us 2466. So, 3 quarters of the original pieces were placed on the board. The last piece left to be placed will be 9866 - 2466 - 2466 = 4934.

Poppy placed a quarter of all the pieces. Let's call this first set S. Her mom placed a third of the remaining pieces, so let's call the second set S_1. When we add them up together, we get all the original pieces. S + S_1 = 9866. This means S + S_1 / 3 = 9866 / 3 = 3288. Let's find out how much S_1 is. S_1 = 3288 - S. S_1 = 3288 - 2466 = 822. So there are 822 pieces left. The answer is: 822.\n\nHint 2: What happens when you multiply 1/4 and 1/3? It gets 1/12. So if 1/4 pieces go on the board first, then 1/3 pieces afterwards, it means 1/12 of all the pieces are not yet on the board! The answer is 1/12 * 9866 = 822.", "value": 0.15625}}}, "rollout_id": 0}]
