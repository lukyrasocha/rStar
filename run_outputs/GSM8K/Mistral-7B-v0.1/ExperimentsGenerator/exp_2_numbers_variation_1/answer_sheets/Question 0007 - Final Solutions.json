Let's start by identifying the number of calories per cookie. It says one cookie has 111 calories. So that means each cookie has 111 calories. Next, we multiply the number of cookies eaten by each person on each day by the calories per cookie. This gives us the number of calories consumed by each person on each day. To find the number of calories consumed by Sue, we multiply the number of cookies she ate on each day by 111 calories. Similarly, for her sister, we multiply the number of cookies she ate on each day by 111 calories. Now that we have the number of calories consumed by each person on each day, we can subtract the number of calories consumed by the sister on each day from the number of calories consumed by Sue on each day. This gives us the number of calories that Sue consumed more than her sister. So we need to subtract the number of calories consumed by the sister on each day from the number of calories consumed by Sue on each day. For example, if Sue ate 2 times as many cookies as her sister on Monday and 2 times as many cookies as her sister on Tuesday, and her sister ate 8 cookies on Monday and 11 cookies on Tuesday, then we would calculate the following: 2 * (number of cookies ate on monday) * calories per cookie + 2 * (number of cookies ate on tuesday) * calories per cookie - (number of cookies ate on monday) * calories per cookie - (number of cookies ate on tuesday) * calories per cookie = 2 * 8 * 111 + 2 * 11 * 111 - 8 * 111 - 11 * 111 = 2400 + 2402 - 888 - 1221 = 4489 - 2109 = 2380. Finally, we will subtract the total number of calories that Sue consumed on each day from the total number of calories that her sister consumed on each day. This will give us the number of calories that Sue consumed more than her sister.

They ate cookies. We know Sue eats 2 times as many cookies as her sister. So we need to keep track of them both separately. Let's call the number of cookies Sue eats S, and the number of cookies her sister eats HS. That way S is 2 x HS. On Monday, Sue ate 2 times as many cookies as her sister. Her sister ate 8 cookies on Monday. So Sue ate 2 x 8 = 16 cookies on Monday. We also know that on Tuesday, Sue ate 2 times as many cookies as her sister. Her sister ate 11 cookies on Tuesday. So Sue ate 2 x 11 = 22 cookies on Tuesday. We can work it backwards to find out how many cookies the sister ate on Monday and Tuesday. We know that the sister ate 8 on Monday, so Sue ate 16.
