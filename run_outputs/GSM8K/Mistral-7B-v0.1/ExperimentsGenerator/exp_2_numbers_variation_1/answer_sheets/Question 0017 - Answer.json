{"id": 1235, "problem": "Michael is traveling on the interstate at an average speed of 75 km/hr (taking into account all the necessary stops for gas, relaxation, etc.). If Michael goes on like this for 2 days, and the distance between Alaska and Texas is 5000 km, what percentage of this distance has Michael covered?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "There are 24 hours in each day, so Michael has been traveling for a total of 2 * 24 = <<2*24=48>>48 hours.\nAt a rate of 75 km/hr, Michael has covered 75 * 48 = <<75*48=3600>>3600 km.\n3600 km as a percentage of 5000 km is (3600/5000)*100% = <<(3600/5000)*100=72>>72%\n#### 72", "gold_answer": "72"}
