When dealing with times expressed per item unit like here -- unlike measurements related directly towards length distances etc.--adding up various intervals simply means adding respective digits together; thus combining results yields precise totals relative specifically within contextual parameters established initially without ambiguity due either misunderstanding intentions behind original phrasing itself\u2026 Alternatively consider comparing single events whose duration remains unaffected despite sequence differences present across similar situations involving such actions being conducted simultaneously since both cases involve equal amount(in terms)of effort involved even though sequential timing vary slightly based upon conditions applied during application process.. Thus although overall summed value might look quite large compared solely individual ones calculated independently , taking separate components into consideration makes little sense when looking holistically considering whole picture presented earlier ; therefore concluding correct approach requires aggregation first followed through subsequent processes once derived figures align accordingly w/ initial estimates previously made.(Thus keeping track throughout calculation ensures accuracy whilst simplifying comprehension alongside interpretation.)
