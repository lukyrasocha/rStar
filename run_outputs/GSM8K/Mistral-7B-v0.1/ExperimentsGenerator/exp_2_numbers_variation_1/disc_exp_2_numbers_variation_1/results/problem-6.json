An average or mean value (of course) just involves adding several values together (inclusive), dividing them up equally among all their addends (however you wish). When speaking about numbers like \u2018prices,\u2019 averaging usually implies finding which one(s?) amount would make every single item equal when divided into groups. Thus\u2026practically halfway! Half equals .5x\u2014\u2013so our next line says Pants_Cost=Hat/2+Jacket/(2*3)= Hat+ Jacket /6 [because if something becomes larger than twice itself...it won;t even matter anymore]. Therefore..Pants Cost=$((108)+(324))/-6=-$48 Because negative prices don\u2019t exist \u2013 no sane company could ever charge less than nothing ! Finally combining those quantities yields Uniform Total Price=(Hat+(108)*3)/(-(2*(2*3)-1)). Using simple substitution produces Uniform Total Value=>[(108) + ((108)*(3))] -(6)---> [(108)] -->[-($480)]; Our last expression indicates someone sold off everything but changed nothing!. This makes sense because while subtracting isn \u2019eminent good news , addition adds back onto prior results.(A positive quantity increases.)

Additionally, also note whether these schedules consider rest days important for maximizing productivity during high activity phases towards Wednesdays aiming not exceed four sessions per working week excluding Thursday. Ensure clarity about splitting longer continuous blocks into shorter spans over multiple non-consecutive days possibly due to higher intensity routines interspersed amongst relaxation windows when applicable.
