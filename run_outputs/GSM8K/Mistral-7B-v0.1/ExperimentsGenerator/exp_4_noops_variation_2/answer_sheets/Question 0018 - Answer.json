{"id": 1244, "problem": "Audrey has to take two math tests to pass 6th grade. She must correctly answer 70% of the total questions to move on to the 7th grade. The first test has 70 questions and she gets 60% of them correct. The second test has 40 questions. Audrey's favorite subject is science, but she wants to improve in math. How many questions does she need to get right on the second test to move onto the 7th grade?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "There are 110 questions in total because 70 + 40 = <<70+40=110>>110\nShe needs to get 77 of these right because 110 x .7 = <<110*.7=77>>77\nShe got 42 questions right on the first test because 70 x .6 = <<70*.6=42>>42\nShe needs to get 35 questions right on the second test because 77 - 42 = <<77-42=35>>35\n#### 35", "gold_answer": "35"}
