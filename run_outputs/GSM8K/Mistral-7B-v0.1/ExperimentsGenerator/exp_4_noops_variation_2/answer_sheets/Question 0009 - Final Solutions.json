Let's start with the number of people kicked out for not wearing masks. From the problem statement, we know there were 3 customers kicked out for not wearing masks. Next, let's figure out the number of shoplifters. The problem says a number equals to four times that many minus 5 were kicked out for shoplifting. That means the number of shoplifters was 4 times that many minus 5, or 4x - 5. Finally, let's figure out the number of people kicked out for physical violence. The problem states three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence. That means the number of people kicked out for physical violence was 3 times the number of shoplifters, or 3(4x - 5). Now that we have all the information we need, let's put it together. We can see that the number of people kicked out for not wearing masks was 3. The number of shoplifters was 4x - 5. And the number of people kicked out for physical violence was 3(4x - 5). Now, if a total of 50 people were kicked out of the Walmart, how many were kicked out for other reasons? To find this, we subtract the numbers of people kicked out for not wearing masks, shoplifting, and physical violence from 50. So the number of people kicked out for other reasons is 50 - 3 - (4x - 5) - 3(4x - 5), or 50 - 3 - 4x + 5 - 12x + 15. Simplifying, we get 15 - 12x.
