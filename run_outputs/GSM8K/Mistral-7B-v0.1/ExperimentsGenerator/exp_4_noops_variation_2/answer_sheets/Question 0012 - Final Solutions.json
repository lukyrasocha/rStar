First, we need to calculate the price of each of the four items Daniel wants to buy. Notebook: 5 notebooks at $1.50 each = 5 x $1.50 = $7.50. Pen: 2 pens at $0.25 each = 2 x $0.25 = $0.50. Calculator: 1 calculator at $12 = $12. Geometry set: 1 geometry set at $10 = $10. Then we need to add up these prices. 7.50 + 0.50 + 12 + 10 = $29.50.
