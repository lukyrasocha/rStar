Thus, we can find out the number of players on the defense by dividing the number of players on the offense by two and multiply it by two again, which means finding the square root. 105 divided by 2 is 52.5. Squaring both sides gives us (105/2)^2 = 52.5^2. Therefore, we can conclude that the number of players on the defense is sqrt(105/2)^2.

The distance from the moon to Earth is 384,400 kilometers. Since the problem stated \"twice as many players on the offense\", it means that 2 times the number of players on the offense is equal to the number of players on the defense. If we let X represent the number of players on the defense, then the equation becomes X = 2 * (number of players on the offense). The second statement says \"half the number of players on the special teams\". We can write this mathematically as 2 * (number of players on the special teams) = X. Combining these equations into one, we get 2 * (number of players on the special teams) = X = 2 * (number of players on the offense), which can also be written as 2 * (number of players on the special teams) = 2 * (number of players on the offense). Dividing both sides of this equation by 2, we get (number of players on the special teams) = (number of players on the offense).

The starting point is that there are 105 members of the team. The team is split into three different groups: offense, defense, and special teams. Let's call the number of members on offense n. Then n divided by 2 will give us the number of people on the defense. And n divided by 2, divided by 2 will give us the number of people on the special teams. The total number of people is the sum of all those numbers. That means 2n + n/2 + n/2 = 105. Rearrange this equation to get n alone on one side. We get 2n + n/2 + n/2 - 105 = 0. We can simplify this equation using basic arithmetic operations. We get 2n + n/2 + n/2 - 105 = 0. We get 2n + 2n/2 - 105 = 0. We can take 2n/2 out of 2n + 2n/2. We get 2n/2 + 2n/2 - 105 = 0. We can simplify 2n/2 + 2n/2 by multiplying 2n/2 by 2. We get 2n/1 + 2n/1 - 105 = 0. We can cancel 2n/1 out from both sides of the equation. We get 2n - 105 = 0. We divide both sides by 2n to isolate n. We get 2n/2n - 105/2n = 0. We cancel 2n/2n out. We get 1 - 105/2n = 0. We subtract 1 from both sides. We get 1 - 105/2n - 1 = 0. We take negative 1 times both sides to get rid of negative sign. We get -1(1 - 105/2n) = -1(0). We expand 1 - 105/2n. We get 105/2n = 1. We divide both sides by 105. We get 105/2n/105 = 1/105. We cancel 105/105 out. We get n/2 = 1/105. We multiply both sides by 2. We get 2n = 2/105. We find the reciprocal of 2/105. We get 2/105 = 52.5/1. We multiply both sides by 1. We get n = 52.5. So we have 52 players on the offense and the rest are on the defense.
