To figure out the answer, let's first calculate how many cookies Sue's sister ate each day. According to the instructions, Sue ate 5 cookies on Monday and 13 on Tuesday.

So, she ate 4 x 5 = 20 cookies. Then, on Tuesday, according to the instructions, she ate 2 times as many cookies as her sister. So she ate 2 x 18 = 36. We can also find the answer directly using Sue's calorie intake of 200 calories per cookie. First, we can subtract the amount of calories that Sue's sister consumed during both days to get Sue's calorie consumption difference from her sister. Since Sue's sister ate 5 cookies on Monday and 13 on Tuesday, she would consume 5 x 200 = 1000 calories on Monday and 13 x 200 = 2600 on Tuesday, so she would consume 1000 + 2600 = 3600 calories over two days. Since Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister on Monday, this means that Sue consumed 4 x 5 = 20 cookies on Monday, and since she ate 2 times as many as her sister on Tuesday, this means that she ate 2 x 13 = 26 cookies on Tuesday.
