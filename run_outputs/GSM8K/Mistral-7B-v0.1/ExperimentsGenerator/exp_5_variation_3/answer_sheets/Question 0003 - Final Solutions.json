The problem says he spends 2 hours watching TV each day. Next, we have to figure out how much time Jim spends reading. To get to this, we can look for clues in the problem statement. It says that he reads for half as long as he watches TV. This means if he watches TV for 2 hours, he reads for 1 hour. We also know that he spends 3 days a week doing both activities. Putting all of these together, we see that Jim spends (2 hours * 3 days) or 6 hours a week watching TV. Similarly, he spends (1 hour * 3 days) or 3 hours a week reading.

We can express that mathematically using a variable as follows:\n\ntime_reading = 1/2 * time_watching_tv\n\nWe also know that the total amount of time Jim spends on these activities in one week is 2 hours watching TV plus the amount of time spent reading.
