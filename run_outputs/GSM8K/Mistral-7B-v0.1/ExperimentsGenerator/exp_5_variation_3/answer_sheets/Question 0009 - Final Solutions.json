Next, we need to find the speed of light. According to the problem statement, the speed of light is 299,792 kilometers per second. Then we need to find 4 times that many minus 5. We can simply multiply 4 and 299,792 to get 1,199,168, and subtract 5 from it to get 1,199,163. Finally, we need to find three times the number of shoplifters. The problem says three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale, so we can simply multiply 3 and 1,199,163 to get 3,597,489. Then we can subtract 50 from 3,597,489 to get the total number of people were kicked out of the Walmart for other reasons. This equals to 3,597,489 - 50 = 3,597,439.

The problem states 3 customers were kicked out of the Walmart for refusing to wear masks. So there were 3 people who were kicked out for not wearing masks. 3 is less than 50. So we know that the number of people who were kicked out for shoplifting is greater than zero. Let's call that number X. Four times X minus 5 equals the number of people who were kicked out for shoplifting. So, X equals the number of people who were kicked out for shoplifting divided by 4 plus 5. That means, X equals (the number of people who were kicked out for shoplifting) / 4 + 5. So, we need to find out the number of people who were kicked out for shoplifting first. Let's find the number of people who were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. The problem states three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. Since we know the number of shoplifters, we can find the number of people who were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale by multiplying the number of shoplifters by three. The number of people who were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale is equal to 3 times the number of shoplifters. So, it's equal to 3 times the number of shoplifters. And the number of shoplifters is equal to 4 times the number of people who were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale, minus 5. So, the number of shoplifters equals 4 times the number of people who were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale, minus 5. We found earlier that the number of people who were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale was equal to 3 times the number of shoplifters. So, we know that 3 times the number of shoplifters equals 4 times the number of people who were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale, minus 5. Solving for the number of shoplifters, we get 3 times the number of shoplifters is equal to 4 times the number of people who were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale, minus 5. Dividing both sides by 3, we get the number of shoplifters equals 4 times the number of people who were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale, minus 5, divided by 3. That means, the number of shoplifters equals the number of people who were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale, divided by 3, minus 5. So, the number of shoplifters is equal to the number of people who were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale, divided by 3, minus 5. We already found that the number of people who were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale is equal to 3 times the number of shoplifters. So, 3 times the number of shoplifters is equal to 3 times the number of people who were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. Using this information, we can solve for the number of shoplifters. 3 times the number of shoplifters is equal to 3 times the number of people who were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. Dividing both sides by 3, we get the number of shoplifters is equal to the number of people who were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale, divided by 3. So, the number of shoplifters is equal to the number of people who were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale, divided by 3. We already found that the number of shoplifters is equal to 4 times the number of people who were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale, minus 5, divided by 3. So, 4 times the number of people who were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale, minus 5, divided by 3 is equal to the number of people who were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale, divided by 3. Let's remove common denominators, to make our equation simpler. Both sides are divided by 3. So, 4 times the number of people who were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale, minus 5 is equal to the number of people who were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. 4 times the number of people who were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale, minus 5, equals the number of people who were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale.

Four times the number of those customers minus 5 was the number of customers kicked out for not wearing masks.

Since we need to know how many were kicked out for other reasons if all the people were kicked out for refusing to wear masks, let's calculate how many people were kicked out for refusing to wear masks. We know that three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. Let's call this number x. That means 50 - 3x (3 times the number of shoplifters) is the number of shoplifters. Let's call this number y. Finally, let's call the number of mask refusers z. So we know that 50 - 3y (3 times the number of shoplifters) = z. Substitute y for 50 - 3x (the number of shoplifters), and you get z = 50 - 3(50 - 3x). Simplify to get z = 150 - 9x. Now, what is z if all people were kicked out for refusing to wear masks? Well, all the 50 people were kicked out for refusing to wear masks, so z = 150 - 9(50) = 0. Our hint tells us that if z = 0, then the answer is 0.

No one was kicked out for refusing to wear masks. 50 people were kicked out for refusing to wear masks. Since 3 times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale, there were 3x shoplifters. How many people would be kicked out for shoplifting? 3x is how many people would be kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. It's not hard to figure out the rest. Use these numbers to find out how many people were kicked out for shoplifting and how many were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. You will get 3x = 4x - 5 and 3x = 5x - 3. Solve them both, you will get x = 3/5 and 5. Plug these into our equation 50 - 3x (3 times the number of shoplifters) = z to get 50 - 3(3/5) = z and 50 - 3(5) = z. These equal 30 and 10 respectively.

Since we cannot have a negative number of customers, this approach doesn't work.\n\nLet's try another approach:\n\nThere are a total of 50 customers who were kicked out of the Walmart.\nWe know that light travels at a speed of about 299,792 kilometers per second.\nThis means we can find the number of seconds it would take for light to travel a distance of 50 kilometers: 50 / 299,792 = 0.16652 seconds.\nSince there were 50 customers kicked out, this means the time between each customer being kicked out is 0.16652 seconds.\nNow we need to determine how long it took for three customers to be kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale.\nThe time it takes for three customers to be kicked out is 3 x 0.16652 = 0.5 seconds.\nSince the time taken by the last three customers was also 0.5 seconds, we can say that the total time taken by all the customers is 50 x 0.16652 = 8.326 seconds.\nTo calculate the number of customers who were kicked out for other reasons, we can divide the total time taken (8.326 seconds) by the time it takes to kick out one customer (0.16652 seconds).\nThis gives us 8.326 / 0.16652 = 50.
