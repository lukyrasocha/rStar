There are approximately 7.8 billion people on earth. 5 notebooks cost 5 * 1.5 = 7.5 dollars each. Two pens cost 2 * 0.25 = 0.5 dollars each. A calculator costs 12 dollars each. A geometry set costs 10 dollars each. Daniel is an engineering student. He buys 5 notebooks for $1.5 each, 2 pens for $0.25 each, 1 calculator for $12 each, and 1 geometry set for $10 each. This totals up to 7.5 + 0.5 + 12 + 10 = 29.5 dollars. Since the shop gives a 10% discount on all purchased items, 10% of 29.5 is 2.95 dollars. Thus the discount amount is 2.95 dollars.
