After 60 days, the total amount spent on ice cream is:\n\n1. First let's figure out how many servings of ice cream Cynthia will eat in 60 days. This is because we want to know how many cartons of ice cream Cynthia needs to buy. To get this, multiply the number of servings of ice cream per carton (15) by the number of days (60). This will tell us how many servings of ice cream Cynthia will need to eat in 60 days. 15 servings per carton x 60 days = 900 servings of ice cream.\n\n2. Next, let's calculate how many cartons of ice cream Cynthia needs to buy. To get this, divide the number of servings of ice cream Cynthia will eat in 60 days (900) by the number of servings of ice cream per carton (15). This will tell us how many cartons of ice cream Cynthia needs to buy. 900 / 15 = 60 cartons of ice cream.\n\n3. Now that we know how many cartons of ice cream Cynthia needs to buy, let's figure out how much the cartons will cost. Each carton costs $4.0. Therefore, the total cost of the cartons will be 60 cartons x $4.0 = $240.00.\n\n4. Finally, let's add up all these costs to get the total amount spent on ice cream after 60 days. The total amount spent on ice cream after 60 days is 60 cartons x $4.0 = $240.00.\n\nSo the total amount spent on ice cream after 60 days is $240.00.", "value": 0.28125}}}, "rollout_id": 15}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night.
