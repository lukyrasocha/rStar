For example, if you want to know the price of 5 notebooks, multiply 5 times the price of one notebook, which is $1.50. The other items are pen ($0.25), calculator ($12), geometry set ($10). The total price is 5 times $1.50, plus 2 times $0.25, plus 1 time $12, plus 1 time $10. That is, $7.5, plus $0.5, plus $12, plus $10. The total price is $29.50. Now we can apply the 10% discount to that amount, so $29.50 gets reduced by 10%, or 0.1*$29.50=$2.95. So the total price is $29.50-$2.95 = $26.55.

One notebook is sold at 1.5 dollars each, a pen at 0.25 dollars each, a calculator at 12 dollars each, and a geometry set at 10 dollars each. Daniel is an engineering student, and Daniel wants to buy 5 notebooks, 2 pens, 1 calculator, and 1 geometry set. The shop gives a 10% discount on all the purchased items. Daniel's notebooks would cost 1.5 dollars each. 5 x 1.5 is 7.5. Pens would cost 0.25 dollars each. 2 x 0.25 is 0.5. Calculators would cost 12 dollars each. 1 x 12 is 12. Geometry sets would cost 10 dollars each. 1 x 10 is 10. The amount spent before discount is 7.5 + 0.5 + 12 + 10 = 29.5. That is 29.5 dollars. With 10% discount, the amount spent is (1 - 0.1) x 29.5 = 26.55. The answer is: 26.55.", "value": 0.28125}}}, "rollout_id": 21}]
