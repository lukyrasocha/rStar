To calculate the mass of food in grams, we can use the following expression: Mass in grams = Calories / Energy in Kcal per gram. This energy value varies depending on the type of food.

To figure out the answer, let's first calculate how many cookies Sue's sister ate each day. According to the instructions, Sue ate 5 cookies on Monday and 13 on Tuesday. So her sister ate 5 + 13 = 18 cookies. Next, we need to know how many cookies Sue ate on each day. On Monday, according to the instructions, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister. So, she ate 4 x 5 = 20 cookies. Then, on Tuesday, according to the instructions, she ate 2 times as many cookies as her sister. So she ate 2 x 18 = 36. We can also find the answer directly using Sue's calorie intake of 200 calories per cookie. First, we can subtract the amount of calories that Sue's sister consumed during both days to get Sue's calorie consumption difference from her sister. Since Sue's sister ate 5 cookies on Monday and 13 on Tuesday, she would consume 5 x 200 = 1000 calories on Monday and 13 x 200 = 2600 on Tuesday, so she would consume 1000 + 2600 = 3600 calories over two days. Since Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister on Monday, this means that Sue consumed 4 x 5 = 20 cookies on Monday, and since she ate 2 times as many as her sister on Tuesday, this means that she ate 2 x 13 = 26 cookies on Tuesday.

Next, we can find out how many cookies Sue ate on Tuesday. We know that on Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister. Sue ate 20 cookies on Monday and her sister ate 5 cookies on Monday.

On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister. There are about 7.8 billion people on Earth.

If 1 cookie has 200 calories, how many more calories did Sue consume than her sister? To get the exact numbers, we need to know the population of Earth. Since we don't know the exact population of Earth, we use approximations. We can assume the population is around 8 billion. We also need to determine how much Sue and her sister ate on each day. On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister. Her sister ate 5 cookies on Monday. Therefore, Sue ate 4 * 5 = 20 cookies on Monday. On Tuesday, Sue ate 2 times as many cookies as her sister. Her sister ate 13 cookies on Tuesday. Therefore, Sue ate 2 * 13 = 26 cookies on Tuesday. We also need to know the calorie content of cookies. One cookie contains 200 calories. On Monday, Sue consumed 20 * 200 = 4000 calories. On Tuesday, Sue consumed 26 * 200 = 5200 calories.

So Sue ate 20 + 26 = 46 cookies in two days. To figure out how many calories Sue consumed, we need to know how many calories are in one cookie. According to the question, it's 200. Since there are 46 cookies, this means Sue consumed 200 * 46 = 9200 calories. Her sister ate 5 + 13 = 18 cookies over two days, which is 200 * 18 = 3600 calories.
