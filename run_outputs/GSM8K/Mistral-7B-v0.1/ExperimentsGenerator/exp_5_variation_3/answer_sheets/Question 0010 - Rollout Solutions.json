It is half of the class. So we have 40 / 2 = 20 out of 40 people like blue. Then we can remove the 20 people who liked blue from the class and look at the remaining people. Of those remaining, one-fourth likes green. Since there are 40 people total in the class, we can say that one-fourth of the remaining (or 20) likes green. So 1/4 of 20, which is 5.

Let's focus on the last part of the question. Half of the class likes blue, one quarter of the remaining likes green, and the rest likes yellow. So let's figure out the number of students who likes yellow first. We know that half of the class likes blue. There are 40 students in the class, so there are 20 students who like blue. Next, we need to find the number of students who like green. Since one-fourth of the remaining likes green, we need to subtract 20 from 40 to find the remaining number of students. This leaves us with 20 students who don't like blue, meaning that they either like green or yellow. Of those 20 students, one-fourth like green. So 20/4 is 5, meaning that 5 students like green.
