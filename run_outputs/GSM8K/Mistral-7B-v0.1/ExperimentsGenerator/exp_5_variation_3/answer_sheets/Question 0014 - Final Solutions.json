The first part of the question can be solved using algebraic expressions. There are three kangaroos and they each move at the same speed. Their combined speed will be three times as fast or 3x faster than one kangaroo. Each kangaroo covers a distance of 3x m/h. They covered a distance of 3x * 18 h = 54x m in 18 hours. We know the distance is 8,848 m, which means the expression 54x m = 8,848 needs to hold true. Dividing both sides by 54x yields 1 = 8,848 / 54x. This simplifies to x = 192. Therefore, each kangaroo moves at 192 mph.\n\nNow we know the speed of each kangaroo. To find out how long it takes four turtles, each moving at half the speed of a kangaroo, we need to divide the time taken by kangaroos by two. Since kangaroos covered 54x m in 18 hours, the four turtles would cover half that distance in double the amount of time. That would make 54x / 2 m in 36 h. But since a kangaroo moved 192 mph, a turtle would only cover 192/2 mph. Plugging these numbers into the expression yields 54x / 2 = 192/(192/2)h or 54x / 2 = 192 / 1.92h. Simplifying yields x = 18h.
