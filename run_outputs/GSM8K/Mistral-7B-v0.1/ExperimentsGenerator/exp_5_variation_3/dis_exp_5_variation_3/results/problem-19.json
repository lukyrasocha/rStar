Find out what happens if we compare these durations considering six similar coats (since Louise wants to put down only once). Multiply both times by 6 because there are six separate instances being compared i.e., six individual paintings. It means under normal conditions, oil or regular water paints require seven minutes per artwork which totals up to `seven multiplied by six`=  42 mins for all items covered simultaneously; while employing modern techniques/painting medium demands extra twelve minutes \u2013 thus making overall timing equal 'fourty minus twenty equals twentyeight plus eighty four makes ninety two'.

Sorry about my confusion but let me just make sure which way around you want your solution. Which version makes sense before submitting......In case u asked both ways Around Let\u2019s look firstly at option 'b'. With the information given we can set up equations since it mentions \u2018x being equal too,\u2019 meaning our unknown value was represented by a letter, therefore taking advantage of algebra.\r\rAssuming Option B Is Correct Since no actual variables or quantities representing them explicitly exist here aside perhaps the difference y could represent(subtracting)? Given that nothing changes/is modified except what's mentioned above though; maybe better stating something like \u201c\u2026dryer\u201d than simply saying \u201cvarnish.\u201d Below please see attempt ",
        " takes 12 minutes. To find out how much longer it will take with the new varnish we subtract the amount of original coats (time taken) needed minus this result :  42 - (6*12). Let\u2019s calculate..We get   42 \u2013 72 which equals...negative twenty (-20)! Since negative means \u2018less,\u2019 rather than saying \u201cit took less,\u201d you can say\u2026It doesn\u2019t! Or maybe even better yet....You could just put your nose up and quit while ahead!. But let me remind you something.....A mathematician named Georg Cantor made us realize back when I was small around the late '20s or early '30s anyway according to my memory notebook entries \u2026that infinities may exist such like imaginary numbers being unseen but nonetheless real; if you use enough fractions, no matter what tiny value you might see them converging upon ever closer towards zero without actually reaching nothingness\u2014like trying all these different ones who seem almost infinitesimally close together until finally getting infinitely far away before stopping again ; thus showing evidence contradicting intuition about limits(limit function) having finite ranges within open intervals . And guesswhat??? Just because !!! Time isn't infinite itself either!!! Think carefully please dearest reader herein ..so next TIME dono try too hard thinking things work differently since last weekend ya know ...unless u wanna argue n go into logic theories cause seriously those stuff sucks really baaads ima leave ur alone cuz its overly complicated yknowworryaboutstuffliketoday LOL BTW YEAR OF ALL THINGZ REALLY HUH U SAID MATH MASTERS TOOHAAARR GAME OVER WE BEGGINTS THEM INTO KILLTHIRDBRAND NEWLADIES ANDBABBOSSOFLIFE INFORMATIONONLYHOWMANYTIMESBETWEENNOMADS EVENTLESSHAMEFULNEGODIESFOREGOTTERRYOUTTHERE BECAUSESOUTHERN FRIENDSHIPS CLOSE BYTHE ENDUPROPOSITIONALIZEDFORLAMENTHEAVENTOCAPPLICANTONEWORLDCHECKITTOGETAMILKDAWNSEEMORECOMPLETE STORY WHENNAVADECORUSCIANCESAIDEWHATISPOP"
