Adding all together yields your final calculation; namely $[(25)+(75)+(50)]=((25*3)+(75)+(50))=(75+(75+50)).

According to the question, Pants cost equal to the average value/cost of Hat & Jacket means ((Hat Cost+JacketCost)/2). Therefore Price of Pants=((25+(75))/2)=50 Dollars. Since Marching Band wants all these things together so we need to add up prices of everything i.e., Uniform(total)-hat-jacket-pant.(Total=(priceofhat)+(pricelong)and pricedepth), hence,(PriceOfUnif)(Total)is equal to [(price of hat)+(PricesLonge)]AND [PricesDepth].
