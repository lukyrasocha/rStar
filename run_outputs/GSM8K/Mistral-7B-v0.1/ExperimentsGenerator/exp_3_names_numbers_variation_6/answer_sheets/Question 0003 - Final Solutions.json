Paul spends 2 hours watching TV and then decides to go to bed and reads for half as long. He does this 2 times a week. Let's first determine how much time he spends on TV each week. He watches TV for 2 hours every week. So, he spends 2 hours on TV every week. Let's next determine how much time he spends reading per week. He reads for half as long as he watched TV. Since he watches TV for 2 hours, he reads for 2 / 2 = 1 hour per week. So, he spends 1 hour reading every week. Finally, let's determine how much time he spends on TV and reading in 25 weeks. Since he watches TV and reads twice a week, he spends 2 * (2 + 1) = 4 hours on TV and reading per week. So, he spends 4 * 25 = 100 hours on TV and reading in 25 weeks.
