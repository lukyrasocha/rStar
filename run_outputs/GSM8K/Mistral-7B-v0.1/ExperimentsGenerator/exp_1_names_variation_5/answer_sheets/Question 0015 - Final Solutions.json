Firstly, we need to find out how much money James earns per sunflower for both the sunflower and the bouquet. For the sunflower, it is $2 per sunflower, and for the bouquet, it is $8 per bouquet. Since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, we can say that James earns $8/12 or $0.66 per sunflower from the bouquets.\nNow that we know how much James earns per sunflower for both types of flowers, we can calculate the total earnings per sunflower. James earns $2 per sunflower from the sunflower and $0.66 per sunflower from the bouquets. Therefore, the total earnings per sunflower is $2 + $0.66 = $2.66.\nNext, we use the total earnings per sunflower to calculate how many sunflowers James sold on each day. On the first day, he sold $26 / $2.66 = 9.74 sunflowers. On the second day, he sold $26 / $2.66 = 9.74 sunflowers.
