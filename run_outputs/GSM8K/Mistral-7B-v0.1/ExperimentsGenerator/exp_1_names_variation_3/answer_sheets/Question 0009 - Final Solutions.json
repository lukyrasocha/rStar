We know that 4 times as many people were kicked out for shoplifting as the number of people who refused to wear masks. This means that the number of people who refused to wear masks is half of the number of people who were kicked out for shoplifting. If we can find the number of people who were kicked out for shoplifting, then we can use this relationship to find the number of people who refused to wear masks. And once we know these numbers, it should be easy to figure out the other information. Let's start by finding the number of people who were kicked out for shoplifting. If a total of 50 people were kicked out of the Walmart, then 50 minus the number of people who were kicked out for other reasons is the number of people who were kicked out for shoplifting. So if we subtract 3 times the number of shoplifters from the total, we get the number of people who were kicked out for other reasons. That is, 50 - (3 * the number of shoplifters) = the number of people who were kicked out for other reasons. Since a total of 50 people were kicked out of the Walmart, we know that 50 - (3 * the number of shoplifters) = 50. This equation can be rearranged to become (3 * the number of shoplifters) = 50 - 50. So the number of shoplifters is 0. If the number of shoplifters is 0, then the number of people who refused to wear masks is also 0.
