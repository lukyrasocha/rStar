That means her sister had only 1/4 as many cookies as Sue. If her sister had 5 cookies, then Sue would have 5 * (4 / 1) = 20 cookies. Sue preferred chocolate chip cookies and her sister liked oatmeal raisin. So if each cookie has 200 calories, and Sue had 20 cookies, she would eat 20 * 200 = 4000 calories on Monday. If her sister had 5 cookies, then she would eat 5 * 200 = 1000 calories. Thus, she consumed 4000 - 1000 = 3000 calories more than her sister.
