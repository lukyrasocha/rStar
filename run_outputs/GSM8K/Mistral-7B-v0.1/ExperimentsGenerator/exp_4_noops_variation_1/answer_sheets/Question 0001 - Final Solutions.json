Each carton costs $4.00, and there are 60 days in total. Since she consumes one serving of ice cream every night, she must have consumed 60 servings of ice cream. This means that she would need to buy 60 / 15 = 4 cartons of ice cream, which would cost 4 * $4.00 = $16.00. So, Cynthia spends $16.00 on ice cream in 60 days. If she purchased chocolate flavor ice cream instead, each carton would cost $3.00. Then she would need to buy 60 / 15 = 4 cartons of chocolate flavor ice cream, which would cost 4 * $3.00 = $12.00. So, Cynthia spends $12.00 on chocolate flavor ice cream in 60 days. The total amount she spends on ice cream in 60 days is $16.00 + $12.00 = $28.00.
