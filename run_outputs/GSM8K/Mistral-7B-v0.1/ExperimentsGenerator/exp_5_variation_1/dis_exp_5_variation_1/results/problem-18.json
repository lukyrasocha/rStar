        " find out exactly how many questions this corresponds to (percentage multiplied by quantity). This comes down to finding 60/100*70 which equals 42. However, if you want us to only focus on answering your question related strictly to getting through grades without involving extraneous details like information regarding distance of moon, it would make calculation process clearer as follows: Find the minimum required score necessary to advance i.e., calculate what represents 70%. Since audrey needs to obtain overall 70%, let\u2019s assume 'x' refers to passing scores needed across both exams cumulatively.
