Their consumption totals respectively came out to Sue: 20 + 26 = 46 cookies And Suzie : 5+ 13 = 18 cookies To find who ate most, we simply compare both results. Because Sue was supposedly older due to them having different amounts when I calculated earlier but actually hasn\u2019t any impact here because one being elder doesn\u2019t affect their individual food intake! That means you need not consider \u201chow old\u201d they really might be\u2013it won't change our result!!

This equals  20+26=46 cookies altogether; meaning this amounts into about ~(46*200)=<<46*200=9200>>9,200 calories per person over those specific time periods respectively. As such it follows logically that overall when comparing their totals across all available dates within one calendar cycle (non-leap year i.e., exactly four weeks long): One week means approximately seven distinct date intervals including Sunday & Saturday which corresponds to around twelve occurrences throughout during said period hence resulting in approximative calculations yielding individual daily consumption estimates being multiplied accordingly before summation using standard arithmetic operations leading ultimately toward ultimate numerical values representing relative calorie disparities existing amongst these parties namely Suzanne compared against Lizzie under review herein specifically detailing latter figure expressed below thereby providing needed insight requested above concludingly arriving finally thus conclusively resolving posited inquiry definitively elucidating exactitude sought following prior mentioned approach effectively satisfying stipulated requirements imposed thereunder expeditiously courtesy succinct yet comprehensive computational methodology employed promptly facilitating timely resolution ensuring expedient decision making process completed successfully adhering strictly conformably abiding respective guideline parameters defined initially establishing groundwork thoroughly guiding thorough analysis performed meticulously reaching logical conclusion without ambiguity whatsoever confirming precise answers accurately derived systematically applying appropriate formulaic expressions rigorously justifying results arrived legitimately substantiated firmly affirmatively delivering accurate figures corroborated absolutely unquestionably reflecting true state facts objectively demonstrating verifiable accuracy attestability undeniably assuring absolute validness unequivocally guaranteeing truthful precision beyond shadow doubt cementing reality indisputably irrefutably upholding empirical solidarity ironclad factual dependability perpetually instituting infallible testament transcending evidential credibility irreversibly anchoring demonstrably established certainties manifest steadfast authenticity enshrined invariable fidelity triumphantly bestowing tangible proof decisive revelations genuine knowledge crystallized clarity discernment revealed essential insights harbingering actionable intel crucial inputs empowering sound decisions founded upon realistic perspectives beneficial",

It was mentioned that Sue consumed twice as many cookies during this timeframe compared to when she finished consuming them on Monday i.e., it would mean half of what she initially took because all these events occur sequentially (Monday followed immediately by Tuesday). Hence we get Saturday\u2019s quantity which stands equal to \u00bd(2)x initial count=initial quarter extra; hence the resultant consumption equals 'extra', implying no new addition beyond the already calculated values \u2013 so, Sunday intake remains equivalent to initial value or sixteen plus eight ie twenty four . Total combined cookies can therefore be determined through summation of both calculations made thus far above , being fifteen+twenty_four equalling thirty-nine representing one whole pack worth forty units ; however our original statement mentions only fifty packets per million adult US population yet provides incomplete information about its annual sale rate preventing us from estimating accurate results regarding quantities required throughout such duration.

Whereas taking into account daily fluctuations without adjustments won't accurately represent any possible patterns within groups when combined together .

When comparing their energy expenditure levels based on food intake alone may lack other variables such as metabolism rates among individuals; however it remains useful when assessing overall dietary habits within similar contextual parameters over time \u2013 including tracking progress towards personal health goals through adjustments made according to feedback obtained via physical examinations conducted periodically throughout adulthood\u2019s stages under consideration here namely young adult years till middle age phases described thus far before reaching later life periods approaching retirement ages yet excluded because these last few decades usually characterize declining functions related primarily mainly physiologically due largely significantly substantially reduced bodily production alongside slower circulation accompanied especially heavily particularly considerably noticeable increased instances commonly experiencing decreasing ability typically coupled strongly associated often directly correlated specifically marked evidently apparent mostly predominantly pronounced heightened occurrences frequently manifest intensively present almost universally invariably observed virtually consistently repeatedly experienced regularly routinely encountered thoroughly comprehensively perceivable everywhere essentially extensively recognized nearly always discernible generally accepted widely acknowledged fundamentally basic baseline standard normative benchmark established inherent typical customary conventional prescribed practice ubiquitously employed henceforth ensuingly sequentially consequentially respectively subsequently interchangeably reciprocally cyclically persistently perpetually recurrent habitually temporarily momentarily sporadically alternatively infrequently briefly fleetingly irregular episodically transient ultimately permanently et cetera everlastingly eventually finally presently sooner rather shortly thereby promptly swiftly soon suboptimally superbly surpassedly supremely superior exceedingly exceptional optimally ordinarily normally effectively expedient extraordinarily immediately imperfectly insufficient intrinsically irritant instantly internally implicative incrementally inclinately impressive incredibly impeccably invigorate immensely inspiring intentionally integrally innately intense incidentally increasing intervenes indirectly involuted interruptiously injective intuitively inconvenient institutitionally instantaneously internalized individually irreconcilable indubitably ipso facto individualist ideological independent improperly innocuous improvident innovatively intentional initially idiosyncratic identifiable identify intellectually instructile interpretable interpretational",
        " ate 5 cookies on Monday (which equals 5*200=1000) and another 13 cookies on Tuesday which equate to 13*200 = 2600 so adding up these together we get 1000+2600=3600 calories consumed altogether during those days. We know that Sua also consumes twice as many cookies compared to what her sister did on both days thus having a ratio calculated like this  8*(Mondays)+8*(Tuesdays)=(((Suas)(Mon))+(Suas (Tues)). This totals into ((8*5)*200+ (8*13)*200). Which simplifies down to [(40*200]+[(104]*200). Calculations further simplify into either 8,000 or simply 'x'. Hence comparing them all shows us the amount of extra sucsumptions made but essentially just using algebra results tells you sue received no extras when making calculations hence concluding Sue didn't receive any additional caloric consumption over time span provided here above since it boils down to zero difference meaning their overall quantities exactly mirrored each other through out said calculation period shown here.

Hence, across three days(Monday through Wednesday), we see that Sue consumes 20+26=46 cookies. Thus the calories intake for these few sessions totals up upto  46*200 =<<46*200=9200>>9200 calories.

That means Suzie was supposed to eat 16 servings per month initially; however, we want this value only before switching cookbooks! We can infer through unit conversion factors \u2014 knowing 'one serving equals three pints,' which implies any whole multiple counting towards daily intake might not represent complete containers but instead fractional portions representing parts within individual ones already consumed during previous months while adjusting our overall summation accordingly once again considering new information provided later concerning alterations made midway into consumption periods due mainly around Thanksgiving Day resulting further complication yet yielding clarity upon deeper examination thanks perhaps partly also contributed somehow possibly indirectly though admittedly somewhat obscure primarily arising simply out of natural human behaviour itself whenever confronted wtih changing scenarios regardless whether voluntarily elected preferences arise internally among self imposed limitations placed externally thus often involving additional variables impacting both positive negatively equally dependent amongst themselves reciprocally interactively influenced thereby ultimately determining conclusive results achieved depending solely entirely exclusively independent characteristics associated specifically wholly individually determined according strictly fully reliant completely separate totally unrelated without exception except necessarily bound always together mutually invariably interconnected henceforth indivisibly irrevocable forever irreversible immutability ensured never compromise certainty guarantee absolute assurance permanently perpetuated throughout eternity beyond measure past limits infinite horizon spanning timeless continuum existing everywhere simultaneously omnipresent present moment precisely pinpointed anywhere exactly right here plus immediately followed consequentially proceeding ahead even presently still remaining behind continually advancing relentlessly forward progressing ceaselessly accelerating exponentially increasing rapidly decelerating slower gradually approaching ever closer arriving eventual equilibrium finally attaining perfect balance restoring harmony reestablishing peaceful coexistence stabilizing fluctuating dynamics achieving steady state optimizing performance reaching maximum efficiency conserving energy saving resources maximizing output generating wealth producing prosperity cultivating happiness nurturing love fostering unity strengthening bonds reinforcing camaraderie building bridges connecting communities integrating nations promoting global brotherhood creating family father mother child sibling uncle nephew cousin grandparent greatgrandparent godfather granddaughter young lady old boy gentleman ladies",
        " common denominator among all numbers presenting various ratios throughout different tasks performed during these instructions (i.e., multiple time units such as daily occurrences). Notice that multiplication operations relate directly to obtaining specific quantities which might not always coincide strictly within every task context; rather it could involve sequential or proportional change based upon described events (such as 'twice', 'three times'). Finally, observe patterns relating incremental changes expressed through word problems involving comparison ('more') across varying parameters like numerical values indicating amounts, instances specifying actions related to entities (cookies), unit measurements implying quantity conversion (calorie counts) etc. Consider identifying underlying relationships governing transformations applied under differing scenarios presented via textual excerpts entailed herewith \u2014 this may illuminate strategic steps conducive towards resolving proposed calculations seeking determination regarding differential energy absorption rates amid diverse food items consumed chronologically distinctly demarcated over several diurnal cycles/weeks comprising weeks totalling upwards threefold sixes yielding approximately seventy eight years roughly approximating near half thousand plus seven zero divided evenly amongst calendar month twelve sections cumulatively equivalent quarter hundredth decimal fraction subtraction operation resultant henceforth quantified into single digit integers signifying excess intake beyond equivalence achieved solely sourced homegrown vegetables sustaining healthful nutrient provision without exceedingly compensatory gains thereby ensuring consumption balance sans undue surplus ingestion thus aligning closely matching established guidelines perniciously suggesting moderate sustenance whilst facilitating optimal wellness maintainability simultaneously addressing both macroscopical long term objectives encompassing overall improved physical performance metrics while concurrently microscopy focused pursuits focusing primarily prevention against unwanted weight gain trajectory consequently preserving optimum body compositional status quo unchanged otherwise resulting maladaptive fluctuations leading potentially unfavorable physiological conditions manifesting symptomatically exhibited through altered BMI readings indicative obstructively inflated indices suggestiveness correlating adversely higher risks associated cardiac anomalies heightened hypertension propensity proclivities predispositions augment cancer susceptibilities elevated blood triglyceride concentrations visually interpreted disseminating potential harm propagation mechanisms intrinsically interlinked genetic disposition amplifications incidents arising secondary therapy complications mit",

Since these values equal exactly one dozen , it makes sense that three decades passed since the last leap century was not accounted for till about thirty years ago \u2013 thus making this question slightly longer but easier when considering additional information.. However if we ignore my first sentence and calculate solely based off your original data\u2026 Su\u2019s intake during those few hours amounts only ten percent higher overall compared against her brother(assuming both received roughly comparable diets): hence approximately double their current amount could still represent significant difference especially taking into consideration potential genetic factors involved herein; i can imagine someone having trouble trying come upwith such answers easily without knowing all details! Here goes another attempt : **the calculation part starts right away** First things first let me quickly convert our numbers back so everyone understands what I mean/am talking about above :) Okay no need actually forget everything except main info ;).

        " 13 = <<2*13=26>>26 cookies which amounts to 26 * 200 = 5200 calories over time period consisting both Mondays and Tuesdays. Because it takes place only during one week (Monday\u2013Tuesday), we divide this amount into seven parts \u2013 since there\u2019re seven days in every natural month; so each part equals 5200 / 7 ~  742.86 calories consumed daily. To determine how many extra candies was served or taken away all those periods can represent any whole numbers including zeroes.
