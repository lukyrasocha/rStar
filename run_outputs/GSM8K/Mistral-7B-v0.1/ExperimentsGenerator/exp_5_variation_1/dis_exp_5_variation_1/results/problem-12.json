Applying the 10% discount means taking off 10/100 * $20 which equals $2. Therefore, subtracting this value from the original amount ($20), you get your actual spending power; so finally, Daniel needs to pay $20 - $2 = $18 altogether. But note here! Even though both sentences mention purchasing goods related to educational fields ('engineering class' mentioned indirectly through 'Daniel being an engineering student', even if irrelevant as buying textbooks isn\u2019t stated but could imply education materials beyond basic school necessities like these listed.), sentence B adds unnecessary information about calculating distance between Sun and Earth.
