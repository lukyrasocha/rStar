The difference is 12 - 7, which is 5 minutes. As stated in the question, Louise is applying the coat of varnish to six paintings, so if we multiply the additional 5 minutes by 6, we get 30 minutes.

Next, we need to know how long it takes for the coat of varnish on 6 paintings to dry with the old varnish. Since it takes 7 minutes for the coat of varnish on 1 painting to dry with the old varnish, it will take 6 * 7 = 42 minutes to dry on 6 paintings. We also know that it takes 12 minutes for the coat of varnish on 1 painting to dry with the new varnish. Finally, we can find the difference between the two times by subtracting 12 from 42. 42 - 12 is 30. So it will take 30 minutes more for the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish to dry than with the old varnish.
