Therefore, the fraction of pupils liking green is 1/4. Since we already found the number of pupils liking blue, we just need to subtract it from the original number of pupils to get the number of pupils remaining. That would be 40 - 20 = 20. So we multiply this number by the fraction of pupils liking green, which would be 20 * 1/4 = 5. Therefore, there are 5 pupils who like green. Lastly, we find the remaining pupils liking yellow. To do this, we take the original number of pupils and subtract both the number of pupils liking blue and the number of pupils liking green. This would be 40 - 20 - 5 = 15. The last fraction of pupils liking yellow would be one whole, so the fraction of pupils liking yellow would be 1/1 or just 1.
