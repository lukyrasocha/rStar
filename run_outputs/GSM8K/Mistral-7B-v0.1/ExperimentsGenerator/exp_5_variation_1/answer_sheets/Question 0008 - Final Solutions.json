We also know that there is half the number of players on the special teams as there is on the defense, so if we divide the number of players on the special teams by two, we will get the number of players on the defense. To find the number of players on the offense, we can multiply the number of players on the entire football team by two because there are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense. To find the number of players on the special teams, we can multiply the number of players on the entire football team by one quarter because there is half the number of players on the special teams as there is on the defense. We know that there are 105 players on the entire football team because it says that in the problem statement. 105 * 2 = 210 and 105 / 2 = 52.5, so let's round up to 53. 210 / 2 = 105 and 53 / 2 = 26.5, so let's round down to 26.

We can use this formula:\n\nd_miles / 1,000 x 0.62137119 = d_kilometers\n\nWhere d_miles is the distance in miles and d_kilometers is the distance in kilometers.\n\nNow let's find out how far away from Earth the moon is. The moon is approximately 384,400 km away from Earth. When we plug 384,400 km into our formula, we get:\n\n384,400 / 1,000 x 0.62137119 = 238,855.596 miles\n\nNext, let's calculate how many football players there are on the offense, defense, and special teams. The football team has 105 players. Half of those players are on the offense and defense, so the offense and defense together have 105/2 = 52.5 players. Since there are twice as many players on the offense as the defense, that means that there are 52.5 x 2 = 105 players on the offense. This also means that there are 105 - 105 = 0 players on the defense. Finally, there are half of the players on the defense who are on the special teams, which is 0 / 2 = 0 players. Therefore, there are no players on the special teams.\n\nWe have calculated that there are 105 players on the offense, 0 players on the defense, and 0 players on the special teams. We know that the sum of the numbers of players on the offense, defense, and special teams is always 105. The only way this can happen is if the number of players on the defense is 105. Thus, the number of players on the defense is 105.\n\nFinally, let's put everything together. We have found that there are 238,855.596 miles to the moon. That is about 400,000 kilometers. If we plug 400,000 kilometers into our formula, we get:\n\n400,000 / 1,000 x 0.62137119 = 249,992.499 miles\n\nThis means that the football team has 105 players.

You said the moon is 384,400 km away from Earth. We know it is around the same distance as 105 football players. To calculate this, we need to multiply the distance by the number of players per kilometer. Let's try a few different numbers until we get an answer close to 384,400.\n\nFirst, let's assume one player equals one kilometer.\n\n384,400/105 = 3,666.666666666665, so one player does not equal one kilometer.\n\nNext, let's try multiplying both sides by 1000 and dividing both sides by 100. This will give us a better estimate of how many players we need to reach 384,400.\n\n3666.666666666665/105*1000/100 = 3667.67, so one player does not equal 1 kilometer.\n\nNow let's try multiplying both sides by 1000 again and dividing both sides by 100.\n\n3667.67/105*1000/100 = 36676.7, so one player does equal 1 kilometer.\n\nSo there are 384,400/36676.7 = 10.5 players per kilometer.
