First we need to figure out how many hours Jim spent on reading per week. Since he spends twice as long reading as he watches tv, if he spends 2 hours watching tv, then he spends 2 / 2 = 1 hour reading. So he spends 2 + 1 = 3 hours on reading per week. Also, since he spends 3 times a week reading, then he spends 3 hours x 3 = 9 hours on reading per week. Now we can calculate how many hours Jim spends on reading in four weeks: 4 x 9 = 36. To convert the height of Mt. Everest into hours, we can use a conversion factor of 3600 seconds in an hour. Dividing 8,848 by 3600 gives us 2.457142857142857 hours.
