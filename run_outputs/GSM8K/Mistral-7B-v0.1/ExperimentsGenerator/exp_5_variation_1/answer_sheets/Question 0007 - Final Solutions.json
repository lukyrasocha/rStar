Next, we need to find out how many more cookies Sue consumed than her sister on both Monday and Tuesday. We know that Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister on Monday, so she ate 4 * 5 = 20 cookies. Similarly, on Tuesday, Sue ate 2 times as many cookies as her sister, or 2 * 13 = 26 cookies. This means that on Monday, Sue consumed 20 - 5 = 15 additional cookies, and on Tuesday she consumed 26 - 13 = 13 additional cookies. To calculate the total number of calories that Sue consumed, we multiply these values by the number of calories per cookie. The total number of calories that Sue consumed is therefore 15 * 200 = 3000 on Monday, and 13 * 200 = 2600 on Tuesday. The sum of these two amounts is 3000 + 2600 = 5600.
