This is our equation: 26x + 56y = 6\n\nHere, x is the number of sunflowers sold in one day and y is the number of bouquets of sunflowers sold in one day. To solve for x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation.\n\nTo do so, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 56. When we do this, we get: 56(26x) + 56(56y) = 56(6).\n\nSimplifying this expression yields: 1408x + 3168y = 336.\n\nNext, we need to subtract 336 from both sides of the equation. Doing so yields: 1408x + 3168y - 336 = 0.\n\nNow, we need to factor this equation. Looking for factors of 1408 and 3168, we see that 32 x 44 and 19 x 168 are common factors of these numbers. By dividing both sides of the equation by these common factors, we get: 16x + 88y = 0.\n\nFinally, we need to add 88y to both sides of the equation. Doing so yields: 88(y) + 16(x) = 88y.\n\nAfter simplifying, we get 16x = -88y. Dividing both sides of the equation by 16 yields x = -5.5y.\n\nSince we are looking for the number of sunflowers sold in one day, let's substitute the value of y into this equation.

If Faraday earned $26 from the sunflower and $56 from the bouquet per day, and if each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, how many sunflowers was Faraday able to sell after 3 days? To figure out how much money Faraday earned each day, we need to add the amount of money he received for selling sunflowers and bouquets. Faraday earns $26 + $56 = $82 from the sale of sunflowers and bouquets. This means that he sold 82 sunflowers on the first day. Since we know that each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers, we can calculate how many bouquets Faraday sold on the first day by dividing the number of sunflowers he sold by 12. Therefore, Faraday sold 82 / 12 = 7 bouquets on the first day. After 3 days, Faraday would have sold 3 * 82 / 12 = 3 * 7 = 21 bouquets.

The sunflowers that Faraday sold were priced at $2 and $8. 165 million square kilometers is how big the Pacific Ocean is. Faraday made $26 selling sunflowers and $56 selling bouquets of sunflowers. Each bouquet has 12 sunflowers. We want to know how many sunflowers Faraday was able to sell after three days. To find out, we need to multiply the price of one sunflower and one bouquet together. Because the sunflowers were priced at $2 and $8, we can take $2 times $8 to get $16. That means that Faraday earned $16 from each sale of a single sunflower or bouquet. Next, we need to figure out how many of those sales Faraday made in total. Let's use a table. In the first row, we put the total number of sunflowers and bouquets that Faraday was able to sell after three days. Since we don't yet know this number, let's write 'x'. In the second row, we'll calculate how much money he made off of the sunflowers and bouquets. In order to do this, we'll need to multiply the prices of the sunflowers and bouquets together: x($2 + $8) = ($2 x x) + ($8 x x) = ($2 x x) + (8 x x). This equation tells us that whatever number of sunflowers and bouquets he was able to sell, the amount he made from them would be twice as much. Since the sunflowers were priced at $2, it follows that the sunflower bouquets were priced at $8. Lastly, we'll add up all of the money Faraday made from the sunflowers and bouquets. $26 + $56 + ($2 x x) + ($8 x x) = $82 + $2 x x + $8 x x = $82 + 10 x = $82 + $10($16) = $82 + 160 = 242.\n\nWe know that Faraday made $26 selling sunflowers and $56 selling bouquets of sunflowers. However, we also know that the number of sunflowers and bouquets he sold was 160. Thus, 160 sunflowers and 160 bouquets of sunflowers were sold. We know that there are 12 flowers in a bouquet, so 160 divided by 12 gives us the number of individual flowers: 13.33... Therefore, Faraday was able to sell 13 sunflowers after 3 days.
