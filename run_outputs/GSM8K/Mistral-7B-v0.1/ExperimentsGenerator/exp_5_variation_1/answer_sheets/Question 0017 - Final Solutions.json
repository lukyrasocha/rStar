We know that Michael travels at 50 kilometers per hour. Let's say that it takes him T hours to travel the distance. We also know that the total distance is 6000 kilometers. We can set up an equation where T represents the amount of time it took Michael to travel the distance: 50T = 6000. By dividing both sides of the equation by 50, we get T = 120.
