The sun is 149.6 million kilometers away from the earth. It takes three kangaroos traveling at the same speed a total of 18 hours to travel across a highway.

To do this, we first need to figure out how fast the kangaroos can travel.

The speed of the kangaroos is unknown. However, we know that it takes them a total of 18 hours to cross the highway. Also, the kangaroos are going to travel 149.6 million kilometers. So that is equal to the sum of all three kangaroos's speeds multiplied by 18. So let's call that constant as K. We can express this equation as K = (Speed1 + Speed2 + Speed3) * 18. Next we know that the kangaroos are 3 times faster than the turtles. This means that for every hour the kangaroos cover, the turtles would cover 3 / 4 of that amount. To account for this, we need to divide the above equation by 3. Therefore, we have K / 3 = ((3 * Speed1) + (3 * Speed2) + (3 * Speed3)) / 4. Finally, this equation can be simplified to K / 3 = 3 * Speed1 + Speed2 + 3 * Speed3. Solving for Speed1, we get Speed1 = (K / 3 - Speed2 - 3 * Speed3) / 3. Plugging in our values of 18 hours and 149.6 million kilometers, we get Speed1 = (18 * 149.6e6 - Speed2 - 3 * 3 * Speed3) / 3. Dividing both sides by 3, we get Speed1 = 59.84 million km / hour - Speed2 / 3 - Speed3. This is the speed of the first kangaroo. Similarly, we can calculate the speeds of the other two kangaroos. Let's say the second kangaroo's speed is v1 and the third kangaroo's speed is v2. Following the same logic, we can write equations for v1 and v2: v1 = 59.84 million km / hour - 2 * Speed2 / 3 - 2 * Speed3 / 3 and v2 = 59.84 million km / hour - 2 * Speed2 / 3 - 3 * Speed3 / 3. Plugging in our known values, we get: v1 = 59.84 million km / hour - 2 * 18 / 3 - 2 * 3 / 3 = 47.07 million km / hour and v2 = 59.84 million km / hour - 2 * 18 / 3 - 3 * 3 / 3 = 43.27 million km / hour. Substituting these values back into the original equation, we get K = (v1 + v2 + v3) * 18 = (47.07 + 43.27 + v3) * 18. We can solve for v3 using algebra: v3 = (K - (47.07 + 43.27) * 18) / 18. Plugging in our known values, we get v3 = (18 * 149.6e6 - (47.07 + 43.27) * 18) / 18 = 10.46 million km / hour. So the kangaroos travel at speeds of 47.07 million km / hour, 43.27 million km / hour, and 10.46 million km / hour. So if 4 turtles took 18 hours, we can say that 4 turtles would take 4 * 18 = 72 hours to cover 149.6 million km. Since the turtles are only 1/2 of the speed of the kangaroos, we can say that it takes 4 turtles 4 * 18 * 2 / 2 = 72 hours to cover 149.6 million km. Thus, 4 turtles would take 72 hours to cover 149.6 million km, which is equivalent to traveling at 10.46 million km / hour.

Because 3 kangaroos took 18 hours to cross it together, that means it took them 18 / 3 = 6 hours. So each one needs 6 hours. Next, we can calculate how long it would take one turtle, traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo. The time taken for one turtle equals the time taken for one kangaroo divided by 2.
