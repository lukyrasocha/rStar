We want to get 70% of the total number of questions correct. The first test has 70 questions. 70 * 60% = 42 questions were answered correctly. The moon is 384,400 km from earth. The second test has 40 questions. If we knew how many questions we got right on the second test, we could use it to find out if 70% of the total number of questions was passed or not. To find out this, we have to do some calculations. Let's say we got x questions correct on the second test. (x / 40) * 100% = 70%. This means that we get 70% when we divide x by 40. That can also be written as 0.7 = x / 40. We multiply both sides with 40 to get the same equation in terms of x. 28 = x. So, if we get 28 questions correct on the second test, 70% of the total number of questions would be passed. The answer is: 28.\n\nHint: There are two ways to solve this problem. One way is to simply subtract 42 (number of correct answers on the first test) from 70 (total number of questions on the first test), which yields the desired result of 28 questions needed on the second test. Another way is to calculate what percentage of the total number of questions we got correct. This requires finding the total number of questions in both tests together. Let's call this number N. 70 + 40 = N. Next, let's calculate what percentage of these questions we got correct. (42 / N) * 100% = 70%. 42 / N = 70%. Multiplying both sides by N gives us 42 = 70% * N, which simplifies to 42 / 70 = N. 42 / 70 = 0.6. Finally, since we know that N is 70% of the total number of questions, 0.7*N = 70. 0.7*N = 70. 0.7 = N/100. Solving for N gives us 70 = 0.7*N. 70/0.7 = N. 100 = N.
