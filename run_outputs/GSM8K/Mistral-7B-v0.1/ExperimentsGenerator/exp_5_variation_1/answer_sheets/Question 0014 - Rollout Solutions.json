The sun is 149.6 million kilometers away from the earth. It takes three kangaroos traveling at the same speed a total of 18 hours to travel across a highway. I know these facts because they are explicitly stated in the problem.\n\nNext let's use what we know to calculate the rate at which the kangaroos can travel, and then calculate how long it would take four turtles, each traveling at half the speed of the kangaroos, to travel the same distance. To do this, we first need to figure out how fast the kangaroos can travel. We know that it takes them 18 hours to travel 149.6 million kilometers, so their average speed is (149.6 million kilometers)/(18 hours) = 8.322 million kilometers per hour. This means that they can travel 8.322 million kilometers every hour.\n\nNow that we know how fast the kangaroos can travel, we can calculate how long it would take four turtles, each traveling at half the speed of the kangaroos, to travel the same distance. Since each turtle can only travel half as far in the same amount of time as the kangaroos, it would take them twice as long to travel the same distance. So if it takes the kangaroos 18 hours to travel 149.6 million kilometers, it would take the four turtles (2*18) = 36 hours to do so.\n\nTo summarize, it took three kangaroos traveling at the same speed a total of 18 hours to travel across a highway, so that works out to (3 kangaroos/total time of 18 hours) = 8.322 million kilometers per hour. Four turtles, each traveling at half the speed of the kangaroos, would need twice as long to travel the same distance, or 36 hours.
