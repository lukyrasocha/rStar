First we need to determine how many customers were kicked out for not wearing a mask. The problem tells us that there were 3. Next, we can figure out the number of customers who were kicked out for shoplifting. It says that this amount is four times that of those who were kicked out for not wearing a mask minus 5. So let's plug in the first part (three) of our previous calculation into the equation and see what we get. 4 * 3 - 5 = 11. So there were eleven customers who were kicked out for shoplifting. Finally, we need to know how many customers were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. To do so, we will multiply the number of shoplifters by three. Since there were 11 shoplifters, 3 x 11 = 33. This is the total number of customers who were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale.

Four times the amount of shoplifters minus 5 was equal to three times the number of shoplifters plus 3. Four times the amount of shoplifters minus 5 could be written as 4x - 5. Three times the number of shoplifters plus 3 would be 3x + 3. Therefore, 4x - 5 = 3x + 3. This can be solved by subtracting 3x on both sides. 4x - 5 - 3x = 3x + 3 - 3x. 4x - 8x + 5 = 0. Subtract 5 from both sides. 4x - 8x = -5. Subtract 4x from both sides. -4x = -5. Divide both sides by -4. -5/-4 = x. x = -5/-4. Multiply both sides by -4. 5 = -4x. Divide both sides by -4. 5/-4 = -4x/-4. 5/-4 = x. x = -5/-4 = 5/4 = 1.25. Three times the number of shoplifters plus 3 is 3x + 3 = 3(1.25) + 3 = 3.75 + 3 = 6.75. Therefore, 3x + 3 = 6.75.
