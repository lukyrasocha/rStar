Let's start by identifying the relevant numbers. We know that the moon is 384,400 kilometers away from Earth, and we also know that Poppy is working on a 1000-piece jigsaw puzzle.\n\nNext, we need to understand what the problem is asking us to find. It's asking us to determine how many jigsaw pieces are left to be placed. To do this, we need to figure out how many pieces Poppy and her mom have already placed.\n\nPoppy has placed a quarter of the pieces on the board, so we can calculate the number of pieces she has placed by multiplying the total number of pieces (1000) by \u00bc. This means that she has placed 250 pieces on the board.\n\nPoppy's mom has placed a third of the remaining pieces. We know that Poppy has placed 250 pieces, so we can calculate the number of remaining pieces by subtracting 250 from 1000.

This means that Poppy's mom has placed 250 pieces.\n\nSo, the number of jigsaw pieces left to be placed is simply the number of remaining pieces minus the number of pieces that Poppy and her mom have already placed.

A quarter of something means that you divide it by four. Poppy had 1000 jigsaw pieces and placed a quarter of them on the board. 1000 / 4 = 250. So Poppy put 250 jigsaw pieces on the board. Next, we need to find the fraction of the remaining pieces her mother put on. According to the problem, her mother placed a third of the remaining pieces. We know that a third of something means dividing it by three. We also know that Poppy's mom put those pieces on the board after Poppy put a quarter of the pieces on the board. So we have to take away 250 from the total of 1000, leaving us with 750 pieces left. Those 750 pieces are the ones that Poppy's mom put on. So, we can multiply 750 by 1/3 to find out how many pieces were put on by Poppy's mom. (750 / 3 =) 250. Finally, we just add the two numbers together, 250 + 250, which equals 500.
