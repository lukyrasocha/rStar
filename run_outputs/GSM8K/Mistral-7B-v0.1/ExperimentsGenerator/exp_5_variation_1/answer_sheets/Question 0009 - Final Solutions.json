We know 3 people were kicked out for mask refusal. We also know another number equals to four times that many minus 5 was for shoplifting. Since it says that we want to find the rest of them for other reasons, let's just call this number B. Finally, we know that there were three times the number of shoplifters who were kicked out for violent behaviour. So if there are 4B people in total, then 4B - 5 was for shoplifting. And 4B - 5 / 4 will give us B people who were shoplifters, since we can divide the number of shoplifters by 4 because they were kicked out three times as many. Since there were 4B - 5 people in total, then 4B - 5 - (4B - 5)/4 people were kicked out for other reasons. So there were 4B - 5 - (4B - 5)/4 people who were kicked out for other reasons. Let's substitute 4B - 5 into that expression. 4B - 5 - (4(B-5/4) - 5)/4. We can take out the 4B because it's being multiplied by itself. 4B - 5 - (B - 5)/4. Or in other words, 4B - 5 - (B - 5). This will give us a number of B - 5, which is actually B minus 5. So there were B - 5 people who were kicked out for other reasons. But we already knew B. We don't need to solve for B because we have the information that 3 people were kicked out for refusing to wear masks. So there were 3 people who were kicked out for refusing to wear masks. We also know that B is 4B minus 5. So if there are 3 people who refused to wear masks, then 3 is 4B minus 5. So that means 4B minus 5 is 3 plus 5, or 8. So B is 8 divided by 4, or 2.

Four times the amount of shoplifters minus 5 was equal to three times the number of shoplifters plus 3. Four times the amount of shoplifters minus 5 could be written as 4x - 5. Three times the number of shoplifters plus 3 would be 3x + 3. Therefore, 4x - 5 = 3x + 3. This can be solved by subtracting 3x on both sides. 4x - 5 - 3x = 3x + 3 - 3x. 4x - 8x + 5 = 0. Subtract 5 from both sides. 4x - 8x = -5. Subtract 4x from both sides. -4x = -5. Divide both sides by -4. -5/-4 = x. x = -5/-4. Multiply both sides by -4. 5 = -4x. Divide both sides by -4. 5/-4 = -4x/-4. 5/-4 = x. x = -5/-4 = 5/4 = 1.25. Three times the number of shoplifters plus 3 is 3x + 3 = 3(1.25) + 3 = 3.75 + 3 = 6.75. Therefore, 3x + 3 = 6.75.

For moon, we can see that this is just a given fact. It doesn't need to be calculated. Next, we can see that three customers were kicked out because they didn't wear their masks. This means that the number of maskless people is 3. Next, we can look at the shoplifting section. We see that a number equal to four times the shoplifters minus 5 was kicked out. This is like saying that the number of shoplifters is equal to 4 * <sup>x</sup> - 5. This allows us to find out the value of x. Finally, we can see that 3 times the number of shoplifters were also kicked out for being violent towards store employees. Since we know the value of x already, we can use that to get 3 * <sup>x</sup>. From here, we can subtract the numbers in the shoplifter and violent sections to find the total number of people who were kicked out.

There were originally 3 customers who were kicked out of the Walmart for refusing to wear masks. So that's our starting point. A number equaled to four times that many minus 5 were kicked out for shoplifting. That number is equal to 4(number of shoplifters) - 5. Let's solve this equation. 4(number of shoplifters) - 5 = the number of customers kicked out of the Walmart for refusing to wear masks, or 3. Substitute 3 for the number of shoplifters into the equation and solve it again. 4(3)-5 = the number of customers kicked out of the Walmart for refusing to wear masks, or 3.
