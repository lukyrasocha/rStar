Each night, Cynthia eats 1 serving of ice cream. 1 serving is equivalent to 1/15 of a carton of ice cream. So if 1 carton has 15 servings of ice cream, then Cynthia needs 1/15 of 1 carton = 1/15 x 4.00 = 4.0/15 = 0.267 cartons to finish one serving. Since she buys cartons of ice cream with 15 servings of ice cream per carton, she needs 15/0.267 = 56.207 cartons of ice cream in all. To buy 56.207 cartons of ice cream, Cynthia needs 56.207 x 4.00 = 224.83 cartons of ice cream. So she can finish 1 serving of ice cream in 224.83 cartons. 1 serving = 1/15 of a carton, so 15 servings = 1 carton. Therefore, she can finish 15 servings of ice cream in 224.83 cartons. This means she can eat 15 servings of ice cream in 224.83 cartons. That is also equivalent to eating 15 cartons of ice cream. It takes Cynthia 224.83 cartons to eat 15 cartons of ice cream, so it takes Cynthia 224.83 cartons to eat 15 cartons of ice cream, which is the same as 15 cartons of ice cream. So it would take Cynthia 15 cartons of ice cream to eat 15 cartons of ice cream. Therefore, it would take Cynthia 15 cartons of ice cream to eat 15 cartons of ice cream. Finally, she can eat 15 cartons of ice cream in 15 days. 224.83 cartons divided by 15 cartons per day is equal to 15 days.
