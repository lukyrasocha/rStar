This means we need to take 2/5ths away from the total cost. We know that 5/5ths is equal to 1, so we can use this fact to figure out what 2/5ths would be: 2/5ths is equivalent to 2/5*1 or simply 2/5.

The company sold 4000 gallons of milk to Mr. Marcellus's store. Each gallon costs 3.5 dollars. So 4000 x 3.5 = 14,000 dollars. The answer is: 14000.\n\nHint: Determine what portion of the total quantity of milk purchased by Mr. Marcellus has passed the expiration date. We know from the problem that Mr. Marcellus can only sell 4/5 of the original milk because 1/5 of it has expired. So we need to calculate the quantity of expired milk.\n\nHint: To calculate the quantity of expired milk, multiply the quantity of the original milk and the proportion of expired milk. The quantity of the original milk is 4000 gallons. Since 2/5 of it is expired, the proportion of expired milk is 2/5. So we get 4000 * 2/5 = 1600 gallons. Thus the quantity of the expired milk is 1600 gallons.\n\nHint: Calculate how much Mr. Marcellus paid for the expired milk. Mr. Marcellus paid 3.5 dollars for each gallon of milk. The quantity of the expired milk is 1600 gallons. So we get 1600 * 3.5 = 5600 dollars. This represents how much Mr. Marcellus paid for the expired milk.\n\nHint: Use subtraction to determine the quantity of milk which has not expired. Let's subtract the quantity of expired milk from the original quantity. We get 4000 - 1600 = 2400 gallons. This represents the quantity of milk which has not expired.\n\nHint: Calculate how much Mr. Marcellus paid for the remaining milk. Mr. Marcellus paid 3.5 dollars for each gallon of milk. The quantity of the remaining milk is 2400 gallons. So we get 2400 * 3.5 = 8400 dollars. This represents how much Mr. Marcellus paid for the remaining milk.\n\nHint: Subtract the amount of money which Mr. Marcellus paid for the expired milk from the amount of money which Mr. Marcellus paid for the remaining milk to obtain the refunded amount. We get 8400 - 5600 = 2800 dollars. This represents the refunded amount.\n\nHint: Add the refunded amount to the quantity of the milk which has not expired to find the result.
