First, calculate the total price of each item. A notebook costs $1.50 each, so five notebooks cost 1.5 x 5 = $7.50. A pen costs $0.25 each, so two pens cost 0.25 x 2 = $0.50. A calculator costs $12, so it costs $12 each. And a geometry set costs $10 each. Multiply the price of each item by the quantity to get the total price of the item. The total price of five notebooks is 5 x $7.50 = $37.50. The total price of two pens is 2 x $0.50 = $1.00. The total price of one calculator is 1 x $12 = $12.00. The total price of one geometry set is 1 x $10 = $10.00. Add up the total prices of each item to get the total price of everything. The total price of the notebooks is $37.50, the total price of the pens is $1.00, the total price of the calculator is $12.00, and the total price of the geometry set is $10.00. So, the total price of everything is $37.50 + $1.00 + $12.00 + $10.00 = $60.50. Then apply the 10% discount. To apply the 10% discount, we multiply the total price by 0.90. The total price before the discount was $60.50, so the total price after the discount is $60.50 x 0.90 = $54.45.
