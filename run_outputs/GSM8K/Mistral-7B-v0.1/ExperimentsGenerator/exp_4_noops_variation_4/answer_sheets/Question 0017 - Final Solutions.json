To find the answer, we need to know the total distance and Michael's average speed. The distance between Alaska and Texas is 6000 kilometers. Michael travels at an average speed of 50 kilometers per hour. We can use these values to calculate the total time needed for Michael to cover the entire distance. Distance / Speed = Time. Therefore, the total time required to complete the journey is 6000 kilometers / 50 kilometers per hour = 120 hours. Since Michael plans to make multiple stops during his journey, let's assume he spends half the time resting and making stops, leaving him with 60 hours of actual driving time. To calculate the percentage of the distance he has covered, divide the distance traveled by the total distance and multiply by 100%. So, the percentage of the distance he has covered is (Distance traveled * 100%) / Total distance. In this case, Michael has driven for 60 hours, so he has travelled 60 * 50 kilometers per hour = 3000 kilometers. Therefore, the percentage of the distance he has covered is (3000 kilometers * 100%) / 6000 kilometers = 50%.
