The number of players on the special teams is the same as the number of players on the defense because we said there were half the number of players on the special teams as there was on the defense. So 3d/2 = d. Solving for d, we get d = 3d/2. Multiplying both sides by 2 and dividing by 3, we get d = 2/3 * d. Simplifying, we get 2 * d / 3 = d.
