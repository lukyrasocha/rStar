The number of employees is not stated, so there might be even fewer people who want to go on the trip. However, if all employees join the trip, it will exceed the vehicle capacity, so the answer is less than or equal to 570. We can use the equation 570 = N * C where N is the maximum number of employees who can go on the trip and C is the average capacity per person (we don't know what it is exactly). Using some common sense and assuming that it's 2 people per vehicle, we get 570 / 2 = 285, which is too large a number of people. This means that there would be no room for people who want to go on the trip. Instead, let's try the opposite extreme, a very small number of people who want to go. In this case, all 570 seats can be filled, so let's try N = 1. Using the same equation, we get 570 = 1 * C, which implies that C = 570. This seems reasonable because all the seats could be occupied. Therefore, the answer is less than or equal to 570, but there might be more or fewer people.
