{"id": 1235, "problem": "The moon is about 384,400 kilometers away from Earth. Michael is traveling on the interstate at an average speed of 50 km/hr (taking into account all the necessary stops for gas, relaxation, etc.). If Michael goes on like this for 3 days, and the distance between Alaska and Texas is 6000 km, what percentage of this distance has Michael covered?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "There are 24 hours in each day, so Michael has been traveling for a total of 3 * 24 = <<3*24=72>>72 hours.\nAt a rate of 50 km/hr, Michael has covered 50 * 72 = <<50*72=3600>>3600 km.\n3600 km as a percentage of 6000 km is (3600/6000)*100% = <<(3600/6000)*100=60>>60%\n#### 60", "gold_answer": "60"}
