The first time Jim watches TV, he spends 2 hours doing it. The next time he read for half as long, which would be 1 hour. Since he does these things three times a week, in a week, he will spend 2 + 1 = 3 hours watching TV or reading. There are 4 weeks in a month. So in 4 weeks, he would spend 3 hours each week, for a total of 12 hours.
