First, let's determine the number of calories Sue consumed. On Monday, Sue ate four times as many cookies as her sister. Since her sister ate 5 cookies on Monday, we know that Sue ate 5 x 4 = 20 cookies on Monday. Each cookie has 200 calories, so Sue ate 20 x 200 = 4000 calories. On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister. Since her sister ate 13 cookies on Tuesday, we know that Sue ate 13 x 2 = 26 cookies on Tuesday. That's another 26 x 200 = 5200 calories. So Sue ate a total of 4000 + 5200 = 9200 calories.\n\nTo find the difference between what Sue consumed and her sister, we can subtract the number of calories Sue's sister consumed from the number of calories Sue consumed. To get the number of calories Sue's sister consumed, we need to determine how many calories her sister consumed on each day. On Monday, her sister ate 5 cookies, so she consumed 5 x 200 = 1000 calories. On Tuesday, she ate 13 cookies, so she consumed 13 x 200 = 2600 calories. That's a total of 1000 + 2600 = 3600 calories. To get the difference, we subtract the calories her sister consumed from those Sue consumed. That's 9200 - 3600 = 5600. So Sue consumed 5600 more calories than her sister.
