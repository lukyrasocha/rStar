It took 12 minutes for the coat of varnish on 1 painting with the new varnish to dry. For the second question, it took 7 minutes for the coat of varnish on 1 painting with the old varnish to dry. We can use those times to find out how long it took for 6 paintings to dry with the new varnish and the old varnish. It takes 12 minutes for 1 painting with the new varnish to dry. 6 paintings will take 6 * 12 = 72 minutes. Now we need to figure out how long it takes to dry 6 paintings with the old varnish.
