First, we need to convert the kilometers into meters. Each kilometer is 1000 meters. So there are 9.461 trillion kilometers in a light-year. This means 9.461 * 1000 meters. Next, we need to calculate the cost of each uniform. Each uniform comes with a hat, a jacket, and pants. The hat costs 25 dollars, the jacket costs 3 times the price of the hat, and the pants cost the average of the costs of the hat and jacket. The jacket costs (3 * 25) dollars. However, the pants cost half of the sum of the prices of the hat and the jacket. This is because if we add together the prices of the hat and the jacket, then the pants would be half of that sum. Thus, (hat_price + jacket_price) / 2. Since the jacket costs 3 times the price of the hat, we can use an equation like (3*hat_price) + (hat_price + 3*hat_price) / 2. Let's solve for the average price of the hat and jacket. We can find the sum of the prices of the hat and jacket by adding them together. (hat_price + jacket_price) / 2 is just another way of saying (sum of the prices of the hat and jacket) / 2. The jacket costs (3 * 25) dollars. To find the sum of the prices of the hat and jacket, we take the sum of the prices of the hat and jacket. (3 * 25) + (3 * 25) = (3 * 50) = 150. So the pants cost (150) / 2 = 75.

We can write this equation like this: y = (25 + x) / 2 = (25 + 75) / 2 = 100 / 2 = 50\n\nFinally, we can find the total cost of the uniform by adding together the cost of the hat, jacket, and pants.

First let's figure out the cost of each item in the uniform. The cost of a hat is 25 dollars. The cost of a jacket is 3 times as much as the cost of a hat, so it costs 3 x 25 = 75 dollars. The cost of pants is the average of the costs of the hat and jacket, which is (25 + 75) / 2 = 50 dollars. Now we can add up the costs of each item in the uniform. The total cost of the uniform is 25 (cost of hat) + 75 (cost of jacket) + 50 (cost of pants) = 150 dollars.
