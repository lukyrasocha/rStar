So she eats once every day. That means she eats once every 24 hours. And she eats 60 times in 60 days. Next, let's find out how many servings she eats in 60 days. She eats 60 times. Each time she eats one serving. So she eats 60 servings in 60 days. Next, let's find out how many cartons of ice cream she will need for those servings. We can divide 60 servings by 15 to get 4.
