According to the problem, the Marching Band is ordering new uniforms. Each uniform comes with a hat that costs 25, a jacket that costs 3 times as much as the hat, and pants that cost the average of the costs of the hat and jacket.\n\nSo, we know that the cost of the hat is 25, and the cost of the jacket is three times as much as the hat. This means we can find the cost of the jacket by multiplying the cost of the hat by 3. Let's call the cost of the jacket x. We can write this equation like this: x = 3 * 25 = 75\n\nNow, we know that the cost of the pants is the average of the costs of the hat and jacket. This means we can find the cost of the pants by taking the average of 25 and x. Let's call the cost of the pants y. We can write this equation like this: y = (25 + x) / 2 = (25 + 75) / 2 = 100 / 2 = 50\n\nFinally, we can find the total cost of the uniform by adding together the cost of the hat, jacket, and pants.
