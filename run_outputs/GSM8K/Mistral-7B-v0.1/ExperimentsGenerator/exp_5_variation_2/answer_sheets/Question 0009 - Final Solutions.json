We know that a total of 50 people were kicked out. 4 times the number of shoplifters minus 5 was also 50. This means 50 = 4z - 5. Also, 3 times the number of people who were kicked out for shoplifting was the same as the number of people who were kicked out for physical violence. Let's call them w. This means 3w = z. Now we have 50 = 4z - 5 and 3w = z. The first one can be solved as 50 = 4z - 5. Add 5 on both sides. 55 = 4z. Divide both sides by 4. z = 13.75. And the second equation is 3w = z. Substitute z with 13.75. 3w = 13.75. Divide both sides by 3. w = 4.583. Finally, find the number of people who were kicked out for other reasons. The only way this could be possible is if the number was exactly half the number of people who were kicked out for not wearing masks. Because otherwise, it would not be enough to make the difference of 5 people. Also, let's say the number of people who were kicked out for not wearing masks was x. This means 5 = x/2. Multiply both sides by 2. 10 = x. 50 = x + 3(x) + 2(x) + (x). Substitute x with 10. 50 = 10 + 3(10) + 2(10) + (10). Simplify the terms in brackets. 50 = 30 + 20 + 10. 50 = 60.

Also, we know that four times that many minus 5 were kicked out for shoplifting. We can write it like this: (4 x number of shoplifters) - 5 = x. The third equation is that 3 customers were kicked out of the Walmart for refusing to wear masks. We can write it like this: (number of people kicked out for other reasons) + 3 = x. Let's solve for x. (number of people kicked out for other reasons) = x. Then plug the first equation into the second equation.

First, let's find the total number of people who were kicked out of the Walmart. It says that a total of 50 people were kicked out. So there are 50 people in all. Now, let's break them down into categories. There were 3 people who refused to wear masks, so there are 50 - 3 = 47 people left. Of the remaining 47 people, 3 times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. That means that there were 3 * (the number of shoplifters) people kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. This means that there were 47 - 3 * (the number of shoplifters) people left. Finally, there was one person who wasn't a mask refuser or a shoplifter, which makes 47 - 3 * (the number of shoplifters) + 1 = 48 - 3 * (the number of shoplifters) people who were kicked out for other reasons. We can solve for (the number of shoplifters) to get our final answer. 48 - 3 * (the number of shoplifters) = 48 - 3x, where x is the number of shoplifters. Now we can substitute the values we know into this equation. 48 - 3x = 48 - 3 * (the number of shoplifters), where the number of shoplifters is 48 - 3x divided by 3. Substituting in the value for (the number of shoplifters) gives us 48 - 3 * (48 - 3x) / 3 = 48 - 3 * (48 - 3x) / 3 = 48 - 144 + 9x / 3 = 9x / 3 = 3x. Therefore, the number of shoplifters was 3x. Now that we know the number of shoplifters, we can calculate the number of people who were kicked out for other reasons. As I mentioned before, there were 48 - 3 * (the number of shoplifters) people who were kicked out for other reasons. But we already calculated that the number of shoplifters was 3x.

Since a number equal to four times that many minus 5 was kicked out for shoplifting, we can use algebra to solve this part. Let x represent the number of people who were kicked out for shoplifting. Four times x, minus 5, equals the number of people who were kicked out for shoplifting. So, four times x minus 5 equals the number of people who were kicked out for shoplifting. Solving for x using algebra, we get x = (number of people who were kicked out for shoplifting) / 4 + 5 / 4. Using the information provided, we know that three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence, so three times x, or three times (number of people who were kicked out for shoplifting) divided by 4 plus five divided by 4, were kicked out for physical violence. Therefore, three times x divided by 4 plus five divided by 4 were kicked out for physical violence. This means that x divided by 4 plus one and a quarter were kicked out for physical violence.

Three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. If a total of 50 people were kicked out of the Walmart, we can solve this problem as follows:\n\n  1. Let n be the number of people who were kicked out of the Walmart for mask refusal (mask_refusal).\n  2. So 3 customers were kicked out because of mask_refusal. This means 3 = n.\n  3. A number equals to four times that many minus 5 were kicked out for shoplifting (shoplifting). This means (4n - 5) were kicked out for shoplifting.\n  4. Three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale (physical_violence_over_goods_on_sale). This means 3(4n - 5) were kicked out for physical_violence_over_goods_on_sale.\n  5. We know that there were 50 people kicked out of the Walmart. This means 50 = n + (4n - 5) + 3(4n - 5).

Number of people being kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale is 3 * (number of people being kicked out for shoplifting). These three numbers add up to 50. So (50 - 3) - (4 * 3 - 5) - (3 * (4 * 3 - 5)) = 3. The answer is: 3.\n\n<details>\n  <summary><b>Explanation</b></summary>\n\nWe need to find the number of people being kicked out for other reasons. This number is equal to the total number of people being kicked out minus the number of people being kicked out for refusing to wear masks, minus the number of people being kicked out for shoplifting, minus the number of people being kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. Let's define these numbers as follows:\n\n* `x`: Number of people being kicked out for refusing to wear masks\n* `y`: Number of people being kicked out for shoplifting\n* `z`: Number of people being kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale\n\nWe know the total number of people being kicked out is 50. We also know that the number of people being kicked out for refusing to wear masks is 3, and the number of people being kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale is 3 * (number of people being kicked out for shoplifting). Since we already know that the number of people being kicked out for refusing to wear masks is 3, we can replace it with `x`. Similarly, since we know that the number of people being kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale is 3 * (number of people being kicked out for shoplifting), we can replace it with `3 * y`. Therefore, we get the following expression:\n\n```\n50 = x + y + z\n```\n\nFrom the given information, we also know that the number of people being kicked out for shoplifting is 4 * (number of people being kicked out for refusing to wear masks) - 5. Replacing the number of people being kicked out for refusing to wear masks with `x`, we get:\n\n```\ny = 4 * x - 5\n```\n\nSubstituting this into our original expression, we get:\n\n```\n50 = x + (4 * x - 5) + 3 * (4 * x - 5)\n```\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n```\n50 = 7 * x - 5 + 12 * x - 15\n```\n\nCollecting like terms, we get:\n\n```\n50 = 19 * x - 20\n```\n\nFinally, solving for `x`, we get:\n\n```\nx = (50 + 20) / 19\n```\n\nPlugging back into our original expression, we get:\n\n```\ny = 4 * (50 + 20) / 19 - 5\n```\n\nAnd finally, solving for `z`:\n\n```\nz = 3 * (4 * (50 + 20) / 19 - 5)\n```\n\nSo the number of people being kicked out for other reasons is simply `(50 - x - y - z)`.\n\n</details>", "value": 0.125}}}, "rollout_id": 1}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "There are 206 bones in the adult human body. 3 customers were kicked out of the Walmart for refusing to wear masks.

We know that the number who were kicked out for shoplifting is equal to four times that many minus 5. Four times that many equals 5 + 5 = 10. This means that there were ten people who were kicked out for shoplifting. Since there were also three times the number of shoplifters who were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale, we can solve this as well. Three times the number of shoplifters equals 3 x 10 = 30. This tells us that there were 30 people who were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale.

We need to figure out which ones were kicked out for reasons other than the three mentioned in the question. The three groups we need to count are those who refused to wear masks, those who shoplifted, and those who engaged in physical violence over items on sale. Of these three groups, the first group was kicked out for refusing to wear masks. This means that their numbers are equal to four times that of the second group minus 5. Let's call the number of people who were kicked out for not wearing masks x. Four times this number minus 5 is x + 4x \u2013 5 = 5x \u2013 5. Thus, we can see that the number of people who were kicked out for not wearing masks is equivalent to 5x \u2013 5. Similarly, the number of people who were kicked out for physical violence over items on sale is equal to 3 times the number of people who were kicked out for shoplifting. Let's call the number of people who were kicked out for shoplifting y. Therefore, the number of people who were kicked out for physical violence over items on sale is 3y. Finally, the number of people who were kicked out for reasons other than the three mentioned in the question is equal to the total number of people who were kicked out (50) minus the number of people who were kicked out for not wearing masks (5x \u2013 5) minus the number of people who were kicked out for physical violence over items on sale (3y).

Then there were 3 customers who were kicked out of the Walmart for refusing to wear masks. Next there were 3 times the number of shoplifters who were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. Finally a total of 50 people were kicked out of the Walmart.\n\nLet's try to solve it. The number of bones is 206. Let's call that variable x. The number of customers who refused to wear masks is 3. That is y. The number of shoplifters is also x. The number of people who were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale is also x. Finally, the total amount of people who were kicked out was 50.\n\nSo we can write equations. 206 = x. And 3 = y. Since x shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale, then 3x = z. And since all together 50 people were kicked out, 3x + y + z = 50.\n\nWe need to isolate x and z.\n\nTo isolate x, subtract 3y from both sides. We get 206 - 3y = x.\n\nTo isolate z, subtract 3x + y from both sides. We get 50 - 3x - y = z.\n\nNow we know what x and z equal to. To find out y, we can substitute them into 3y + z = 50.\n\nSubstituting 206 - 3y for x, and 50 - 3x - y for z, we have 3y + 50 - 3(206 - 3y) - y = 50. Rearranging the terms, we have 3y + 3y - 618 + 3y - 3y + 50 = 50. Simplifying, we have 13y = 268. Dividing by 13 on both sides, we have y = 21.\n\nSo y equals 21. That means there were 21 customers who refused to wear masks. Substituting 21 for y into 3x + 21 = 50, we have 3x + 21 = 50. Subtracting 21 from both sides, we have 3x = 29. Dividing by 3 on both sides, we have x = 9.\n\nSo x equals 9. That means there were 9 shoplifters who were kicked out of the Walmart for physical violence over goods on sale.\n\nWe know that y is 21. We also know that z is 50 - 3x - y. Substituting 21 for y, and 9 for x, we have z = 50 - 3(9) - 21 = 3.\n\nFinally, there were 3 people kicked out of the Walmart for other reasons.

We can represent this as N. We know that 206 is N. A number equals to 4N - 5 were kicked out for shoplifting. We also know that 3N were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. And finally, we are told that a total of 50 people were kicked out of the Walmart. This means we want to figure out how many were kicked out for other reasons. So if 3N were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale, then 50 - 3N must be the number of people who were kicked out for other reasons. In order to solve for N, we can use algebra. We know 206 is N. And we know that 3N were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. So we can write this equation: (4N - 5) + 3N = 50. Let's simplify this equation by adding 5 to both sides of the equation. We get (4N - 5) + 3N + 5 = 50 + 5. Now let's simplify further. We get 4N + 3N + 5 = 55. So we can combine terms like this: 7N + 5 = 55. To isolate N, we subtract 5 from both sides of the equation. We get 7N + 5 - 5 = 55 - 5. Now we can isolate N by subtracting 5 on both sides. We get 7N = 50. Dividing both sides by 7, we find that N = 50/7. So 50/7 people were kicked out of the Walmart for other reasons.
