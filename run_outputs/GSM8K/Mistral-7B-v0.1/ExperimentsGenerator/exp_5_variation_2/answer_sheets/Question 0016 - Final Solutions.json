If the number of strides multiplied by the distance of one stride gives the total distance traveled, then this is 42.195 kilometer per stride times 1 stride, which gives 42.195 kilometers. Now let's look at the milk situation. To figure out what was returned because it expired, we first take the total amount of milk and multiply it by 2/5. This means that 2/5 of the milk was expired. With 4000 gallons of milk and 2/5 of that being returned, 2/5 times 4000 equals 1600.

Let's start with the second question first, because it uses the information from the first question. In order to calculate the amount of refund Mr. Marcellus received, we need to know how many gallons of milk he purchased. We can use the information provided in the first question to determine this. In the first question, we are told that the marathon is 42.195 kilometers long, and that the company sold 4000 gallons of milk in jars at the cost of $3.5 per gallon to Mr. Marcellus's store.\n\nWe also know that a marathon is 42.195 kilometers long, and that 1 stride is approximately 100 meters. We can divide the length of the marathon by the length of one stride to get the number of strides required to run the marathon. 42.195 kilometers / 1 stride = 42.195 kilometer per stride. We can then multiply the number of strides by the distance of one stride to determine the total distance traveled. 42.195 kilometer per stride x 1 stride = 42.195 kilometers.\n\nNow, we can use the information from the first question to calculate how many gallons of milk Mr. Marcellus purchased. We know that the company sold 4000 gallons of milk in jars to Mr. Marcellus's store, and that 1 stride is approximately 100 meters. We can divide 4000 gallons by the number of strides required to run the marathon (42.195 kilometers / 1 stride) to get the number of gallons of milk Mr. Marcellus purchased. 4000 gallons / (42.195 kilometers / 1 stride) = 941.1563636 gallons.\n\nIn order to calculate the remaining milk after it passed the expiry date, we need to multiply the amount of milk purchased by 2/5. 4000 gallons x 2/5 = 1600 gallons. This means that 1600 gallons of the milk Mr. Marcellus purchased was not able to be sold due to having passed the expiry date.\n\nNow, we can use this information to calculate the refund Mr. Marcellus received. We know that Mr. Marcellus paid $3.5 per gallon for the milk, and that 1600 gallons of the milk was not able to be sold due to having passed the expiry date.
