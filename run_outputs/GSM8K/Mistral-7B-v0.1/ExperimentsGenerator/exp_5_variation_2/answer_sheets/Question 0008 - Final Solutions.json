Light travels at a speed of 299,792 km per second. That is pretty fast! And there are 105 people on the football team. Let's look at the offense first. Since there are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense, we can divide the number of players on the defense by 2 to get the number of players on the offense. The problem tells us that there are 5 times as many players on the offense as there are on the special teams. To find the number of players on the special teams, we can multiply the number of players on the defense by 5. But the number of players on the special teams is actually half of the number of players on the defense. So we multiply the number of players on the defense by 5/2. This gives us 105/2 * 5/2 = 105/2 * 1/2 = 25/2 = 12.5 players. Now let's go back to the original question about the number of players on the defense.

Finally, there is half the number of players on the special teams as there is on the defense. The question asks how many players are on the defense. We know that there are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense. That means that 2 times the number of players on offense is the number of players on defense. Likewise, we also know that there is half the number of players on the special teams as there is on the defense. This means that half the number of players on special teams is equal to the number of players on defense. Using these two equations, we can set them equal to each other. 2 times the number of players on offense is equal to half the number of players on special teams. Solving for the number of players on offense, we get the equation 2n=h where n represents the number of players on offense and h represents the number of players on special teams. Substituting in our known values, we get 2*105=h. Solving this equation, we find that h is equal to 210.
