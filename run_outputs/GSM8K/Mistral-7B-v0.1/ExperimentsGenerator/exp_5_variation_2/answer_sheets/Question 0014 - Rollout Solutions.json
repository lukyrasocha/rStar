That would be 8,848 meters. Next, we need to find out how long it takes the 3 kangaroos to cross the highway. It takes them 18 hours to finish the task.\n\nTo determine the amount of time it would take for 4 turtles (each moving at half the speed of the kangaroos) to cross the highway, we first need to calculate how fast the kangaroos are going, since the turtles only move at half of that speed. To calculate this, we can use the formula for average speed, which is distance divided by time. Since we know the distance (the length of the highway) and the time it took for the kangaroos to complete the journey (18 hours), we can plug these values into the equation:\n\nAverage Speed = Distance / Time\nAverage Speed = 1 / 18\nAverage Speed = .0555555556 m/h\n\nNow that we know the speed of the kangaroos, we can determine the speed of the turtles. As mentioned earlier, the turtles move at half the speed of the kangaroos, so their speed would be half of what we just calculated.\n\nTurtle Speed = Kangaroo Speed / 2\nTurtle Speed = .0555555556 / 2\nTurtle Speed = .0277777778 m/h\n\nNext, we need to calculate the time it would take the turtles to cross the highway. We can use the same formula we used for the kangaroos, but with the new values we just determined.\n\nTime = Distance / Speed\nTime = 1 / .0277777778\nTime = 36 hrs\n\nTherefore, it would take 4 turtles, each moving at half the speed of a kangaroo, 36 hours to cross the highway.
