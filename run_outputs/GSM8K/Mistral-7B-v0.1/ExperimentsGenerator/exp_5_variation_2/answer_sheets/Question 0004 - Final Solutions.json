One fourth of 1000 is 1000 / 4 = 250. Therefore, Poppy has placed 250 pieces on the board.\nNow, let's focus on what her mom has done. We know that her mom has placed a third of the remaining pieces.

We can divide this total volume by 78%, which will give us the number of liters of nitrogen in the atmosphere. This number divided by the total volume will be the percentage of nitrogen. Let's denote the total volume of air in Earth's atmosphere as V, and the volume of nitrogen in the atmosphere as V\\_{n}. So V / 78% = V\\_{n} and V\\_{n} / V = 78%.
