        " Cynthia consumes ice cream daily which lasts until 60 days; hence this can easily imply that over these 60 days period, she needs buy (60/1) cartons because each container serves upwards to ten times so therefore we get that cynthia will consum all those containers within sixty days if possible or fewer according to what was provided initially.. This implies mathematically as follows:$n= \\frac{d}{t}$ ($where$ n-$is$, here,$the~$number~of~$cartons)$$\\therefore ~~~=$ $\\left(\\frac {60~days}~{(15~servings)/(one~bag)}$ right$?$$simplifying,\\...\\:\\:$ ${=}\\left (\\frac {60*1}~{15}}~\\right) \\,=\\,~$ {$=~~}=~~$\\text{-}~~4.$Since each such item i.e., \"$each~$container\" ~$(also\\,known~as~a~$carton)$contains $(one~serve)*${({($1.25)+((x+y)-cost)})}$,then finally substituting values into equation above yields : $$=(price)\\,per\\, serve)\\,\\,times~~~~number\\,\\,andized-\\,(negative sign),................._{total\\_spent}$$[$Where \\$x$- represents quantity purchased $-quantity available \\;for\\;use]$For example,if you purchase four items but pay only for three (i.e.:buying extra,-free ) :- then effectively:- your overall expenditure equals $[CostOfThreeItems]-(ValueOfOneMissingItem)$.Likewise:\\\\[TotalSpent=-[(PricePerServe)]*(NumberPurchased)-\\,(NegativeSign)(ValueUnused)\\\\](Note::herein using negative since value unutilised due no longer applicable). Thus concludes our analysis.This translates practially like reading out loud numbers when asked ,what 'sum'-numbers add upto ie.,we read out '$two'$ digits instead.-Example:\"Two plus Three\".In order find sum:(or just skip negatives & focus primarily upon positive terms): \\\\[-\\\\begin{{array}}{lcl}[&TrivialSolution:]&& TotalMoneyUsed&=2ndNum*\\Bigg(\\dfrac N T\\\\ &=(six tens)--(60.)\\\\\\newline&& [End]:&\\qquad TotAmountFactorled",
