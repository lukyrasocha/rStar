David is a engineering student, and David wants to buy 10 notebooks, 3 pens, 1 calculator, and 1 geometry set. The shop gives a 15% discount on all the purchased items. How much does David have to spend on all the items David wants to buy?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "10 notebooks cost 10 x $1 = $<<10*1=10>>10.\n3 pens cost 3 x $2 = $<<3*2=6>>6.\nThe total cost is $10 + $6 = $<<10+6=16>>40.\nThe total discount is 15% of $40 = $<<15*40/100=6>>6.\nTherefore, David has to spend $40 - $6 = $<<40-6=34>>34 on all the items David wants to buy.\n#### 34", "gold_answer": "34"}
