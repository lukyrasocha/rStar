{"id": 1145, "problem": "Charles owns a flower shop. He sells a sunflower that costs $4 each and a bouquet of sunflower that costs $2. If Charles earned $20 from the sunflower and $45 from the bouquet per day, and if each bouquet has 14 sunflowers, how many sunflowers was Charles able to sell after 1 days?", "model_completion": null, "model_answer": null, "all_model_completions": {}, "gold_solution": "Charles sold $45 / $2 = <<45/2=22.5>>22.5 bouquets of sunflower.\nSo he was able to sell a total of 14 x 22.5 = <<14*22.5=315>>315 sunflowers from the bouquets.\nAnd he was able to sell a total of $20/$4= <<20/4=5>>5 Sunflowers.\nThe sum of sunflowers Charles was able to sell is 315 + 5 = <<315+5=320>>320.\nTherefore, the total of sunflowers he sold after 1 days is 320 x 1 = <<320*1=320>>320.\n#### 320", "gold_answer": "320"}
